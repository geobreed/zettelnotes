It seems like there's always some country or another that the United States is imposing sanctions on. The reasons change, but the idea is always the same: economic coercion. This month, it's Iran. In response to Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons, President Obama signed a law that punishes banks for doing business with Iran's central bank. This makes it difficult, in theory, for Iran to sell its oil around the world. You can see why sanctions are so appealing for the U.S. government: Rather than go to war to stop Iran's nuclear program — to risk American lives — the U.S. can block money from going in and out of the country. That makes life miserable for the Iranians and, in theory, persuades them to give up their nuclear ambitions. But do sanctions work? Have sanctions ever really worked? Today, we talk to Gary Hufbauer, author of the book Economic Sanctions Reconsidered. And we hear a first-hand account of what life in Iraq was like under the sanctions of the 1990s.

Sanctions have become an increasingly common foreign policy tool for the U.S. How effective are they?

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

Economic sanctions - these are restrictions one country will impose on another to prevent it from trading or doing business with other countries. The Treasury Department oversees them.

CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST:

Yeah, sanctions became popular after World War One as a way to pressure a country into doing something - or in some cases, into not doing something - but without resorting to war. By using a country's economy or, in the case of an individual, freezing their finances, the U.S. has used sanctions to do everything from trying to catch specific drug traffickers to undermining a particular government's regime. This is THE INDICATOR. I'm Cardiff Garcia.

VANEK SMITH: And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. Today on the show, economic sanctions. The U.S. has sanctions in place against more than two dozen countries and more than 7,000 companies, individuals and groups. That is more economic sanctions than at any other time in U.S. history.

GARCIA: So today on the show, sanctions - do they actually work? And what impact do they end up having on the country that gets sanctioned on its economy and on its people?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

VANEK SMITH: Some of the sanctions the U.S. has in place have really deep roots. U.S. sanctions against Cuba go back decades. Some sanctions are really new. Our latest sanctions against Iran went into effect just a few weeks ago.

GARCIA: Dan Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Tufts University School of Law and Diplomacy. He's also the author of "The Sanctions Paradox." So we asked him, are sanctions an effective way to make a country do something that it doesn't want to do?

DAN DREZNER: The way - the best analogy I can always use is to think about it as batting averages, where even a really, really good baseball hitter is more likely than not going to get out. And the same is true of sanctions. Even the best sanctions have at best a 50/50 shot of working.

GARCIA: Still, Dan says, sanctions should not be used lightly because the downsides are real. Especially, he says, when you sanction a whole country. So he adds that there are four key elements that can help sanctions be successful.

DREZNER: The first is - and I know this sounds banal - but that your demand is actually specific. In other words, you make it very clear what the target needs to do in order for sanctions to be lifted.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, like stop developing your nuclear program or whatever it is.

DREZNER: Right, exactly. But there have been many cases where the U.S. in particular has imposed sanctions on another country, and it hasn't been entirely clear what they could do to get the sanctions lifted. The case of Iran is a fascinating one for example because for the longest time, the sanctions that were imposed against Iran, it wasn't clear whether the sanctions were about the nuclear program, or was the purpose of the sanctions to try to foment regime change? And you could argue that the Iranian nuclear deal wasn't negotiated until the Obama administration - and before that, the Bush administration - made it clear that the goal was not regime change. The goal was in fact to address the nonproliferation concern.

VANEK SMITH: Dan says the current demands on Iran by the Trump administration seem really unclear and really broad when he read them. And he says this might make U.S. sanctions against Iran much less likely to be effective.

GARCIA: The second rule of sanctions, Dan says, is that it helps if you are allies in some way with the country that you are sanctioning or at least that you do some business with that country. Dan says that means there's an important relationship at stake. Otherwise, there's just not as much to lose because the ties aren't that strong. So that's rule number two - sanction your friends.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

GARCIA: Or at least your frenemies, I guess.

VANEK SMITH: Always sanction your frenemies.

GARCIA: Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Rule number three - go after the money, not the products. Dan says trade-based sanctions, where a particular product is sanctioned, such as oil or natural gas, those are far less effective than cutting a country off from the U.S. financial system. Dan says financial sanctions work much better.

DREZNER: So in many ways, if you try to impose a trade embargo of some kind, as I said, you're incentivizing black market activity. And local traders are going to be perfectly happy to bust sanctions, and they're not really going to worry about - let's say - losing access to the U.S. market. On the other hand, when you talk about financial sanctions, the dollar is such an important part of global capital markets that any reputable bank does not want to risk running afoul of the United States Treasury.

VANEK SMITH: The U.S. sanctions against Iran are both trade sanctions and financial sanctions.

GARCIA: Rule number four - make sure you've got a lot of other countries on board.

VANEK SMITH: All those frenemies.

GARCIA: (Laughter) Yeah, exactly. Because otherwise, the country being sanctioned can more easily find other ways to do business. Or even worse, they might start to cut you out of the system. So in the case of Iran, says Dan, this is potentially a problem down the line. Europe did not sign on to the sanctions with Iran. The sanctions are still powerful, he says, because the dollar and the U.S. banking system are so crucial to doing international business. But, he says, now there are quite a few major countries with big economies who have a strong incentive to work together.

VANEK SMITH: Suddenly, China, Russia and the European Union all have a strong motivation to find a way around the dollar and the U.S. financial system.

DREZNER: The problem isn't so much every individual case of sanctions. It's that we're sort of approaching the point where if you step back, it seems that we're using this tool an awful lot. And here, the concern becomes if the United States continues to abuse the privilege that it possesses because of the dollar's centrality to global capital markets, you're going to start incentivizing actors to find alternatives to the dollar.

VANEK SMITH: We'll lose our leverage, in other words.

DREZNER: Yeah, exactly.

GARCIA: One downside of sanctions is that the more places you sanction, the harder it gets to effectively sanction. But there's another downside, one that's a lot more human. Branko Milanovic as an economist at the City University of New York, and he specializes in inequality. He says sanctions against countries often make inequality in those countries worse because the sanctions tend to hit the people who have the least power and are the most economically vulnerable the hardest.

BRANKO MILANOVIC: Blanket sanctions, I think, actually are fundamentally wrong. Their objective is ostensibly to change the behavior of a certain government. But what they do - they punish people who actually don't have any influence or very small influence on what the government does.

VANEK SMITH: Branko says, in the case of a country like North Korea, the sanctions have had this kind of effect. Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, is of course still able to get anything he wants, and so are the North Korean elite. The rest of the population, though, has really suffered under his leadership, and sanctions have made that terrible situation even worse.

GARCIA: Yeah. And so Branko worries that something similar will happen in Iran, where people were already protesting a lack of drinking water and problems affording basic food staples, like eggs. Sanctions will likely drive down the value of the local currency and make food and other products even more expensive. But the leaders in Iran, the ones actually setting the policy that the U.S. opposes, they probably won't have trouble affording food or affording anything at all, really.

VANEK SMITH: Of course, there's also this idea that sanctions will make conditions in a country really bad and cause the population to revolt and overthrow the leadership or at least pressure leadership to change its policies. But that can backfire, says Branko.

MILANOVIC: Rather than creating a cleavage between the government and the people, they have the opposite effect of people have greater solidarity with the government because they're - everybody is being affected by them.

GARCIA: Dan Drezner says this happens quite a bit. The sanctioner becomes kind of like a common enemy to the people inside the country being sanctioned. Not only that, Dan says, but a country's leadership will often worry about an uprising and preemptively crack down on the population, which makes their lives even harder.

DREZNER: When you impose these kinds of sanctions, countries are much more likely to enact repressive measures that - obviously, it disproportionately affects the bottom half of the population. And also, sort of all the sort of human development metrics start to go south as a result of sanction impositions.

VANEK SMITH: Ultimately, Dan says, the best kind of sanction, the most effective kind of sanction, is often the sanction that never actually happens.

DREZNER: The ideal outcome - which is easy for me to say because I'm not in charge - is to threaten but not impose sanctions. Ideally, they will acquiesce without anything ever being made public, which is better for everyone because it's better for the target country because it's not seen like they're acquiescing in the middle of a crisis, which makes them look weak. And it also is better for the sending country in that you never actually had to impose the sanctions, which means you don't necessarily incur the cost of it.

VANEK SMITH: It's like a horror movie. It's better if you don't actually ever see the monster. You just sort of...

DREZNER: Exactly.

VANEK SMITH: Because once you see it...

DREZNER: Yes.

VANEK SMITH: ...You know, you can fight it off, things like that.

MILANOVIC: And it's more menacing when you don't see it.

**faster whisper:**
Our red line to Iran is do not develop a nuclear weapon.
That's a red line for us.
Responsible thing to do right now
is to keep putting diplomatic and economic pressure on them
to force them to do the right thing.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Caitlin Kenney.
And I'm Robert Smith.
Today is Tuesday, January 17th.
And that was Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.
You heard at the top, talking
about imposing economic sanctions against Iran.
Economic sanctions are a hot topic in the last few weeks.
And you can see why they're such an appealing idea for the U.S.
government.
Rather than try to go to war to stop Iran's nuclear program
to risk American lives, the U.S.
can block money from going into and out of the country.
And that makes life miserable for Iran.
And in theory, Iran's government
will give up their nuclear ambitions.
But our question today, do sanctions work?
Have sanctions ever really worked?
We have a deep read today with an economist
who has the answer.
But first, the Planet Money indicator
with her own Jacob Goldstein.
Today's Planet Money indicator, 3.1.
The interest rate on French 10-year government bonds,
it's 3.1%.
And I picked this for today's indicator
because, as you may have heard if you read the papers,
Standard & Poor's downgraded France's credit
rating on Friday from AAA.
That's the top rating, one notch down to AA plus.
This downgrade, it made big headlines over the weekend.
It plays into this whole collapse of Europe narrative.
But what really matters here, it's not what the headlines say,
it's not what Standard & Poor says,
it's what the people who lend money to the French government
actually do.
Well, I'll bite.
What do the people who lend money to the French government,
what do they think?
You know, they don't care.
They are completely ignoring this downgrade.
This indicator today, 3.1%, it's
almost exactly the same as the interest rate was
for France last week before the downgrade.
This sounds like exactly what happened
when S&P downgraded the US government debt last summer.
It is.
It is really the same story.
You know, big country loses its AAA status,
headlines play up some big decline and fall narrative,
and the people who really matter,
the ones who actually are lending money to governments,
they ignore the whole thing, go on as if it didn't happen.
Because they knew it was going to happen anyway.
Not only did they know the downgrade was going to happen,
but the really key thing with something like the US or France
is it's not like S&P has any special insight
or any secret documents they're looking at.
They know basically the same story as everybody else knows.
So it's just one more opinion.
Thanks, Jacob.
Thanks, guys.
OK, onto the effectiveness of sanctions.
It seems like there's always one country or another
that the United States or the United Nations
is imposing sanctions on.
And the reasons change, the regimes change,
but the idea behind it is always the same.
It's basically economic coercion.
The US can freeze another country's bank accounts.
It can stop trading with that country.
It can make other countries stop trading with that country.
Or it can deny foreign banks the ability
to access international finance.
In other words, the United States
can turn off the money tap and make sure
that other countries suffer.
And that's exactly what the US is trying
to do right now with Iran.
President Obama just signed a law
that punishes banks for doing business
with Iran's central bank.
The idea is that this will make
difficult for the country to sell its oil,
because people who buy oil from Iran, those payments
are processed through the central bank.
And the idea is if that money doesn't flow in for the oil,
that's going to hurt the government.
Today we're going to ask, do these kind
of economic sanctions, do they ever work?
Because we hear a lot about the sanctions
when they don't work.
We've had sanctions on Cuba for decades.
We had sanctions on Iraq for 13 years.
But you may remember that it took a war
to depose Saddam Hussein.
Now, Adam Davidson and I talked to an economist
who has studied this question.
But first, I wanted you to hear a little bit
about what life is like for the people under sanctions.
Now, Adam Davidson had a translator
when he was a reporter in Iraq.
His name is Amjad.
And we called him up.
And Amjad described what life was like
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the early 90s
and the United Nations imposed sanctions.
You know, people, once they heard in the news
that the UN is going to impose sanctions
on Iraq for invading Kuwait,
the people rushed into the stores,
stocking up piles of foods, you know, sacks of,
you know, rice, sugar, tea,
you know, whatever, like milk, powder milk,
you know, all that stuff that you need on a daily basis.
So, and that causes, like we used to buy,
you know, 50 kilos of rice
for 10 dinners.
And in one month, that 10 dinners
goes up to almost 50 dinners.
50 dinners, so that's five times the amount, yeah.
Yeah, five times the amount in almost like
in probably a month or so.
People had to sell their furniture
doing more than one work a day
just to manage to get enough money to buy just food.
I mean, forget about the clothes,
forget about the other things.
So they are just, you know, trying to have enough money
to get the food.
Now during this time when Amjad and everyone he knows
is selling all the possessions in their home,
Saddam Hussein, who the sanctions are supposed to punish,
he was going around building new palaces.
In fact, Amjad told us that he worked
on one of the construction sites
for the new palace at this time.
And he talked about how the walls inside
were covered in marble
and that you had to use this really expensive type of glue
to keep up the marble.
So even though no one was supposed to be dealing with them,
Saddam still had access to build these grand palaces
full of marble.
And this is the problem with sanctions
that we always hear about.
If a dictator who has plenty of money
and plenty of power and plenty of resources
doesn't care about the sanctions,
if that dictator can get around the sanctions,
if it hurts the citizens of a country
and not the government,
then why impose sanctions at all?
So Adam Davidson and I called up an economist,
Gary Huffbauer, he works at the Peterson Institute.
And he in fact wrote a book
called Economic Sanctions Reconsidered.
Huffbauer is also an expert
because he used to work for the U.S. Treasury
way back in the Carter administration.
In fact, he worked there during the hostage crisis
with Iran and was part of the original discussion
about imposing sanctions on Iran back then.
I was there at the very first inception
of the sanctions episode.
So can you tell us about what were the discussions
around sanctions?
How did it go from,
wow, they've kidnapped a bunch of Americans
and become sort of a rogue state to sanctions?
Was that just the obvious?
Well, I guess it seemed to be the obvious.
Remember at that time that Iran had a lot of money
in Western banks, U.S. banks,
but also British banks and French banks and so forth.
So it was relatively easy for the U.S.
to grab the money.
By that I mean freeze it.
And here you had this new revolutionary group
coming into power in Tehran.
And of course they wanted all the money they could get.
So they had a reason to talk.
They didn't talk very much
with the Carter administration,
but they did later talk with the Reagan administration
and we worked out this whole,
I should say the government worked out
this whole Hague process.
And you could say that was a relatively successful episode
in this long running set of problems with Iran.
So wait, I mean that sounds almost,
I mean blackmail might not be the right way to put it,
but we've got your money, you've got our people,
you don't get your money until we get our people.
It almost sounds like a mob kind of.
Oh absolutely, I mean it was.
I mean you're holding our people
and we're gonna hold your money.
And we're gonna work out
this fairly complicated legal process.
Does it always come down to two sets of people in a room,
one set going no, we have a military,
we should go in and take them out,
another set saying no, no, no, no, no, no.
We can do this through sanctions,
we can do this through money.
Is that the fundamental debate that happens
or something like this?
Well, you're close, but not spot on.
I mean if you go way back in history
to Woodrow Wilson, who is a big champion of sanctions,
his view and a view that prevailed in that era
was that sanctions were an alternative to war.
You could sanction a country and it would shape up
and that idea was proven wrong
when the League of Nations sanctioned Italy
over its invasion of what is now known as Ethiopia,
then known as Abyssinia.
Just quickly describe that.
What were the sanctions there and why did it fail?
Well, the League of Nations,
which the United States did not belong to remember
because the Senate didn't approve
our joining the League of Nations,
decided that Italian adventurism in Africa,
in Ethiopia was pretty awful and put on sanctions.
This was Britain and France principally,
but the Netherlands as well and a few other countries
and the U.S. kind of adhered to this
in a loose sort of way,
to get Mussolini to withdraw from Ethiopia
and Mussolini gave a stirring speech,
I can't recall the exact words,
but he says basically to sanctions
of an economic character we will reply
with our military strength and our national fortitude
and he ignored the sanctions
and Italy did not withdraw from Ethiopia.
Well, that was a sad episode
in the history of economic sanctions.
And not a ringing endorsement of the idea
that sanctions are an alternative to war.
Absolutely.
Now, Huffbauer and his coauthors
at the Peterson Institute looked at more than 200 episodes
of economic sanctions starting with World War I
and he found that a lot of the success of sanctions
depended on what exactly you're trying to accomplish.
It's one thing to get a country
to release some political prisoners
or perhaps improve human rights in general,
but a lot of these sanctions have much bigger goals
like overturning the government,
getting rid of a dictator.
Adam and I asked Huffbauer exactly how successful
have those kind of sanctions been?
In about 30% of the cases up to the year 2000,
regime change worked.
In other words, the leaders left or were overthrown.
Now, I've just looked at a tabulation
which is not in this book
that we've done of cases since the year 2000,
say the last decade or so.
And actually that figure holds up pretty well.
We're still getting a pretty good percentage of cases.
This actually surprises me
because when I think of the sort of
most obvious sanctions out there against Cuba
or against Iraq leading up to the war there.
Libya until we decided to lift them.
I think of all these like massive failures.
What, which ones are you referring to?
Like what's the most famous example of a success?
Yeah, well, I'm glad you put it that way
because the success cases are often the obscure ones
which probably very few people have heard of.
And I wanna-
They went on me.
Guinea in Africa.
There was a captain, Captain Kamara
who ran a military who'd done back in 2005
and the European Union said, you know, this is too much.
We want to return back to a democratic society
in this country and the European Union
gives a fair amount of money
given the size of the country to sustain it
in terms of various kinds of development projects.
And indeed in 2010, Captain Kamara went into exile.
This was after there was an assassination attempt
on him so there were other problems he had.
But he did leave, he went into exile
and there was an election of sorts
and democratic government restored.
Now who has heard of Guinea?
I do think only about 2% of Americans
could place Guinea on the African map.
This is the big example of success of sanctions.
And that's very characteristic of success.
Small-
I'd almost guarantee 2% is generous.
And then if you throw in which one's Guinea
and which one's Guinea-Bissau.
Yeah, we're up to the people who win quiz shows.
But that's very characteristic.
Panama, you could mention that.
Aristide, remember Aristide and Haiti.
We actually kind of put him into power
under the Clinton administration
but he turned out to be a little bit on the corrupt side
and authoritarian and so forth.
And under the Bush administration,
together with the Europeans,
we dislodged him from power and-
Wait, can I stop you on Haiti?
Because I have to say it's upsetting
to hear that talked about as a success.
I mean, I guess it's a success in the sense
that there's leadership we didn't want
and we put sanctions and then that leadership left.
But I spent a lot of last two years in Haiti
covering the efforts at economic development.
And there was sort of this miraculous thing happening
in the late 80s and early 90s,
which was the very early stages of industrialization.
The early stages of a middle-class emerging.
Haiti famously has a very tiny elite
which captures much of the wealth of the nation
and then a massive population that shares very,
very little and-
You're right, quite poor.
Every, I'd say every major industrialist,
every major business person I talked to,
everybody who had,
I just heard the same thing going on and on.
In 89, in 90, in 91, 92,
after we got rid of the dictator Baby Doc,
I was just beginning to build a factory
that was selling furniture to the US
or clothing to the US or whatever it might be.
And then the sanctions came and it killed everything.
Certainly the Baby Doc and his father Papa Doc
take a lot of the blame,
but I think the sanctions really,
really set the country back dramatically.
And importantly, they eliminated the growth
of this new middle-class
that could have become a real counterweight
to the dictatorial generals who were running the country.
And so it makes me sad to think
that could be on a success list of sanctions.
It seems like a clear example
of maybe one policy goal was achieved,
but at unbearable, horrible cost.
I really do take your point.
I mean, when we grade them,
we look at the goal which was sought
as far as we can make out by the leaders of the country
imposing the sanctions, the center country, its leaders.
Meaning what did President Clinton want to achieve
and did it? Correct.
Absolutely.
And you could say his National Security Council.
I mean, those are the folks.
But you're absolutely right.
And if you go to these regime change cases,
I'm sure you can find many of them
where after the regime was changed,
things did not get better for the people.
And so, and this is something I think the US government
hopefully considers more carefully now
than it might have back in that era.
Maybe not, and it's very hard to predict.
Even though you say that 30% of sanctions
were successful, it worries me what these 30% are.
These are small, poor countries that the United States,
the largest economy in the world, bears down upon.
And it seems like that once you get beyond a certain size,
it becomes too difficult to do these sanctions.
Is that right?
Oh, absolutely.
And we go into that size sort of thing,
but I think the big exceptions are countries
which are not necessarily giant countries,
but where there's an extremely strong
authoritarian leader, very good secret police
from the standpoint of maintaining the leadership,
which has some command of some resources,
maybe it's just the people,
and is able to withstand,
and those cases are the headline cases
that everyone knows.
So let me tick off a few of them.
Cuba, I mentioned, you've mentioned North Korea.
You could also go into Iraq,
where sanctions were extremely heavy,
and Saddam was able to withstand the sanctions for a,
you know, he withstood them until military forces came,
so that was not sanctions that dislodged him.
I feel like we need to step back for a moment,
because so far you've proven that
they're usually ineffective,
sanctions are usually ineffective.
We've talked about how it can hurt the middle class,
how it can strengthen the forces of darkness,
even if there is regime change,
it could bring in someone who is just as bad.
Make the pitch for me that sanctions should ever be used.
Well, I guess I would say that
if you've got a 30% success rate,
and that's our statistic.
For tiny, poor countries, yeah.
And only in very narrowly defining success, yeah.
Well, defining, yeah, you're right.
Not including all the things you would include.
That's pretty good as diplomacy goes, I mean, you know.
Diplomacy is never 100% batting average.
So I would put the success a little bit,
you know, I would characterize it
in a more optimistic way than you characterize it.
And there are some cases where I think everyone
would agree that the, you know,
what was achieved was a good thing.
The one really big case
where sanctions made a contribution,
I don't wanna say that was decisive,
but it was certainly important,
and that was South Africa.
It was a big country, apartheid ended,
sanctions played a role in that.
The internal politics in South Africa played
a larger role.
So I've tried to name a few cases where sanctions
I think in a broader characterization of success
would be characterized as successful.
Huffbauer in his research has a whole list of conditions
that help make sanctions work.
One, it clearly helps if the country you're targeting
is small, so you can push them around.
Two, it helps if the country has a lot
of trade relationships you can disrupt.
This makes sanctions more painful.
Number three, it helps if your goals
are reasonable and limited, as we talked about before.
It's maybe easier to get a few political prisoners free
than it is to get rid of a whole dictatorship.
Number four, sanctions, he says,
need to be imposed quickly.
And finally, five, especially in the case of Iran,
you want the sanctions to hurt them
more than the sanctions hurt the United States.
Using these criteria, Huffbauer says
that shutting down Iran's nuclear program
is gonna be tough.
But here's a difficult case.
Now, what's the argument for going ahead?
Well, the U.S. has never done anything
like what it's doing with Iran today.
We've tried to get other countries
not to deal with Iranian banks.
You could call them quasi-private banks,
and now we're going after the central bank.
And this is big stuff, and it is, I think,
having some effect in Iran in terms of the Iranians
having to think whether they can weather this through.
And I want to just mention one aspect
which I think is pretty clever
on the part of the U.S. government.
We're not blockading Iranian oil exports, right?
What we are doing is trying to discourage
through the financial mechanism
countries which are of the same mind
as the United States,
let's take Japan as an example, and Korea,
which are purchasers of Iranian oil,
from paying for it.
And so Iran is going to ship less oil to them.
Does that stand a better chance of success?
Better.
This is novel, and I think it does put the screws
on the leadership in Tehran,
whether it causes them to change course.
That's up in the air.
But the other part of the story is this.
If, eventually, the U.S. or Israel does resort
to a military strike,
there will obviously be a lot of criticism.
The backlash will be enormous.
But the criticism would be that much greater
if we had not gone to the maximum extent
on economic sanctions.
And that's clearly what the Obama administration
is doing, is going to the maximum extent.
And by that I mean we are pushing as hard
as our allies and countries we converse with,
that would be China, will allow us to go.
And so that comes back to the prelude to war.
As always, we'd like to hear what you think.
