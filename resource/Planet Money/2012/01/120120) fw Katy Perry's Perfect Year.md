Katy Perry killed it on the pop charts last year. She went No.1 five times. She was the most played artist on the radio. But the record industry is so weird, it's hard to know whether this kind of success translates into huge amounts of money for her label. How much did the label spend on Katy Perry? And how much did they make? On today's show, we try to figure it out.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOP OF THE POPS")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Yes, it's number one. It's "Top Of The Pops."

(SOUNDBITE OF THE KINKS SONG, "TOP OF THE POPS")

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Hello. Welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith.

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

I'm Zoe Chace. It's Friday, January 20. And that was The Kinks you heard at the top. Today in the podcast - how do record labels make money? We look at the biggest success out there.

SMITH: I'll give you a hint - she has a whipped cream bra.

CHACE: That would be Katy Perry. And did she actually make any money for her record label?

SMITH: We're going to do that podcast after our PLANET MONEY Indicator with Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY Indicator - 352,000. Three hundred fifty-two thousand Americans filed for unemployment insurance for the first time last week. And I'm just going to get right out in front of this and say, this is a very promising number.

SMITH: You know, I'm glad you brought this up because I'm always a little befuddled when I hear this number because I hear it out there and I don't know what to judge it by. So I don't know if it's getting better. I don't know if it's getting worse. I don't know. Is that a normal amount - 352,000?

GOLDSTEIN: It's not quite as good as say great times, but it's not bad. And so let's just do some context here, right? In really good economic times, when unemployment is very low, this number, this weekly initial claims for unemployment, it's around 300,000. This a lot of people filing for unemployment.

SMITH: It's the churn.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. It's the churn because every week hundreds of thousands of people are also getting new jobs, right? So we're at 350,000 now - not ideal, but we were over 400,000 for a long time. In the worst part of the recession, we were up above 600,000. So 350,000 - not only is it getting better, it's getting pretty close to good.

SMITH: Well, I got to stop you there because that is as good as it gets with you, Jacob. Thank you.

CHACE: Thanks, Jacob,

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks guys.

CHACE: Onto the podcast. Before we turn to economics, let's just spend a moment appreciating the art - the art of the top 40 song.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CALIFORNIA GURLS")

SNOOP DOGG: Greetings, loved ones. Let's take a journey.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TEENAGE DREAM")

KATY PERRY: (Singing) You make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "FIREWORK")

PERRY: (Singing) Oh, oh, oh. You're going to leave them fallin' down...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "E.T.")

PERRY: (Singing) Extraterrestrial...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LAST FRIDAY NIGHT")

PERRY: (Singing) Do it all again...

CHACE: That, of course, is Katy Perry, and she had a great year last year. I mean, she was on the radio all the time. She went to No. 1 five times off one album. She's the first person that's done it since Michael Jackson. Like, that was quite a successful year.

SMITH: And she is this perfect experiment, really, for looking at the economic of the record business, which is just simply, if you cannot make money off of Katy Perry with the kind of year she had, if you can't make money off her, then you are doomed. You will never be able to make money. So today, we are going to look at Katy Perry, and we're going to look at some numbers.

CHACE: So knowing what I know about the music industry, knowing what we all know, which is basically that it's in the crapper, I was like, let me just ask the record label, did you guys make a profit? So I walked over there. It's in Manhattan. It's, like, 20 blocks away. She's on Capitol. It's under EMI. And I met Greg Thompson, a record executive.

I know it was an expensive record and pushing out the singles was expensive. Did you guys end up in the black? Did you recoup?

GREG THOMPSON: As far as I know, yes.

SMITH: Wait, I want you to stop this right here because this is crazy. He says, as far as I know. If you would ask the record exec for Michael Jackson, who - Katy Perry tied his record. If you'd asked that record executive, that guy was bathing in champagne. He had boatloads of money coming in. And now these days, you ask the record exec at Katy Perry's label and he's like, as far as I know.

CHACE: Yeah I know, it's crazy.

How do you not know?

THOMPSON: No, I believe we did.

CHACE: Look, he's answering like this for two reasons. One, this is the record industry. Of course, they're secretive about the numbers and the pricing. Like, that makes sense. But also, Robert, it's actually very, very complicated to figure out how these record labels are making money, even off a superstar like that. So we're just going to do this on our own, right now.

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: OK. He's not going to lay it out for us. We're just going to figure it out.

SMITH: OK. Now there is one thing that we do know because it is public information - that is how many records and how many songs Katy Perry sold. Now, I have the numbers here. Katy Perry sold two million albums, which is pretty good, and 24 million individual songs, the kind you download on iTunes for 99 cents. So if you do the calculations, just the top-of-the-head calculations, that comes out to $44 million, which is huge.

CHACE: Yes, it is. But the record label doesn't get $44 million.

SMITH: Yeah. I understand that.

CHACE: OK. We're going to start with the 44 million and then we're just going to start taking money away.

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: OK. Let's do a little demonstration here. All right, here's how we're going to play it. You're going to be the record label.

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: OK. And then let's just say Caitlin, our producer, she bought a Katy Perry track on iTunes.

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: OK. So here is one song's worth of change.

SMITH: Ninety-nine cents on iTunes - look at that. OK.

CHACE: OK. Perfect. So Robert.

SMITH: Yes.

CHACE: You're the record label.

SMITH: OK. Let me take all my 99 cents.

CHACE: Yeah. Remember I said iTunes.

SMITH: Oh, yeah.

CHACE: OK. So Apple, you know, takes about a 30 percent cut, so give me like 30.

SMITH: There's 30 of them - more or less - sure.

CHACE: You know, Apple is pretty fastidious about these kinds of things, but I'll just take it.

SMITH: OK, so 70 cents is leftover.

CHACE: No. That's not how it works. Give me - I need the artist royalty now as well. So that would be about - say Katy Perry has a 15 percent royalty. Give me 15 cents.

SMITH: OK. Now that seems totally fair. Katy Perry sang it. She needs to have her eyebrows done and...

CHACE: Coconut water.

SMITH: Yeah, coconut water. So...

CHACE: Right. And also about 30 cents more goes to the song writers - right? - you know, the people that wrote lines like this.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY")

PERRY: (Singing) The summer after high school when we first met, we make out in your Mustang to Radiohead. And on my...

SMITH: OK. The Mustang and the Radiohead is a nice touch.

CHACE: No, it's a good line.

SMITH: They deserve the money.

CHACE: OK. And, you know, Katy Perry gets a little bit of that too because she wrote on that song as well.

SMITH: You know, when I hear these big stars say that they wrote on the songs, I just assume - and maybe this is terrible - but I assume they write stuff like this part of the song.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY")

PERRY: (Singing) The one, the one, the one...

CHACE: It doesn't say who wrote what. OK. Don't be a hater about it.

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: If her name is on as a writer, she gets what are called publishing rights.

SMITH: OK. I'm just being stingy because I'm playing the label here. So basically...

CHACE: Right.

SMITH: ...What you have left me with off of that 99 cent song is about 25 cents on the dollar.

CHACE: That's about right.

SMITH: Which does not sound - that doesn't sound bad to me. Twenty-five cents on the dollar works out - if we go back to the numbers of albums and singles that we sold - to about $10 million. So that's not bad.

CHACE: Yeah. Ten million dollars - that's a nice number. But what about the costs?

SMITH: Ah, yes.

CHACE: Right. So I asked Katy Perry's label about that - EMI. This is what they said.

THOMPSON: We invested substantially to make a great record.

SMITH: In record industry speak - invested substantially sounds like this is going to cost me a lot of money, a lot of my 25 cents here.

CHACE: Yes, it will. You have correctly understood record-label speak. We're just going to visit a couple costs. And to help me out with this, I called an entertainment lawyer, Andy Tavel.

ANDY TAVEL: I mean, I've represented a number of superstars over the years.

CHACE: Such as?

TAVEL: From LL Cool J to Mary J. Blige to The Cure.

CHACE: It's OK. I get the idea.

TAVEL: From Arrested Development...

CHACE: Remember them?

TAVEL: Gwar.

SMITH: (Laughter) Gwar? Do you know who Gwar is?

CHACE: No, why are you laughing?

SMITH: Gwar is this band of guys who dress up like space aliens.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: And they basically spew liquids all over the people at the concerts.

CHACE: OK, well, Gwar needs a lawyer...

SMITH: I guess Gwar needs a lawyer.

CHACE: ...And that guy is Andy Tavel.

SMITH: All right. I totally trust this guy. What does he have to say about Katy Perry?

CHACE: All right. The first expense would be the album itself, right? How much did it cost to record "Teenage Dream?"

THOMPSON: $1.5 million, perhaps even up to $2 million.

CHACE: Why so expensive, right? Well, look at this track.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CALIFORNIA GURLS")

SNOOP DOGG: Greetings, loved ones. Let's take a journey.

CHACE: That's Snoop Dogg. He's pricy. And there's the production underneath.

(SOUNDBITE OF KATY PERRY SONG, "CALIFORNIA GURLS")

CHACE: That's the sound of the top producers in the business, Dr. Luke and Max Martin.

SMITH: OK. So I can see how that kind of talent adds up. What else is going to cost me here?

CHACE: Well, remember a hit song is not a hit song until it's on the radio.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY")

PERRY: (Singing) Get away.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: New York's new hit music channel.

COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: 92.3 Now.

CHACE: Spots on top 40 radio are very competitive. So I went downtown. I went to 92.3. And I met up with the program director there, Rob Wagman. And remember, five of Katy Perry's songs were in the top spot last year. And that means that they played something like...

ROB WAGMAN: Nineteen times a day, which is quite ridiculous, but that's the strategy of programming.

CHACE: And when I walked into Rob's office, there was this giant painting of Katy Perry hanging on the wall.

SMITH: Wait a minute. Did - and the label had to pay for that?

CHACE: Yeah. The label sent it to him. She's - you know, it's the album cover. She's naked wrapped in cotton candy. And it's like a huge painting.

SMITH: They must've sent out hundreds of these. I must've sent out - if I'm being the record company, this must've cost me.

CHACE: Yeah. They hired painters. They sent out paintings.

WAGMAN: They usually send that out before the next single.

CHACE: The labels spend a lot of money on independent promoters is the term. And independent promoters basically sell the songs to radio. They do it however they can - in sketchy ways, in totally above-board ways. And the top 40 stations, they test the records. And they test the records. And they play the records if the songs test well. So getting your song played on the radio is expensive and marketing your song is expensive.

SMITH: OK. OK. OK. So if I'm playing the record company here, I had $10 million, what is all this stuff going to cost me - the oil paintings, the promotion? What is this going to cost me out of my profits?

CHACE: Right. It's too complicated to get into sort of who's assuming what cost. But if you sort of add it up, net it out, I'm going to say it costs you at least $2 million. So we're going to pull that $2 million away as well.

SMITH: OK. Let me give you some more of those pennies. So at this point, it looks like I can say as a record company, I have made $8 million. I started out - $44 million came in, and now I have $8 million.

CHACE: Eight million dollars, yeah?

(LAUGHTER)

CHACE: What's the problem here?

SMITH: I'm not going to say that $8 million isn't a lot of money. But as a business for the giant record company conglomerate, this does not sound like a hugely successful product. And we have to remember we're talking about Katy Perry, someone who is sort of a once-in-a-generation artist who did this amazing thing, who had all these hits...

CHACE: I know. You want hits in this business, right? You got hits. This is hits.

SMITH: This is exactly what they dream about. When they plan on the best-possible scenario, Katy Perry is that scenario.

CHACE: Right.

SMITH: And yet, at the end of the day, the EMI execs have to go into some boardroom and say oh, we made $8 million - doesn't sound good. There's got to be another way that record companies can get some more of this money.

CHACE: I know. I mean, this is the thing that's funny about it. OK. First of all, yes, there is a little bit more money that you can squeeze out of these songs, right...

SMITH: OK.

CHACE: ...When they show up in movie trailers commercials. Those are licensing. The record label gets some of that. But I mean, we said the song plays 19 times a day on the radio, right? The record label doesn't get that. Katy Perry went on tour. She toured all summer. It was a really successful tour. She did great. She brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue. The record label doesn't get any of that.

SMITH: And the merchandising, the Katy Perry T-shirts and little bows and...

CHACE: No, the record label doesn't get any of that.

SMITH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

CHACE: It's not - because remember, they used to actually make money off music sales, right? People used to actually go buy records. They used to really make a lot of money there. And this is not news, what we're talking about, to the record labels, right? They have been worried about this since the Internet showed up.

SMITH: (Laughter).

CHACE: OK. They've been planning for what to do when people stopped buying music. And so what they've done is they've developed this new kind of deal. It's a record deal, but it's structured really differently than the record deal that Katy Perry's on.

SMITH: Ah, so the next time there's a Katy Perry or someone like her...

CHACE: Right.

SMITH: ...There are ways that record companies can make even more money.

CHACE: Yeah. So to explain this, I talked to this guy Glenn Nordlinger. And he's the business manager of groups like the Jonas Brothers. He does negotiations with these new kind of record deals all the time.

GLENN NORDLINGER: The interesting aspect of the music industry that everybody's completely aware of is there aren't that many industries in this world where you develop a product, whether it's a cereal, a toothpaste or a great record - you spend a lot of money researching it, developing it and then marketing it. And then you walk away from virtually every potential revenue stream that that product generates other than retail sales.

CHACE: They didn't used to care about the touring revenue, the merchandising revenue because they made so much money selling records.

SMITH: Yeah. Before the Internet, sure. Like, why would you care about these little tiny things on the side when basically you had this easy way to make money?

CHACE: Yeah.

SMITH: Just pawning off albums and CDs.

CHACE: Yeah. And the profits of an artists, Nordlinger says, they used to break down like this. Record sales, publishing - those are those songwriters' rights - the touring revenue and then the merchandise revenue. That was how it used to be. But today, in the Internet age when people can get their music whenever they want, however they want it, it's the exact opposite revenue structure. You've heard of Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga.

SMITH: I have daughters.

CHACE: You're also a fan. Don't lie to me.

SMITH: (Laughter) True.

NORDLINGER: They may do a $100 million, $150 million, $200 million of tour revenue. Somebody like Justin Bieber would then do about $30 million to $50 million in merch.

SMITH: This is amazing figures that he's giving here because we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was that pretend record company, I made $8 million.

CHACE: I know. I see dollar signs in your eyes.

SMITH: I'm ready.

CHACE: I mean, he says artists like these, they do turn $3 million to $4 million in record sales.

NORDLINGER: Maybe $6 million, maybe $7 million, but who cares? It's pennies relative to the touring revenue that's going to be generated today.

CHACE: So the record labels have figured out how to get a piece of all these revenue sources. And it's called the 360 deal. The 360 deal means, of course, that the record label gets a little piece of everything the artist does. So they get a piece of the tour. They get a piece of the commercial. They get a piece of the merchandising, like, you know, the Justin Bieber singing toothbrush, whatever. They get some of that. They get the songwriting money that I told you the label was cut out of before. They get it.

SMITH: So in this scenario, if a record label is getting a little bit of everything, the record sales are basically the last thing they worry about.

CHACE: Yeah. Music sales - that's the least significant part of what they do.

SMITH: Well, to take this back to Katy Perry - the subject of our podcast - what the heck was EMI thinking? Like, why did they bank everything on album sales when they should've had this new kind of 360 deal?

CHACE: I mean, this is the way the record business has been structured for decades. It's very hard to undo it. And I don't know why EMI couldn't get a 360 deal with Katy Perry. When I asked people, they just shrugged and told me she probably has a good lawyer.

SMITH: So the moral of this exercise for me is that next time we do this, I don't want to play the record company. I want to play Katy Perry because, No. 1, I get all the money, and, No. 2, I get to work on my next album and make an even better deal for myself. She's clearly the winner in all of this, but the record label - what can we say about EMI?

CHACE: Well, EMI - they couldn't be doing worse. Like, they're shutting their doors. They're getting broken up and sold off to the last remaining record labels standing. There's only three major music labels left here. There's Universal Music Group. There's Warner. And there's Sony. And you wouldn't even maybe call them record labels at this point. A better word for these companies might just be promotional conglomerates around artists since the last thing they do is sell music.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOP OF THE POPS")

THE KINKS: (Singing) Now my record's up to number three...

CHACE: We love hearing from you, so send us an email at planetmoney@npr.org.

SMITH: And when you're done listening to PLANET MONEY, go on over to the This American Life podcast because this week is a special collaboration between PLANET MONEY and This American Life. It's a show all about the crisis in Europe. Everything you wanted to know about the horror show that is the European economy, you will learn on This American Life. That's this week also on public radio stations.

CHACE: I'm Zoe Chace.

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Thanks for listening.

THE KINKS: (Singing) It's strange how people want you when your record's high. When it drops down, they just pass you by. Now my agent called me on the telephone - said son, your record's just got to number one.

**faster whisper:**
Yes, it's number one. It's top of the pops
Hello, welcome to Planet Money. I'm Robert Smith. I'm Zoe chase
It's Friday January 20th, and that was the kinks you heard at the top today in the podcast
How do record labels make money? We look at the biggest success out there. I'll give you a hint
She has a whipped cream bra that would be Katy Perry and did she actually make any money for her record label?
We're gonna do that podcast after our planet money indicator with Jacob Goldstein today's planet money indicator
352,000
352,000 Americans filed for unemployment insurance for the first time last week
And I'm just gonna get right out in front of this and say this is a very promising number
you know, I'm glad you brought this up because I'm always a little befuddled when I hear this number because I
Hear it out there and I don't know what to judge it by so I don't know if it's getting better
I don't know if it's getting worse. I don't know. Is that a normal amount 352,000?
It's not quite as good as say great times, but it's not bad
And and so let's just do some context here right in in really good economic times when unemployment is very low
This number this weekly initial claims for unemployment. It's around 300,000
And this is a lot of people filing for unemployment every week
Right, it's the turn because every week hundreds of thousands of people are also getting new jobs, right?
So we're at three hundred and fifty thousand now not ideal
But we were over four hundred thousand for a long time in the worst part of the recession. We were up above six hundred thousand
So three hundred and fifty thousand not only is it getting better. It's getting pretty close to good. Oh
Well, I gotta stop you there because that is as good as it gets with you. Jacob. Thank you. Thanks, Jacob
Thanks guys onto the podcast before we turn to economics
Let's just spend a moment appreciating the arts the art of the top 40 song greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey
That of course is Katy Perry and she had a great year last year
I mean she was on the radio all the time. She went to number one five times off one album
She's the first person that's done that since Michael Jackson. Like that was quite a successful year and she is this perfect
experiment really for looking at the economics of the record business
Which is just simply if you cannot make money off of Katy Perry with the kind of year
She had if you can't make money off for her, then you are doomed
You will never be able to make money
So today we are going to look at Katy Perry and we're gonna look at some numbers
So knowing what I know about the music industry knowing what we all know, which is basically that it's in the crapper
I was like, let me just ask the record label. Did you guys make a profit? So I walked over there?
It's in Manhattan. It's like 20 blocks away. She's on Capitol
It's under EMI and I met Greg Thompson a record executive

He had boatloads of money coming in and now these days you ask the record exec at Katy Perry's label
And he's like as far as I know. Yeah, I know it's crazy. How do you not know?
No, I believe we did look he's answering like this for two reasons one
This is the record industry
Of course, they're secretive about the numbers and the pricing like that makes sense. But also Robert
It's actually very very complicated to figure out how these record labels are making money even off a superstar like that
So we're just gonna do this on our own right now. Okay. Okay. He's not gonna lay it out for us
We're just gonna figure it out. Okay
now there is one thing that we do know because it's public information that is how many
Records and how many songs Katy Perry sold now?
I have the numbers here Katy Perry sold 2 million albums, which is pretty good and
24 million individual songs can you download on iTunes for 99 cents?
So if you do the calculations just the top-of-the-head calculations that comes out to
44 million dollars, which is huge. Yes, it is but the record label doesn't get 44 million dollars
Yeah, I understand. Okay, we're gonna start with the 44 million and then we're just gonna start taking money away. Okay
Let's do a little demonstration here. All right. Here's how here's how we're gonna play it. You're gonna be the record label
Okay, okay, and then let's just say
Caitlin our producer she bought a Katy Perry track on iTunes. Okay. Okay, so
here is
One song's worth of change 99 cents on iTunes. Look at that. Okay. Okay, perfect
So Robert, yes, you're the record label. Okay, let me take all my 996
Yeah, remember I said iTunes, okay, so Apple, you know takes about a 30% cut so give me like 30 there's 30 of them
Apple is pretty fastidious about
Okay, so
70 cents is left over. No, that's not how it works. Give me I need the artist royalty now as well
So that would be about say Katy Perry is a 15% royalty. Give me 15 cents
Okay now the that seems totally fair Katy Perry sang it mm-hmm
She needs to have her eyebrows done and coconut water. Yeah coconut water. So
Right and also about 30 cents more
Goes to the songwriters, right? You know the people that wrote lines like this
Okay
The Mustang and the radiohead is a nice time. It's a good line. They deserve the money. Okay
and you know, Katy Perry gets a little bit of that too because she
She wrote on that
You know when I hear these big stars say that they wrote on the songs
I just assume and I mean this is terrible, but I just assume they write stuff like this part of the song
It doesn't say who wrote what okay, don't be a hater about it if her name is on as a writer
She gets what are called publishing rights? Okay. I'm just being stingy because I'm playing the label here
So basically what you have left me with off of that 99 cent song is about 25 cents on the dollar
Which which does not sound does that doesn't sound bad to me 25 cents on the dollar works out if we go back
To the numbers of albums and singles that we sold to about 10 million dollars. So that's not bad
Yeah, ten million dollars that's a nice number, but what about the cost?
Yes, right. So I asked Katy Perry's label about that EMI. This is what they said we
Invested substantially to make a great record in record industry speak invested substantially
Sounds like this is gonna cost me a lot of money a lot of my 25 cents here
Yes, it will you have correctly understood record label speak
We're just gonna visit a couple costs and to help me out with this
I called an entertainment lawyer Andy Tabble. I
Mean, I've represented a number of superstars over the years
Cool J to Mary J. Blige to the cure
Remember them goire
Goire
Do you know goire's?
Why are you laughing goire is this band of guys who dress up like space aliens and and they basically spew liquids all
Over the all of the people. Hey, well goire needs a lawyer
All right, I totally trust this guy what does he have to say about Katy Perry?
All right. The first expense would be the album itself, right? How much did it cost to record Teenage Dream?
1.5 million perhaps even up to 2 million. Why so expensive right? We'll look at this track
Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey
That's Snoop Dogg. He's pricey and there's the production underneath
That's the sound of the top producers in the business. Dr. Luke and Max Martin
Okay, so I can I can see how that kind of talent adds up. What else?
What else is gonna cost me here? Well, remember hit song is not a hit song until it's on the radio
Spots on top 40 radio are very competitive. So I went downtown
I went to 92 3 and I met up with the program director there Rob Wagman and remember
Five of Katy Perry's songs were in the top spot last year and that means that they played something like
19 times a day which is quite ridiculous
But that's the strategy of programming and when I walked into Rob's office
There was this giant painting of Katy Perry hanging on the wall women and the label had to pay for that
Yeah, the label sent it to him. She's you know, it's an album cover
She's naked wrapped in cotton candy and it's like a huge painting. They must have sent out hundreds of these
I must have set out if I'm being the record company. This must have cost me
Yeah, they hired painters. They sent out paintings
They usually send that out before the next single the label spend a lot of money on
Independent promoters is the term and independent promoters basically sell the songs to radio
they do it however they can in
Sketchy ways and totally above boardways and the top 40 stations
They test the records and they test the records and they play the records if the songs test well
So getting your song played on the radio is expensive and marketing your song is expensive. Okay, okay
Okay. Okay. So if I'm playing the record company here, I
Had ten million dollars. Mm-hmm. What is all this stuff gonna cost me the oil paintings the promotion?
What is this gonna cost me out of my profits, right?
It's too complicated to get into sort of who's assuming what cost but if you if you sort of add it up
Net it out. I'm gonna say it costs you at least two million dollars
So we're gonna pull that two million dollars away. Let me give you some more of those pennies
So at this point, it looks like I can say as a record company, I have made eight million dollars
I started out with 44 million came in and now I have eight million dollars eight million dollars. Yeah
What's the problem
here
I'm not gonna say the eight million dollars isn't a lot of money
But as a business for a giant record company conglomerate
This does not sound like a hugely successful product and and we have to remember talking about Katy Perry
Someone who is sort of a once-in-a-generation artist who did this amazing thing who had all these kids
I know you want hits in this business, right? You got hits
This is exactly what they dream about when they plan on the best possible scenario
Katy Perry is that scenario right and yet at the end of the day the EMI execs have to go into some boardroom
We made eight million dollars
Doesn't sound good. There's got to be another way that record companies could get some more of this money
I know I mean this is the thing that's funny about it. Okay, first of all, yes
There is a little bit more money that you can squeeze out of these songs
Right when they show up in movie trailers commercials, those are licensing the record label gets some of that
But I mean we said the song plays 19 times a day on the radio, right?
The record label doesn't get that Katy Perry went on tour. She toured all summer
It was a really successful tour. She did great
She brought in tens of millions of dollars in revenue
The record label doesn't get any of that and the merchandising that Katy Perry t-shirts and little little bows and the record label doesn't get
Any yeah, that's not because remember they used to actually make money off music sales, right?
People used to actually go buy records
They used to really make a lot of money there and this is not news what we're talking about to the record labels
Right. They've been worried about this since the Internet showed up
Okay, they've been planning for what to do when people stopped buying music
And so what they've done is they've developed this new kind of deal
It's a record deal, but it's structured really differently than the record deal that Katy Perry's on
Ah, so next time there's a Katy Perry or someone like her, right?
There are ways that record companies can make even more money. Yeah, so to explain this I talked to this guy Glenn
Norlinger and he's the business manager of groups like the Jonas Brothers
He does negotiations with these new kind of record deals all the time the
Interesting aspect of the music industry that everybody's completely aware of is there aren't that many
Industries in this world where you develop a product whether it's a cereal a toothpaste
Or a great record you spend a lot of money
Researching it developing it and then marketing it
And then you walk away from virtually every potential revenue stream that that product
Generates other than retail sales
They didn't used to care about the touring revenue the merchandising revenue because they made so much money selling records
Yeah before the Internet sure like why would you care about these little tiny things on the side?
When basically you had this easy way to make money. Yeah, just punting off albums and CDs
Yeah, and the profits of an artist Norlinger says they used to break down like this record sales
Publishing those are those songwriters rights the touring revenue and then the merchandise revenue
That was how it used to be but today in the internet age when people can get their music whenever they want however
They want it. It's the exact opposite revenue structure. You've heard of Justin Bieber Lady Gaga. I have daughters
You're also a fan. Don't lie to me
They may do a hundred million
150 200 million dollars of
Tour revenue
Somebody like Justin Bieber would then do about 30 to 50 million in merch
this is
Amazing figures that he's giving here because we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars when I was that pretend record company
I made eight million dollars. I know I see dollar signs in your eyes. I'm ready I
Mean he says artists like these they do turn three to four million in record sales
Maybe six maybe seven, but who cares?
It's pennies
Relative to the touring revenue that's going to be generated today
So the record labels have figured out how to get a piece of all these revenue sources
And it's called the 360 deal the 360 deal means of course that the record label gets a little piece of everything
The artist does so they get a piece of the tour they get a piece of the commercial
They get a piece of the merchandising like you know the Justin Bieber singing toothbrush
Whatever they get some of that they get the songwriting money that I told you the label was cut out of before they
Get it so in this scenario if a record label is getting a little bit of everything
The record sales are basically the last thing they worry about yeah music sales
That's the least significant part of what they do well to take this back to Katy Perry the subject of our podcast
What the heck was EMI thinking like why did they bank everything on album sales when they should have had this new?
Kind of 360 deal. I mean this is the way the record business has been structured for decades
It's very hard to undo it
And I don't know why EMI couldn't get a 360 deal with Katy Perry when I asked people
They just shrugged and told me she probably has a good lawyer
So the moral of this exercise for me is that next time we do this. I don't want to play the record company
I want to play Katy Perry because number one I get all the money and number two I
Get to work on my next album and make an even better deal for myself. She's clearly the winner in all of this
But the record label what can we say about EMI?
Well EMI they couldn't be doing worse like they're shutting their doors
They're getting broken up and sold off to the last remaining record label standing
There's only three major music labels left here. There's Universal Music Group
There's Warner and there's Sony and you wouldn't even maybe call them
Record labels at this point a better word for these companies might just be promotional conglomerates around artists
Since the last thing they do is sell music
