(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "BARBARIANS AT THE GATE")

DAVID RASCHE: (As Ted Forstmann) Ross, don't you see this is our last chance? The bastards are at the city gates. Let's stand at the bridge together. Let's stand at the bridge and push the barbarians back.

JAMES GARNER: (As F. Ross Johnson) Right. Just give me a minute.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA")

CHARLIE DANIELS BAND: (Singing) The devil went down to Georgia. He was looking for a soul to steal. He was in a bind because he was way behind, and he was willing to make a deal, when he came across this young man sawing on the fiddle and playing it hot. And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said, boy, let me tell you what.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

I'm Zoe Chace. Today is Tuesday, February 28, and that was a clip from the made-for-TV movie "Barbarians At The Gate." It's the classic movie about private equity. And in that scene, the head of RJR Nabisco is sweating in his office. A private equity firm is coming to buy his company. Another buyout firm is urging him to resist.

KESTENBAUM: Today is our second podcast on private equity firms. Are they good, evil, somewhere in between? We've been focusing on examples from Mitt Romney's firm, Bain Capital, since that's in the news. Last time, we walked you through an investment in a company that made those yellow legal pads. That deal went bust. Today, we look at an investment that went well.

CHACE: And we step back and say, OK, private equity - what are we supposed to make of it?

KESTENBAUM: First, the indicator from Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - six. It has been almost six years since home prices started falling, and they are still falling.

KESTENBAUM: That's not news if it's still falling.

GOLDSTEIN: Six years, man.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) All right.

GOLDSTEIN: You're not going to give me six years? That's a great indicator. The Case-Shiller index came out today. And as of December, it said, home prices hit a new post-bubble low.

KESTENBAUM: So we've talked about before on the podcast how the housing market is different from, say, the stock market - right? - where people can buy and sell instantly. I want to sell a stock. Whoa, it just happened. You know, I want to sell a house. You know, that could take a longer time, right? And you add to that the fact that we've had this huge bubble followed by a huge wave of foreclosures - millions of people underwater on their mortgages - so it makes sense that something like this is just going to take a really long time. But, I mean, six years is a really long time. When's it going to end?

GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't know, is the short answer. But there are ways to think this through that are useful. You know, I mean, first, you can say, well, there are still millions of people underwater on their mortgages. There are millions more foreclosures that are likely to happen in the next couple years. So it's not like all of a sudden, next month, everything's going to be great all of a sudden. But that said, there are signs that the housing market is slowly sort of grinding back to normal - in particular, that glut of homes on the market that I kept talking about - it was, like, a go-to indicator for me last year - that glut has basically disappeared. We're back to a kind of normal relation between supply and demand in the housing market. So that is a sign that it's kind of normalizing.

It's also the case that, yeah, prices are falling. They were down about 4 percent last year. But they're not, like, falling through the floor, like they were at the beginning of the bust. They're just kind of bumping along the bottom, maybe getting a little lower. And then finally, you know, if you look really big-picture, the whole economy is clearly starting to get better. Maybe most importantly, the number of new jobs the economy is adding is growing every month. So all these things together suggest, you know, the housing bust is not going to go on forever, and the market is starting to get back to normal.

CHACE: Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

CHACE: Onto the podcast and more good times with Bain Capital, Mitt Romney's private equity firm. On our last podcast, if you didn't hear it, it featured an investment that ended like this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

CHACE: When you look back at your legacy there at the company that you helped to build, what is the value added? Since the company did end up going bankrupt and breaking off into pieces, is there a lasting value to what happened?

RUSSELL GARD: No. My opinion - no, there's no lasting value. It was - no - no - no lasting value.

KESTENBAUM: The story was that Bain Capital came in and bought this company called Ampad that made legal pads - those yellow pads of paper. They wanted to build a paper empire, so they took out a whole bunch of loans. They bought a bunch of other companies - file folder companies, an envelope company, printer paper company. But eight years after the investment, the new company, American Pad & Paper, was broken into pieces in bankruptcy court.

CHACE: The investment that we're going to look at today - it sounds very different.

TOM STEINER: One of those times in your business career when things were going great, times kept getting better and better...

CHACE: This is Tom Steiner (ph). He was an executive at one of the companies that was bought by Mitt Romney's firm Bain Capital in the 1990s. And he's actually nostalgic for the days that Bain was running the company.

STEINER: It was fun because people trusted each other, you know, being rewarded very nicely for their effort.

KESTENBAUM: This time, Bain was not buying a legal pad company in the hopes of making a paper empire. This time, the business was a contact lens company called Wesley Jessen. And in the mid-'90s, at the time, it was not doing very well.

BILL FLYNN: Well, I was in the finance area of Wesley Jessen. And we were not a very profitable company at all.

CHACE: This is Bill Flynn. He worked at the contact lens company Wesley Jessen at the time. And what happened was Bain saw this company, and they thought the business could be doing a lot better. This is what private equity is supposed to do. They find companies like this - companies that are foundering - and they fix them up. So they start with money from outside investors, pension funds, endowments and then borrow a lot of money from the bank. They then take that money and buy companies. They basically renovate the companies. They try to make them better. And once they've done that, they sell them off. They pay off the debt. They pay back their investors. And sometimes they pay back their investors a lot.

KESTENBAUM: Wesley Jessen didn't just make contact lenses. They made colored contact lenses. And the business was kind of getting lost. Wesley Jessen was part of a bigger company, Schering-Plough. And the colored contact lens business just wasn't competing very well. Disposable contact lenses were popular, but they weren't making disposables. They were making the old, extended-wear kind. So Bain Capital thought there was room for improvement.

CHACE: And color contacts - like, I've never worn them, but I've always thought they're totally awesome. I love them. Like, if you have a green dress, then you just get green eyes to go with it. It's nice.

KESTENBAUM: Zoe, you were not alone. They weren't very profitable, but some people were buying them - some people you might've heard of.

(SOUNDBITE OF MICHAEL JACKSON SONG, "THRILLER")

CHACE: Michael Jackson wore Wesley Jessen contacts in the "Thriller" video. Remember, you can see those yellow eyes.

(SOUNDBITE OF MICHAEL JACKSON SONG, "THRILLER")

CHACE: Bain thought these color contacts - done right, they could be big. Wesley Jessen had a patent. And their patent on color contacts was so broad, one of the executives told me, that they controlled 80 percent of the world market on color contacts.

KESTENBAUM: So Bain Capital decides this is going to be its next big private equity deal. It's going to buy the colored contact lens business and make it profitable. Here's Bill Flynn again.

FLYNN: Bain came in and gave us a clean slate.

CHACE: Bain's investment was similar to the last deal we looked at. To buy the company, you needed almost $50 million. And this is the way private equity works. You don't have to put all that money up. Bain puts in about $6 1/2 million and borrows the rest. This, you may remember, is what Bain did with Ampad. It's the classic private equity move.

KESTENBAUM: And now they're in that classic private equity position. They have to turn a company around, a company that now has a whole bunch of debt.

CHACE: The very first and probably most important thing Bain did is they hired this one guy.

STEINER: The primary contribution that they made was bringing in a new CEO by the name of Kevin Ryan.

FLYNN: He worked harder than almost everybody in the company.

JOE COLLINS: He was very - he was an ethical, honest guy.

FLYNN: It was an attitude.

STEINER: Through his intelligence and charisma...

FLYNN: He could get people to do things they had not normally done.

CHACE: Unanimous. That was Tom Steiner, Bill Flynn, Joe Collins (ph).

KESTENBAUM: All right, all right, I get it. People love him. I'm jealous. I want to be him. What did he do?

CHACE: The first thing he does is kind of dramatic. He stops all manufacturing.

RON ARTALE: A very expensive decision. No one was let go, but everyone was furloughed.

CHACE: Ron Artale was the controller then. And he says that Kevin Ryan wanted to build good relationships with the biggest customer. Of course, that's eye doctors. And at the time, eye doctors were saying, you guys have inundated our offices with color contacts; enough with the contacts; we have closets full of them. And Kevin Ryan, as soon as he got there, he said to the doctors, no problem; send them back; we'll take them, no questions asked.

ARTALE: Now, what that did, of course, was make for an inventory nightmare, but it made for a lot of credibility with the doctors.

CHACE: Under new management, the company begins to question even the most basic practices, like that their contact lenses were sent out in packs of three - not three pairs - three contact lenses.

KESTENBAUM: What?

CHACE: I asked Tom Steiner about it.

Wait, why would you have three packs when people have two eyes?

STEINER: (Laughter) That question was, of course, discussed a lot.

CHACE: So new policy - even number. They send out packs of six, and they cut the price they were selling the lenses for. And that worked out well. They had a smaller profit margin, but they were making up for it with increased sales.

KESTENBAUM: They also shift to selling disposable color contacts, which are more popular than the extended-wear kind they'd been focusing on. And they launched some new high-profit items.

ARTALE: You may have seen the phrase Wild Eyes.

CHACE: Wild Eyes - lenses with thunderbolts, concentric circles, yellow lenses. Today, there's ones with, like, leopard spots and zebra stripes.

ARTALE: You know, fun lenses that could be sold at Halloween.

CHACE: So sales are growing, and Bain Capital - remember? - they're running this company. They do not stop there. Their plan is to sow up the color contact lens market. So they want to sell their color contacts overseas. And the way private equity works - classic private equity move again - they go back to the bank and borrow a bunch more money.

KESTENBAUM: This is like in the last podcast, where they borrowed money after buying the legal pad company to buy the envelope company and the hanging folder company.

CHACE: They borrow about $70 million or so, and they buy another lens company - Pilkington Barnes-Hinds (ph). Pilkington Barnes-Hinds made disposable lenses all around the world, places where color contacts were very popular. And also, they could make contacts that would filter out UV rays, like little-bitty sunglasses.

KESTENBAUM: Finally now, we are at the moment of truth. Bain has brought in a new boss. It's built up, and it's fixed up the company. And they're going to put their new, improved, global, wild-eye-crazy-UV-protecting-contact-lens company up for sale. In 1997, they have an IPO, an initial public offering, where they sell shares of this new company to the public, and it is a huge success.

CHACE: Executives and managers who hadn't received a raise since Kevin Ryan showed up - they cashed in their stock options that they had received instead, and they made quite a bit of money. And the people who worked in the factories actually making the contact lenses - they kept their jobs at a growing company.

KESTENBAUM: The banks that lent all that money to help this happen - they start to get paid back with interest. The private equity guys, who work at Bain Capital - they eventually cash out, and they get rich, also. Well, they were probably already rich, but they get richer. And the company, in general, is bigger and more successful, and we have awesome contact lenses. The end.

CHACE: This is the story that, if you are a supporter of private equity, you love. The company's struggling, you turn it around, the company is way more valuable.

KESTENBAUM: So what do we make of all of this? In this podcast and the other one, we've told you two stories now - right? - one about American Pad & Paper - an attempt to turn a legal pad company into a giant paper empire. That failed. People lost their jobs. The company went bankrupt.

CHACE: This other story about a neglected little contact lens company that goes on to greatness.

KESTENBAUM: So you got one success, one failure. Here's some raw numbers to help you think about that. The Wall Street Journal looked into all the businesses that Mitt Romney's firm Bain Capital - they've been studying those cases - invested in in the 1980s and '90s. There were 77 of those deals. Twenty-two percent of them, according to The Wall Street Journal, ended up in bankruptcy. An additional 8 percent ran into trouble.

CHACE: On the other hand, some of the deals went really well. So how do we weigh this? We called up two people who have spent a lot of time studying the private equity world. The first is Victor Fleischer. He's a professor of tax law at the University of Colorado. And David, you just asked him straight out.

KESTENBAUM: Can I just cut to the chase - is private equity good or bad?

VICTOR FLEISCHER: (Laughter) There's no hedging here. I have to say yes or no, huh?

CHACE: Yes or no.

FLEISCHER: I think private equity is bad.

CHACE: Our second expert is Steven Kaplan, a professor of finance at the Chicago Booth School of Business.

KESTENBAUM: Is private equity good or bad?

STEVEN KAPLAN: Overall, private equity is good for the economy.

KESTENBAUM: OK, so you have two experts, two different answers, unfortunately. This is what it's like when you look into private equity. The findings are complicated. We're going to have these guys talk us through three specific criticisms of the industry that come up a lot.

CHACE: Criticism No. 1 - the game is rigged in favor of private equity. This argument goes along these lines - if things go well, the private equity guys get super rich, and if things go badly, they can walk away, and we, the taxpayers, are left to pay. Here's Victor Fleischer, the private-equity-is-bad guy.

FLEISCHER: The companies start doing everything they can to make the interest payments, including things like firing workers, including things like trying to pull money out of the retirement funds that had been set aside for workers, renegotiating pension obligations going forward. And that creates social costs that's not borne by the company or the bank or the investors but is carried by all of us.

And I think what the private equity folks would say in response is, well, some of those firms were going to fail anyway. And so we shouldn't be saddled with the responsibility for closing down that factory. And that's a really hard question to know.

KESTENBAUM: So is this even an answerable question?

FLEISCHER: I'm not sure it is. I mean, I think it's really hard to measure all of these things. And, you know, I think the best we can say is that it's ambiguous whether it's good or bad.

KESTENBAUM: Steven Kaplan, the private-equity-is-good guy, he disagrees. He says, sure, not all private equity deals go well. But he says, they don't go bankrupt any more often than companies that aren't run by private equity firms. I will say the difficult thing here is that when you say don't go bankrupt more often than other companies that aren't run by private equity firms, that's sort of hard to measure.

I mean, what companies do you compare to? Do you compare to ones that are also carrying a lot of debt? Well, maybe they're carrying a lot of debt because they're already in trouble. So it's sort of hard to know. Steven Kaplan says, what is clear to him is that the private equity deals that turn out well, those new companies, they perform better than average?

KAPLAN: Overall private equity is good for the economy.

KESTENBAUM: Prove it.

KAPLAN: Prove it. OK. When you look at a large sample of firms, the companies that private equity investors invest in get more productive. Their operating margins go up, meaning their profits go up, and they tend to be more capital efficient.

CHACE: All right, onto contentious issue No. 2. This is the one thing that really drives some people crazy when they hear about private equity, which is that even when a deal goes bad and a company fails, the private equity firm still sometimes gets paid. It works like this - a private equity firm will go to the bank to borrow money using the companies as collateral. And they'll use that money that they borrowed to pay themselves and their investors. And that can make it seem like they never lose.

Like, even in the Ampad case from the previous podcast, that ended up in bankruptcy. But the private equity guys and their investors, they still got paid. Bain and the investors had put in $5 million. Then they borrowed $70 million to pay themselves back. They got paid, then the paper company went bankrupt.

KESTENBAUM: And this just seems crazy to some people. I mean, you've loaded this company up with debt. You haven't even turned a profit yet, and you're going to the bank and saying, I'd like to add to that debt by taking out a $70 million loan so I can pay myself handsomely. We asked Steven Kaplan about this. Why would a bank ever make that loan? He told us they don't like to.

KAPLAN: Banks don't really like to do that because they don't want to see the private equity firm taking money out. So they only make those loans when the companies are doing well and when the banks expect to get repaid. Now, sometimes they make a mistake. And in the case of Ampad, the banks did because the company's business deteriorated after that, and the company went into Chapter 11. But the - kind of the key point there is that somebody's got to give you the money to pay that dividend. And they only give you that money if they think they're going to get paid back.

KESTENBAUM: These private equity guys, he says, they're not paying themselves out of nowhere. Someone has to believe in them and give them that loan. If the banks believe the company's going to be successful, they might make the loan.

CHACE: Kaplan agrees it looks ugly to the outside world - taking out a loan to pay yourself back. And we dug up some data about how often it happens. According to research by Standard and Poor's, in 2011, private equity firms took out a total of $25 1/2 billion of these loans to pay themselves and their investors. That's out of a total of 180 billion loans to do all the buying of companies that year. So that's a pretty significant chunk.

KESTENBAUM: OK. Contentious issue No. 3 - taxes. This is the issue that got Mitt Romney in trouble when his tax returns came out, and the world learned that he only paid about 15 percent in taxes.

CHACE: If you work at a private equity firm, you are paid a percentage of the profits. But that money is not taxed the way a salary would be taxed. It's taxed at a much lower rate - about 15 percent versus the 30 or 35 percent if it were treated as your salary. The tax code treats this money as capital gains, like you'd made an investment in a stock or a bond that had turned out well.

KESTENBAUM: The Obama administration has proposed changing the tax law for private equity firms and hedge funds. Victor Fleischer, the private-equity-is-bad guy, he agrees that's a good idea.

CHACE: Steven Kaplan, our private-equity-is-good guy, says he might change it, but he would make it part of some broader tax reform.

KESTENBAUM: However you feel about what private equity does for the economy, there is one thing that is pretty clear - it makes a small group of people very, very wealthy - the people who work at the successful private equity firms.

CHACE: In fact, just yesterday, word came out about the man who started this whole thing with his enormous fund KKR. His name is Henry Kravis, and he's actually the subject of the movie you heard at the top, "Barbarians At The Gate." Henry Kravis is still around, so is KKR - still doing deals. And last year, Henry Kravis made $94 million. He's been making big money for decades - some of it taxed at a very low rate - and it's still making headlines.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA")

CHARLIE DANIELS BAND: But I'll take your bet. You're gonna regret 'cause I'm the best there's ever been. (Singing) Johnny, rosin up your bow, and play your fiddle hard 'cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards. And if you win, you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold. But if you lose, the devil gets your soul.

KESTENBAUM: As always, we want to hear what you think. Send us email - planetmoney@npr.org. You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter and Spotify.

CHACE: I'm Zoe Chace.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE DEVIL WENT DOWN TO GEORGIA")

CHARLIE DANIELS BAND: And he said, I'll start this show. And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow. And he pulled the bow across the strings, and it made a evil hiss. Then a band of demons joined in, and it sounded something like this.

**faster whisper:**
Ross don't you see this is our last chance the bastards are at the city gates
Let's stand at the bridge together. Let's stand at the bridge and push the barbarians back
right
Give me a minute the devil went down to Georgia. He was looking for a soul to steal
He was in a bag because he was way behind and he was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawing on a fiddle and playing it hot and the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
He said boy, let me tell you what I go and welcome to Planet Money. I'm David Keston
I'm Zoe chase. Today is Tuesday, February 28th, and that was a clip from the made-for-tv movie
Barbarians at the gate. It's the classic movie about private equity and in that scene the head of RJR
Nabisco is sweating in his office a private equity firm is coming to buy his company
Another buyout firm is urging him to resist today is our second podcast on private equity firms
Are they good evil somewhere in between?
We've been focusing on examples from Mitt Romney's firm Bain Capital since that's in the news last time we walked you through an
Investment in a company that made those yellow legal pads that deal went bust
Today we look at an investment that went well, and we step back and say okay private equity
What are we supposed to make of it first the indicator from Jacob Goldstein?
today's Planet Money indicator
six it has been almost six years since home prices started falling and
They are still falling. That's not news if it's still falling
Six years, and you're not gonna give me six years. It's a great indicator
The case Schiller index it came out today and as of December it said home prices hit a new post bubble low
So we've talked about before on the podcast how that housing market is different from say the stock market, right?
Where people can buy and sell instantly I want to sell a stock. Whoa, it just happened
You know, I want to sell a house
You know that that can take a longer time right and you add to that the fact that we've had this huge bubble followed by
A huge wave of foreclosures and millions of people underwater on their mortgages
So it makes sense that something like this is just gonna take a really long time
But I mean six years is a really long time. When's it gonna end? Well, I don't know is the short answer
But there are ways to think this through that are useful, you know, I mean first you can say well
There are still millions of people
Underwater on their mortgages there are millions more foreclosures that are likely to happen in the next couple years
So it's not like all of a sudden next month. Everything is gonna be great all of a sudden
But that said there are signs that the housing market is slowly sort of grinding back to normal in particular that
Glut of homes on the market that I kept talking about it was like a go-to indicator for me last year
That glut has basically disappeared. We're back to a kind of normal relation between supply and demand in the housing market
So that is a sign that it's kind of normalizing

They're just kind of bumping along the bottom maybe getting a little lower and then finally, you know
If you look really big picture the whole economy is clearly starting to get better
Maybe most importantly the number of new jobs the economy is adding is growing every month
So all these things together suggest, you know, the housing bust is not gonna go on forever and the market is starting to get back to normal
Thank you, Jacob. Thanks guys
Onto the podcast and more good times with Bain Capital
Mitt Romney's private equity firm on our last podcast if you didn't hear it
It featured an investment that ended like this
When you look back at at your legacy there at the company that you helped to build
What is the value added since the company did end up going bankrupt and breaking off into pieces
Is there a lasting value to what happened?
No, my opinion on this no lasting value it was
No, no no lasting value
The story was that Bain Capital came in and bought this company called Ampad that made legal pads
Those yellow pads of paper they wanted to build a paper empire. So they took out a whole bunch of loans
They bought a bunch of other companies file folder companies envelope company printer paper company
But eight years after the investment the new company American patent paper was broken into pieces in bankruptcy court
The investment that we're gonna look at today. It sounds very different
One of those times in your business career when things were going great
Things were going great times kept getting better and better. This is Tom Steiner
He was an executive at one of the companies that was bought by Mitt Romney's firm being capital in the 1990s
And he's actually nostalgic for the days that Bain was running the company. It was fun because people trusted each other
Being rewarded very nicely for their effort this time Bain was not buying a legal pad company in the hopes of making a paper empire
This time the business was a contact lens company called Wesley Jessen and

Disposable contact lenses were popular, but they weren't making disposables. They were making the old extended wear kind
So Bain Capital thought there was room for improvement
And color contacts like I've never worn them, but I've always thought they're totally awesome
I love them like if you have a green dress, then you just get green eyes to go with it. It's nice
So you were not alone. They weren't very profitable, but some people were buying them some people you might have heard of
Michael Jackson wore Wesley Jessen contacts in the thriller video. Remember you can see those yellow eyes
Bain thought these color contacts done right they could be big
Wesley Jessen had a patent and their patent on color contacts was so broad
One of the executives told me that they controlled 80% of the world market on color contacts
So Bain Capital decides this is going to be its next big private equity deal
It's going to buy the colored contact lens business and make it profitable
Here's Bill Flynn again
Bain came in and gave us a clean slate
Bain's investment was similar to the last deal we looked at
To buy the company you needed almost 50 million and this is the way private equity works
You don't have to put all that money up
Bain puts in about six and a half million and borrows the rest
This you may remember is what Bain did with Ampad
It's the classic private equity move
And now they're in that classic private equity position
They have to turn a company around a company that now has a whole bunch of debt
The very first and probably most important thing Bain did is they hired this one guy

Through his intelligence and charisma, he could get people to do things they had not normally done
Unanimous. That was Tom Steiner, Bill Flynn, Joe Collins
Alright, alright, I get it. People love him. I'm jealous. I want to be him. What did he do?
The first thing he does is kind of dramatic
He stops all manufacturing
A very expensive decision
No one was let go
But everyone was furloughed
Ron Artali was the controller then
And he says that Kevin Ryan wanted to build good relationships with the biggest customer
Of course that's iDoctors
And at the time iDoctors were saying
You guys have inundated our offices with color contacts
Enough with the contacts. We have closets full of them
And Kevin Ryan, as soon as he got there, he said to the doctors
No problem. Send them back. We'll take them. No questions asked
Now what that did of course was make for an inventory nightmare
But it made for a lot of credibility with the doctors
Under new management, the company begins to question even the most basic practices
Like that their contact lenses were sent out in packs of three
Not three pairs, three contact lenses
What?
I asked Tom Steiner about it
Why would you have three packs when people have two eyes?
That question was of course discussed a lot
So new policy, even number, they send out packs of six
And they cut the price they were selling the lenses for
And that worked out well. They had a smaller profit margin
But they were making up for it with increased sales
They also shift into selling disposable color contacts
Which are more popular than the extended wear kind they've been focusing on
And they launch some new high profit items
You may have seen the phrase wild eyes
Wild eyes, lenses with thunderbolts, concentric circles, yellow lenses
Today there's ones with leopard spots and zebra stripes
Fun lenses that could be sold at Halloween
So sales are growing and Bain Capital, remember, they're running this company
They do not stop there. Their plan is to sew up the color contact lens market
So they want to sell their color contacts overseas
And the way private equity works, classic private equity move again
They go back to the bank and borrow a bunch more money
This is like in the last podcast where they borrowed money
After buying the legal pad company to buy the envelope company
And the hanging folder company
They borrow about 70 million dollars or so
And they buy another lens company, Pilkington Barnes-Hines
Pilkington Barnes-Hines made disposable lenses all around the world
Places where color contacts were very popular
And also they could make contacts that would filter out UV rays
Like little bitty sunglasses
Finally now we are at the moment of truth
Bain has brought in a new boss
It's built up and it's fixed up the company
And they're going to put their new improved global wild eye crazy UV
Protecting contact lens company up for sale
In 1997 they have an IPO, an initial public offering
Where they sell shares of this new company to the public
And it is a huge success
Executives and managers who hadn't received a raise since Kevin Ryan showed up
They cashed in their stock options that they'd received instead
And they made quite a bit of money
And the people who worked in the factories actually making the contact lenses
They kept their jobs at a growing company
The banks that lent all that money to help this happen
They start to get paid back with interest
The private equity guys who work at Bain Capital
They eventually cash out and they get rich also
Well, they're probably already rich
But they get richer
And the company in general is bigger and more successful
And we have awesome contact lenses
The end
This is the story that if you are a supporter of private equity you love
The company is struggling
You turn it around
The company is way more valuable
So what do we make of all of this?
In this podcast and the other one we've told you two stories now
One about American pad and paper
An attempt to turn a legal pad company into a giant paper empire
That failed
People lost their jobs
The company went bankrupt
This other story about a neglected little contact lens company
That goes on to greatness
So you got one success, one failure
Here are some raw numbers to help you think about that
The Wall Street Journal looked into all the businesses that Mitt Romney's firm Bain Capital
We've been studying those cases
Invested in in the 1980s and 90s
There were 77 of those deals
22% of them, according to the Wall Street Journal, ended up in bankruptcy
An additional 8% ran into trouble
On the other hand, some of the deals went really well
So how do we weigh this?
We called up two people who have spent a lot of time studying the private equity world
The first is Victor Fleischer
He's a professor of tax law at the University of Colorado
And David, you just asked him straight out
Can I just cut to the chase?
Is private equity good or bad?
There's no hedging here, I have to say yes or no
Yes or no?
I think private equity is bad
Our second expert is Stephen Kaplan, a professor of finance at the Chicago Booth School of Business
Is private equity good or bad?
Overall, private equity is good for the economy
Okay, so you have two experts, two different answers, unfortunately
This is what it's like when you look into private equity
The findings are complicated
We're going to have these guys talk us through three specific criticisms of the industry
They come up a lot
Criticism number one
The game is rigged in favor of private equity
This argument goes along these lines
If things go well, the private equity guys get super rich
And if things go badly, they can walk away
And we, the taxpayers, are left to pay
Here's Victor Fleischer, the private equity is bad guy
The companies start doing everything they can to make the interest payments
Including things like firing workers
Including things like trying to pull money out of the retirement funds that have been set aside for workers
Renegotiating pension obligations going forward
And that creates social costs that's not borne by the company or the bank or the investors
But is carried by all of us
And I think what the private equity folks would say in response is
Well, some of those firms were going to fail anyway
And so we shouldn't be saddled with the responsibility for closing down that factory
And that's a really hard question to know
So is this even an answerable question?
I'm not sure it is
I mean, I think it's really hard to measure all of these things
And I think the best we can say is that it's ambiguous whether it's good or bad
Stephen Kaplan, the private equity is good guy, he disagrees
He says sure, not all private equity deals go well
But he says they don't go bankrupt any more often than companies that aren't run by private equity firms
I will say the difficult thing here is that when you say don't go bankrupt more often than other companies that aren't run by private equity firms
That's sort of hard to measure
I mean, what companies do you compare to?
You compare to ones that are also carrying a lot of debt
Well, maybe they're carrying a lot of debt because they're already in trouble
So it's sort of hard to know
Stephen Kaplan says what is clear to him is that the private equity deals that turn out well
Those new companies, they perform better than average
Overall, private equity is good for the economy
Prove it
Prove it, okay
When you look at a large sample of firms
The companies that private equity investors invest in get more productive
Their operating margins go up, meaning their profits go up
And they tend to be more capital efficient
All right, on to contentious issue number two
This is the one thing that really drives some people crazy when they hear about private equity
Which is that even when a deal goes bad and a company fails
The private equity firm still sometimes gets paid
It works like this
A private equity firm will go to the bank to borrow money
Using the companies as collateral
And they'll use that money that they borrowed to pay themselves and their investors
And that can make it seem like they never lose
Like even in the Ampad case from the previous podcast
That ended up in bankruptcy
But the private equity guys and their investors, they still got paid
Bain and the investors had put in $5 million
Then they borrowed $70 million to pay themselves back
They got paid, then the paper company went bankrupt
And this just seems crazy to some people
I mean, you've loaded this company up with debt
You haven't even turned a profit yet
And you're going to the bank and saying
I'd like to add to that debt by taking out a $70 million loan
So I can pay myself handsomely
We asked Stephen Kaplan about this
Why would a bank ever make that loan?
He told us they don't like to
Banks don't really like to do that
Because they don't want to see the private equity firm taking money out
So they only make those loans when the companies are doing well
And when the banks expect to get repaid
Now, sometimes they make a mistake
And in the case of Ampad, the banks did
Because the company's business deteriorated after that
And the company went into Chapter 11
But kind of the key point there is that
Somebody's got to give you the money to pay that dividend
And they only give you that money if they think they're going to get paid back
These private equity guys, he says, they're not paying themselves out of nowhere
Someone has to believe in them and give them that loan
If the banks believe the company's going to be successful
They might make the loan
Kaplan agrees it looks ugly to the outside world
Taking out a loan to pay yourself back
And we dug up some data about how often it happens
According to research by Standard & Poor's
In 2011, private equity firms took out a total of $25.5 billion of these loans
To pay themselves and their investors
That's out of a total of $180 billion loans to do all the buying of companies that year
So that's a pretty significant chunk
Okay, contentious issue number three, taxes
This is the issue that got Mitt Romney in trouble when his tax returns came out
And the world learned that he only paid about 15% in taxes
If you work at a private equity firm, you are paid a percentage of the profits
But that money is not taxed the way a salary would be taxed
It's taxed at a much lower rate, about 15% versus the 30 or 35% if it were treated as your salary
The tax code treats this money as capital gains
Like you'd made an investment in a stock or a bond that it turned out well
The Obama administration has proposed changing the tax law for private equity firms and hedge funds
Victor Fleischer, the private equity is bad guy, he agrees that's a good idea
Steven Kaplan, our private equity is good guy, says he might change it
But he would make it part of some broader tax reform
However you feel about what private equity does for the economy, there is one thing that is pretty clear
It makes a small group of people very, very wealthy
The people who work at the successful private equity firms
In fact, just yesterday, word came out about the man who started this whole thing
With his enormous fund, KKR, his name is Henry Kravis
And he's actually the subject of the movie you heard at the top, Barbarians at the Gate
Henry Kravis is still around, so is KKR, still doing deals
And last year, Henry Kravis made $94 million
He's been making big money for decades, some of it taxed at a very low rate
And it's still making headlines
