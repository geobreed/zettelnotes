David Unkovic is a thoughtful, mild-mannered guy who was appointed to save Harrisburg, Pa. The city had gone broke, and it was Unkovic's job to figure out how to fix things.

We visited Harrisburg a few weeks back. We talked to Unkovic. We talked to some of the people in Harrisburg who were suing him. And we visited the incinerator, a boondoggle that drove the city to bankruptcy.

Then, last week, Unkovic quit. "I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical crosswinds," his handwritten resignation letter says. "I wish the citizens of Harrisburg well in their ongoing quest for fiscal stability and good government, both of which they truly deserve."

Since resigning, Unkovic has gone missing. And he hasn't returned our calls or emails.

DAVID UNKOVIC: I'm not interested in being a public figure. I wish my name was never out there, that I - that all you weren't here, that my - that people wouldn't recognize me when I walk down the street in Harrisburg. I get no pleasure out of that. That's not my thing. I'm not particularly interested in exerting power.

DAUGHTER: (Singing) Throw me in the landfill. Don't think about the consequences. Throw me in the dirt pit. Don't think about the choices that you make.

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Zoe Chace.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Today is Tuesday, April 3. And that was the man who was appointed to run the city of Harrisburg, the capital of the state of Pennsylvania, that you heard at the top of the show. His name is Dave Unkovic.

CHACE: Today, the man that does not want power, he is given a large amount of power - ultimate power, actually, over the city of Harrisburg. Today on the show, what drove this man crazy.

JOFFE-WALT: That's in a minute after the PLANET MONEY indicator from Jacob Goldstein. Jacob, what do you have for us?

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator is 53.4. The Purchasing Managers' Index for March was 53.4. So Purchasing Managers' Index, this is - it's a measure, really, of how the manufacturing sector is doing. It's based on this big survey. And if the number is over 50, it means the manufacturing sector is expanding, is growing. And so this latest number, 53.4, it tells us that in March, the manufacturing sector was indeed growing.

JOFFE-WALT: Which is a good thing.

GOLDSTEIN: Sure, yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: So this is a survey of manufacturers, which also is sort of like the Consumer Confidence Survey. It's always a little hard to know, like, when you ask people how they feel about things what that actually means. Does it mean anything?

GOLDSTEIN: That's a fair question. Surveys are good things to be wary of. But this particular survey - it is pretty solid. They ask detailed questions about orders and inventory and delivering, and the people who are answering basically say they're worse, they're the same, they're better. You know, it's not like they're saying how they feel. And the other thing - and really, the sort of bottom-line thing about this index is it is pretty good as an early indicator of how the economy is doing.

It comes out much, much faster than other big indicators like GDP, which takes many months and then is revised again and again. And it does end up tracking pretty closely with how the overall economy is doing. So this March Purchasing Managers' Index of 53.4 - this is yet another sign that the economic recovery is sort of chugging along, is just doing OK.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. I like the happy indicators.

GOLDSTEIN: I like a happy economy.

JOFFE-WALT: Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so on to the podcast. The man that you heard at the top, Dave Unkovic, he's the center of our show. And he is a mild-mannered, bow-tie-wearing, gentle fellow. He's a gentle soul. But I want to tell you right now that he has disappeared. Right now, no one knows where he is. And Dave Unkovic was put in charge of Harrisburg. He has fled, and all he has left behind is a scrawled, handwritten note. Zoe, you spent a lot of time with Unkovic a couple weeks ago, so we're going to hear from him on this podcast in just a couple minutes. But before we get to that, I think we need to talk about what is likely to have drove him out of town, what is likely to have drove this sane man mad.

CHACE: It all starts with an incinerator.

ERIC PAPENFUSE: Welcome to the almost $350-million-dollar-in-debt Harrisburg incinerator. You see the trucks sort of lining up and coming in. If we were to go in and follow them, you'd see this huge, huge mound of trash.

CHACE: The Harrisburg incinerator is a fire-breathing, money-destroying monster, and the incinerator debt is an albatross around the city's neck. I drove out to see it with Eric Papenfuse. And he used to be one of the people in charge of the incinerator, so he took me around the back of it, where it was a little more peaceful.

Let's just sit on one of these things.

PAPENFUSE: Yes, let's sit on the pressure vent alternating. Sure.

CHACE: Watch out for the rusty nails.

PAPENFUSE: OK. It's true.

CHACE: This field behind the incinerator, it's littered with old machinery - basically parts of the incinerator that don't work like old insulation, steel tubing. What went wrong with the Harrisburg incinerator? It's all around us.

JOFFE-WALT: You're basically standing in a field that tells the story of Harrisburg's demise.

CHACE: Exactly.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so let's just tell that story really quickly. The incinerator was built 30 years ago, and basically, it has never worked right. It has always been a disaster. At first, it didn't work great. And what did Harrisburg do about it? They borrowed money to fix it. And that didn't work, so they borrowed more money. And that didn't work.

CHACE: Over time, more and more parts of the incinerator end up back in this field where we're sitting.

JOFFE-WALT: And by the turn of the millennium, Harrisburg actually got the incinerator working well. They finally had their incinerator. They were finally burning trash.

CHACE: And then the EPA comes in and says, this is too polluting. This thing that you borrowed millions of dollars to build, you have to shut it down.

PAPENFUSE: That's when the doubling down occurs. That's when they say, we will double the debt and we will expand the incinerator.

CHACE: When the EPA has shut it down, the mayor of Harrisburg decides, let's use new, exciting incinerator technology to totally remake the thing.

JOFFE-WALT: And right now that sounds like a totally crazy thing to do, but the idea was that the incinerator would pay for itself. If they could get it up and running and successful, it would start paying for its existence.

CHACE: Exactly. And as we sat here behind the incinerator, like, I saw these trucks pull in. And every time the trucks pull in, they pay money to drop off their garbage. And in theory, the more trash the incinerator can burn, the more money it can make.

JOFFE-WALT: The problem was this project was so laden with debt that even if everybody in Harrisburg - and probably even if everybody in Pennsylvania and New Jersey - came to get their trash burned here, it probably could never pay back all the debt.

PAPENFUSE: And of course, eventually, the money comes due.

CHACE: Eric Papenfuse says that by 2010, the incinerator debt had ballooned to $300 million-plus. And the city, no matter how well the incinerator is doing, there is no way they can pay that money back.

JOFFE-WALT: In the battle between city and its incinerator, the incinerator wins. The debt is just overpowering. And this is the end of the dream of Harrisburg as a trash capital.

CHACE: The voters tossed the mayor out. The city tried to throw itself into bankruptcy. And the state of Pennsylvania said no, we have a different idea. Our idea - we're going to put David Unkovic in charge.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: David Unkovic, a 30-year veteran in public finance, is Governor Tom Corbett's choice as receiver for the city of Harrisburg.

UNKOVIC: I now am working for the state, and I'm going to do my best job to come up with the best plan for the city.

CHACE: Four months ago, into the chaos walks this sweet guy - calm, rational, the occasional bow tie, glasses. He's respectful. He's humble. And most of all, in a city that felt lied to by so many public officials, he was honest. People had made these big promises to fix the city and they'd never worked. Unkovic wasn't like that.

And you think you can get this city out of debt.

UNKOVIC: I don't say I am going to do anything. I think a lot of people have to help get this city turned around. But, yeah, I think it can happen.

CHACE: Unkovic is a municipal bond lawyer. He's got no experience running a city, but lots of experience dealing with city finances. And he actually volunteered for the job. He's weirdly passionate about Pennsylvania. And...

JOFFE-WALT: I don't know how you could be weirdly passionate about Pennsylvania. As a person from Pennsylvania...

CHACE: It's all right, Philly. relax.

JOFFE-WALT: ...You can only weirdly unpassionate about Pennsylvania.

CHACE: (Laughter) You're being weird right now and passionate.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

CHACE: But he shared your passion for Pennsylvania, and the state capital was in trouble. So he showed up here. He got a new office. He filled it with pictures of baseball players and American presidents, especially ones who were good at working with their rivals, ones who were good at handling conflict.

UNKOVIC: These are busts of Lincoln, right? I have a Lincoln fetish. And Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln, Lincoln.

CHACE: So he gets to Harrisburg with all his things, he unpacks, looks around and quickly finds that things are worse than he thought.

JOFFE-WALT: There is the incinerator, and everybody in Harrisburg knew about that. People outside of Harrisburg knew about that. But there are lots of other debts as well. The money the mayor had borrowed - it didn't actually all go to burning trash. Some of it went to various special projects for the former mayor.

CHACE: One obsession the former mayor had was to make Harrisburg a cultural capital with all these museums, and so he had actually bought these crazy artifacts from all over. He wanted to make a Wild West museum in Harrisburg, so he had Buffalo Bill's cane and Doc Holliday's dental chair - like, all this stuff piled in a warehouse.

JOFFE-WALT: The trash capital and also cultural capital.

CHACE: Exactly.

JOFFE-WALT: And you saw the artifacts, right?

CHACE: I did. They were all sort of stacked haphazardly in a warehouse right next to the incinerator. And they are never going to be displayed in Harrisburg. They're being auctioned off to deal with the debt.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so let's tally up what Dave Unkovic has found. Total debt for the city of Harrisburg - half a billion dollars. And that is a city of 50,000 people, so that's a huge operating deficit.

CHACE: And, you know - and I checked it out. It actually has more debt per capita than any city in the country.

JOFFE-WALT: Poor Pennsylvania.

CHACE: I know. Unkovic also found what looked like some pretty shady deals in the way that a lot of the debt was financed - like, money moved around from project to project. But even as he's discovering how kind of sketchy some of this looks, at least with me, he was hesitant to pass judgment.

UNKOVIC: Things have been pushed off for a long time, and they can't be pushed off anymore. The city simply doesn't have enough money. You know, a lot of governments try one-time fixes for those sorts of things, which the city of Harrisburg has done, too. But at some point, you run through the one-time fixes, and then you're having - you just have to deal with the problems.

JOFFE-WALT: That sounds very diplomatic.

CHACE: That's his style.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so Unkovic goes through. He finishes sort of assessing the situation. And he comes up with this 200-page plan, right? And this is his plan to get the city out of debt. And, Zoe, we're looking at it. I think we could sum it up by basically saying, the plan includes four things. Number one, raise taxes; number two, cut union benefits; number three, ask the creditors to take a loss - basically say, all that money we owe you, we can't pay it all back; and number four, sell city assets - the water treatment plant, the infamous incinerator, sell that stuff - which, tragically, I have to say about the incinerator, is actually running very well at the moment. So it's going to make a lot of money for somebody else, not for Harrisburg.

CHACE: But Unkovic, who believes deeply in the potential of reasoned debate - he takes this 200-page plan and he presents it to everybody in Harrisburg who will listen.

UNKOVIC: I mean, that's the goal of the plan, is to deal with the incinerator debt. You know, it's one of the main focuses of the plan.

CHACE: I went to a public meeting at Eric Papenfuse's bookstore in Midtown, Harrisburg. The mayor was on one side, a city councilwoman was on the other side, and Unkovic sat in the middle. And people were really trying to figure out how to manage this problem. Their entire city is underwater. So there would be, you know, the earnestly pragmatic suggestion...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: We'd ask that Mr. Unkovic consider not selling the water treatment plant because $10 gained today will lose a thousand dollars tomorrow.

CHACE: ...The single-issue solutions. Like, this woman believes the answer to the debt problem - marijuana.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Well, I believe in the three R's. The revenue remedy is reefer.

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And I have some information to back this up.

CHACE: But the reality of just not having enough money is summed up in this exchange right here. Here's Mayor Linda Thompson answering a question about police.

LINDA THOMPSON: If I had the money, I would hire more police officers to make sure that we hire 25 a year. So the more money we get in, the more money will go to public safety. And I'm not going to back down from that.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Thank you. Mr. Unkovic?

UNKOVIC: I don't have anything to add to that.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Do we have the money?

(LAUGHTER)

UNKOVIC: Public safety is obviously the most important duty of government, so I do recognize that. The economic reality is that in the long run, the city's revenues and expenditures have to match.

JOFFE-WALT: Zoe, that is an Abraham Lincoln fan's way of saying no.

CHACE: Exactly. And it sounded at the meeting like Unkovic had things pretty well under control, but he didn't quite. The problem with a plan where everybody has to pay is a lot of people don't want to do that. And...

JOFFE-WALT: 'Cause everybody has to pay.

CHACE: Exactly. And Unkovic seemed to think that if he very logically and rationally presented this plan, everybody would jump on board. As we walked away from the meeting, I asked him about that.

Do you feel like people like your plan?

UNKOVIC: I don't think like's the right word. I mean, it's got a lot of pain in it, so ultimately it has a chance of working if they view it as being fair. But they asked for a lot from a lot of people, so I don't think anybody in particular likes it.

CHACE: It's the conversations with the unions that can be the hardest, he says. And I met up with one of them, this guy, Eric Jenkins - he's the head of the firefighters union - at the Keystone Diner in town.

ERIC JENKINS: Yes, we have good benefits, but we damn well earn them. Everybody in this room is not open to running into a building that's burning. I am.

CHACE: You guys are going to have to take some cuts, right?

JENKINS: We'd have no problem. In our first meeting with this receiver, the first question I asked him is, what kind of numbers are you looking for?

CHACE: Across the table from Jenkins at breakfast is this other guy, Nevin Mindlin. He ran for mayor on the Republican ticket last time around.

NEVIN MINDLIN: Unkovic, as a human being, is a very - seems like a very decent soul. But I was telling Eric before you got here that Patrick Henry's line during the revolution was suffer not by self to be betrayed by a kiss.

CHACE: Mindlin and Jenkins have decided to fight back. He and Jenkins are suing to get the receiver removed, saying having a technocrat in charge of an American city is totally undemocratic. And they name Unkovic in the lawsuit. They want him out of there.

JOFFE-WALT: And for Harrisburg - I mean, this isn't unusual, right? This kind of fight, you know, in city politics, especially in Harrisburg, which sort of has a reputation for being kind of scrappy, is not that surprising. You know, this is sort of the normal rough-and-tumble.

CHACE: Unkovic spent his life as a lawyer and a history buff. And when you hear him speak about the way he kind of expects the city to rally around, it can sound a little naive, like that people would just respond rationally to the idea that they all have to take some cuts and they all have to pay up.

JOFFE-WALT: He didn't expect to get sued for his 200-page plan.

CHACE: I don't think so, but he certainly was getting sued by a couple people. And when I talked to him, the signs of stress were very clear. Like, Unkovic told me this job is very emotionally draining. He has trouble sleeping. He wakes up at 4 in the morning and he can't get back to sleep. He's thinking about problems that have come up with the city finances. But he deals with it. He does Vinyasa yoga. He drives back to Philly on the weekends to see his family.

And, Chana, when I left Harrisburg, I had no idea what was about to happen next. Like, I thought this was the end of the story. I actually did a story for the radio about - you know, it was kind of a profile of this guy who's fighting to save Harrisburg. But then I got a phone call. And I heard that Unkovic had kind of snapped.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So, Zoe, this is where it gets really crazy. Walk us through what happened.

CHACE: So remember the lawsuit - right? - to get him out.

JOFFE-WALT: Yes.

CHACE: ...Of the city. Two weeks ago, there was a hearing. And afterwards, he walks out of the court and there's a bunch of reporters on the street. And when I heard the tape of what he says to them, I almost didn't recognize him. Like, this man that I had hung out with and spent a bunch of time with, he's a diplomacist. He didn't have an unkind word for anyone.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNKOVIC: People were complaining in the court today about potholes in the - or not potholes, but the sinkholes in the streets. And I put in my plan - there's a paragraph in the front part of the plan that directly connects these problems with the incinerator to these holes in the street. They're all connected. All these - all this moving around of money, all these transactions that were done that weren't proper have consequences. It was - it's basically a house of cards, and the cards are coming down. And they're coming down now. And they're all coming down at the same time.

CHACE: Then last week, Unkovic gave a press conference to just a few reporters. And he's shaking. He's vehement. He's sweaty. And he just starts naming names, people who had been involved in the financing around the incinerator and taking out those loans that you'd really just need a hope and a prayer to be able to pay back.

JOFFE-WALT: Like some of the sketchy stuff he was referring earlier.

CHACE: He had - as soon as he got there that he started finding out about. And, you know, so he names a lobbyist for the county. He names a state senator. And, of course, he names the former mayor, Stephen Reed.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNKOVIC: I'm just trying to do the best I can. All I know is, I'm dealing with a lot of public officials who have lots of agendas. And they're pushing their agendas. And so what choice do I have - to sit there and do nothing and watch this plan deteriorate and have this city go into financial chaos? Or am I going to fight back? Which is what I'm doing - and I'm not enjoying it. I don't want to have these conversations about people in public, but these people are pushing things that are not in the best interest of this city. I'm trying to do what's in the best interest of the city, and I'll continue to do so.

CHACE: But two days later, very early last Friday morning, Unkovic takes a single page of his stationery. In the upper-left-hand corner is his little logo, Office of the Receiver. He takes a pen, and he scrawls this letter. It's barely legible. And he walks the letter over to the courthouse. I have a copy right here. This is what it says.

(Reading) Dear Judge Leadbetter, please accept my resignation as receiver for the city of Harrisburg. I have done my best to use my powers as receiver to bring fiscal stability to the city of Harrisburg. However, I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical cross winds and am no longer in a position to effectuate a solution. I wish the citizens of the city of Harrisburg well in their ongoing quest for fiscal stability and good government, both of which they truly deserve.

JOFFE-WALT: And with that, David Unkovic disappears.

CHACE: He's gone. His one assistant is no longer answering the phone, and I think he's just fled the city. I've called. I've texted. I've emailed him a bunch of times. I can't get hold of him.

JOFFE-WALT: Wait; so who is actually in charge of Harrisburg right now?

CHACE: Right now - I don't know. None of us really know who's in charge of the money.

JOFFE-WALT: Of the capital of Pennsylvania?

CHACE: That's right.

JOFFE-WALT: So they did all of this - like, the whole idea of bringing Unkovic in was that they could avoid going to bankruptcy court. Like, he was going to write this 200-page plan and they wouldn't have to go to bankruptcy court, which is something you don't want to do as a municipality because if you go to bankruptcy court, things get messy. People fight. And everybody who lends the city money sees that and doesn't want to lend the city money anymore. They get cut off.

CHACE: But you know what? The city of Harrisburg, all this time, I think they really wanted a fight. People there are very mad about the way this whole thing has gone down. And they kind of want to go into bankruptcy and fight with the creditors, fight with the people who made these loans. And, I mean, Unkovic, maybe he should've seen that coming. I mean, even Abraham Lincoln knows sometimes you have to go to war.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LANDFILL")

DAUGHTER: (Singing) So leave me in the cold. Wait until the snow covers me up so I cannot move.

No, we have a different idea our idea. We're gonna put David Unkovic in charge
David Unkovic a 30 year veteran in public finance is governor Tom Corbett's choice as receiver for the city of Harrisburg
I now am working for the state and I'm gonna do
my best
Job to come up with the best plan for the city four months ago into the chaos walks this sweet guy calm
Rational the occasional bowtie glasses. He's respectful
He's humble and most of all in a city that felt lied to by so many public officials
He was honest people had made these big promises to fix the city and they'd never worked
Unkovic wasn't like that and you think you can get this city out of debt. I don't say I I'm gonna do anything
I think a lot of people have to help get this city turned around. But yeah, I think it can happen
Unkovic is a municipal bond lawyer
He's got no experience running a city but lots of experience dealing with city finances and he actually
Volunteered for the job. He's weirdly passionate about Pennsylvania
And I don't know how you can be weirdly passionate about Pennsylvania as a person from Pennsylvania. Sorry
You can only be weirdly relaxed
You're being weird right now and passionate
But he shared your passion for Pennsylvania and the state capital was in trouble. So he showed up here
He got a new office. He filled it with pictures of baseball players and American presidents
Especially ones who are good at working with their rivals ones who are good at handling conflict
these are busts of Lincoln, right I have a Lincoln fetish and
Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln Lincoln
So he gets to Harrisburg with all his things he unpacks looks around and quickly finds that things are worse than he thought
There's the incinerator then everybody in Harrisburg knew about that people outside of Harrisburg knew about that
But there are lots of other debts as well the money the mayor had borrowed
It didn't actually all go to burning trash
Some of it went to various special projects for the former mayor one obsession
The former mayor had was to make Harrisburg a cultural capital with all these museums
And so he had actually bought these crazy artifacts from all over he wanted to make a Wild West Museum in Harrisburg
So he had Buffalo Bill's cane and Doc Holliday's dental chair like all this stuff
Piled in a warehouse trash capital and also cultural capital exactly and you saw the artifacts, right?
I did they're all sort of stacked haphazardly in a warehouse right next to the incinerator
And they are never going to be displayed in Harrisburg. They're being auctioned off to deal with the debt
Okay, so let's tally up with Dave Unkewick has found total debt for the city of Harrisburg
Half a billion dollars and that is a city of 50,000 people. So that's a huge
Operating deficit and you know and I checked it out. It actually has more debt per capita than any city in the country
Poor, Pennsylvania
I know Unkewick also found what looked like some pretty shady deals in the way that a lot of the debt was
Financed like money moved around from project to project
But even as he's discovering how kind of sketchy some of this looks at least with me
He was hesitant to pass judgment things have been pushed off
For a long time and they can't be pushed off anymore. The city simply doesn't have enough money
You know a lot of governments try one-time fixes for those sorts of things
Which city of Harrisburg has done too, but at some point you run through the one-time fixes
And then you're having you just have to deal with the problems. That sounds very diplomatic
That's his style. Okay, so Unkewick goes through he finishes sort of assessing the situation and he comes up with this
200 page plan right and this is his plan to get the city out of debt and
Zoe we're looking at it
I think we could sum it up by basically saying the plan includes four things number one
Raise taxes number two cut union benefits number three ask the creditors to take a loss
Basically say all that money we owe you we can't pay it all back and number four sell city assets the water treatment plant
The infamous incinerator sell that stuff which tragically have to say about the incinerator is actually running very well at the moment
So it's gonna make a lot of money for somebody else not for Harrisburg
But Unkewick who believes deeply in the potential of reasoned debate
He takes this 200 page plan and he presents it to everybody in Harrisburg who will listen
I mean, that's the goal of the plan is to deal with the incinerator debt
It's one of the main focuses of the plan I went to a public meeting at Eric Pappenfus's bookstore in Midtown
Harrisburg the mayor was on one side a city councilwoman was on the other side and Unkewick sat in the middle and
People were really trying to figure out how to manage this problem. Their entire city is underwater
So there would be you know, the earnestly pragmatic suggestion
We'd ask that Mr. Unkewick consider not selling the water treatment plant because ten dollars gained today will lose a thousand dollars tomorrow
The single-issue solutions like this woman believes the answer to the debt problem
Marijuana, well, I believe in the three R's the revenue remedy is reefer and I have some
Information to back this up
But the reality of just not having enough money is summed up in this exchange right here
Here's mayor Linda Thompson answering a question about police
If I had the money I would hire more police officers to make sure that we hire
25 a year so the more money we get in the more money will go to public safety and I'm not going to back
Down from that. Thank you. Mr. Unkewick. I don't have anything to add. Do we have the money?
Public safety is obviously the most important duty of government. So I do recognize that
the economic reality is
That in the long run this the city's revenues and expenditures have to match
Zoe that is an Abraham Lincoln fans way of saying no
Exactly and it sounded at the meeting like Unkewick had things pretty well under control
But he didn't quite the problem with the plan where everybody has to pay is a lot of people
Don't want to do that and everybody has to pay exactly and Unkewick seemed to think that if you very logically and rationally
Presented this plan everybody would jump on board as we walked away from the meeting. I asked him about that
Do you feel like people like your plan?
I don't think likes the right word. I mean, it's it's got a lot of pain in it. So
Ultimately, it it has a chance of working if they view it as being fair
But it asked for a lot from a lot of people so I don't think anybody in particular likes it
It's the conversations with the unions that can be the hardest
He says and I met up with one of them this guy Eric Jenkins
He's the head of the Firefighters Union at the Keystone diner in town. Yes, we have good benefits
But we damn well earn them
Everybody in this room is not open to running into a building that's burning
I am you guys are gonna have to take some cuts, right?
We'd have no problem and our first meeting with this this receiver
The first question I asked him is what kind of numbers are you looking for?
Across the table from Jenkins at breakfast is this other guy Nevin Mindlin
He ran for mayor on the Republican ticket last time around
Unkevich as a human being is a very seems like a very decent soul
But I was telling Eric before you got here that Patrick Henry's line during the revolution was
Suffer not thyself to be betrayed by a kiss
Mindlin and Jenkins have decided to fight back
He and Jenkins are suing to get the receiver removed saying having a technocrat in charge of an American city is totally undemocratic
And they name Unkevich in the lawsuit. They want him out of there and for Harrisburg
I mean, this isn't unusual right this kind of fight
You know in city politics, especially in Harrisburg, which sort of has a reputation for being kind of scrappy
It's not that surprising, you know, this is sort of the normal rough-and-tumble
Unkevich spent his life as a lawyer and a history buff
And when you hear him speak about the way he kind of expects the city to rally around
It can sound a little naive like that
People would just respond rationally to the idea that they all have to take some cuts and they all have to pay up
He didn't expect to get sued for his 200 page plan
I don't think so
But he certainly was getting sued by a couple people and when I talked to him the signs of stress were very
Clear like Unkevich told me this job is very emotionally draining. He has trouble sleeping
He wakes up at four in the morning and he can't get back to sleep
He's thinking about problems that have come up with the city finances, but he deals with it
He does vinyasa yoga
He drives back to Philly on the weekends to see his family and Hannah when I left Harrisburg
I had no idea what was about to happen next like I thought this was the end of the story
I actually did a story for the radio about you know, it's kind of a profile of this guy who's fighting to save Harrisburg
But then I got a phone call and I heard that Unkevich had kind of snapped
Okay, so Zoe this is where it gets really crazy walk us through what happened
So remember the lawsuit right to get him out of the city two weeks ago
There was a hearing and afterwards he walks out of the court and there's a bunch of reporters on the street
And when I heard the tape of what he says to them
I almost didn't recognize him like this man that I had hung out with and spent a bunch of time with
He's a diplomat assist. He didn't have an unkind word for anyone
people were complaining in the court today about
About potholes in this there are no potholes but the sinkholes in the streets and I put in my plan
There's a paragraph
In the front part of the plan that directly connects these problems with the incinerator to these holes in the street
They're all connected
All these all this moving around of money all these transactions that were done that weren't proper
Have consequences
It was it's basically a house of cards and the cards are coming down and they're coming down now and they're all coming
down at the same time
Then last week Uncovich gave a press conference to just a few reporters and he's shaking he's vehement
He's sweaty and he just starts
naming names people who had been involved in the financing around the
Incinerator and and taking out those loans that you'd really just need a hope and a prayer to be able to pay back
Like some of the sketchy stuff he was he had been as soon as he got there that he started finding out
About you know, so he names a lobbyist for the county
He names a state senator and of course, he names the former mayor Stephen Reed
I'm just trying to do the best I can all I know is I'm dealing with a lot of public officials
Who have lots of agendas and they're pushing their agendas
And so what choice do I have to sit there and do nothing and watch this plan?
Deteriorate and have this city go into financial chaos
Or am I going to fight back which is what I'm doing and I'm not enjoying it
I don't want to have these conversations about
people
In public, but these people are pushing things that are not in the best interest of this city
I'm trying to do what's in the best interest of the city and I'll continue to do so
But two days later very early last Friday morning
Unkovic takes a single page of his stationery their upper left-hand corner is his little logo office of the receiver
He takes a pen and he scrolls this letter. It's barely legible and he walks the letter over to the courthouse
I have a copyright here. This is what it says
Dear judge Ledbetter, please accept my resignation as receiver for the city of Harrisburg
I have done my best to use my powers as receiver to bring fiscal stability to the city of Harrisburg
However, I find myself in an untenable position in the political and ethical crosswinds
And I'm no longer in a position to effectuate a solution
I wish the citizens of the city of Harrisburg well in their ongoing quest for fiscal stability and good government
Both of which they truly deserve
And with that David Unkovic disappears
He's gone his one assistant is no longer answering the phone and I think he's just fled the city
I've called I've texted I've emailed him a bunch of times. I can't get hold of him
Wait, so who is actually in charge of Harrisburg right now right now. I don't know
None of us really know who's in charge of the money of the capital of Pennsylvania. That's right
So they did all of this like the whole idea of bringing Unkovic in was that they could avoid
Going to bankruptcy court like he was gonna write this 200 page plan and they wouldn't have to go to bankruptcy court
Which is something you don't want to do as a municipality because if you go to bankruptcy court things get messy
People fight and everybody who lends the city money sees that and doesn't want to lend the city money anymore
But you know what the city of Harrisburg all this time
I think they really wanted a fight people there are very mad about the way this whole thing has gone down and they
Kind of want to go into bankruptcy and fight with the creditors fight with the people who made these loans and I mean
Unkovic maybe he should have seen that coming. I mean even Abraham Lincoln knows sometimes you have to go to war
Until the snow covers me up so I cannot
