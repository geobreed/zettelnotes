Legislation in Congress would get rid of dollar bills and replace them with coins. Proponents say coins are easier to use and save the country money in the long run. The bill people say none of this is true. Should we kill the dollar bill? On today's show we go deep into the nature of money itself, and we find a clear answer to this question. We haul in a giant box of coins, talk to the guy who actually makes dollar bills, and watch a Senator try to use a vending machine.

Our story begins last month inside a busy Washington, D.C. subway station plastered with posters of giant dollar bills. One of them says: "Tell Congress to stop wasting time trying to eliminate the dollar bill." Another asks: "Do you heart the dollar?"

Political fights in the nation's capital normally involve billions or even trillions, not single dollars. What's going on here?

This being Washington, there's a back story. The $70,000 ad blitz was part of a small lobbying war over the fate of the dollar bill. On one side, leading a legislative charge to eliminate the dollar bill and replace it with a dollar coin, are Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and John McCain, R-Ariz.

"The most important thing is it's just more efficient. It's way more efficient than a paper dollar," Harkin says. "Canada has a coin that's worth $2 ... Switzerland has one worth about $5... And yet, what have we got? We got a 25-cent piece."

It's worth noting that Harkin and McCain both represent states that are home to businesses that profit from the production of dollar coins.

In Harkin's case, it's PMX Industries Inc., of Cedar Rapids. The company provides metal sheets the U.S. Mint uses to make coins. Harkin says he was pro-coin before PMX was doing business with the U.S. Mint, and so comes to the issue "with clean hands."

McCain's state, Arizona, has the nation's most productive copper mines, and dollar coins are made mostly of copper. McCain declined NPR's request for an interview for this story.

On one level, the logic is persuasive. Coins last longer, so they might make a better choice for supplying the country with pocket money. But coins also cost more to make.

But when you do the math, the situation is more complicated.

To be fair, the people making the case for the paper dollar also have something at stake. Paper advocates include Crane & Co., which has been making the paper for U.S. bills since 1879. The firm started Americans for George, which is responsible for that subway ad campaign.

"U.S. currency: It's some of the most durable banknotes on the planet," says company vice president Douglas Crane, "And the one-dollar bill is probably the hardest-working note there is.

Now a coin-versus-bill cage match is on. Harkin's bill would require Federal Reserve banks to stop putting $1 bills into circulation in as little as four years.

To make their arguments, both sides in the skirmish point to the same reports from the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan arm of Congress.

In its most recent report, the GAO recommends switching to coins, which could make $4.4 billion for the government over 30 years. But the report says the government benefit does not come from the fact that coins are more cost effective. Instead the benefit comes from something called "seigniorage."

Seigniorage is the profit the government makes from having money out in the economy. More money out there means more profit for the government.

Over time, coins earn more seigniorage for the government, but only because we don't like using them.

"Lots of people when they take coins out of their pocket or purse at the end of the day put them in what we call a coin jar," says the GAO's Lorelei St. James, who oversaw the agency's most recent study.

As a result, the GAO estimates that if the government were to eliminate $1 bills and switch to coins, it would have to replace every two bills with three coins, because one of the coins would sit idle.

So more coins means more profit for the government. But where does that profit come from? It comes from us — the public.

If you put a dollar coin in a coin jar, that's a dollar you haven't invested, a dollar you're not doing anything with. Economists consider this a kind of tax.

There's really no dispute on this point among economists. Even one referred to NPR by the coin lobbying group Dollar Coin Alliance said as much, after reading the GAO report.

"The more I read it, the less I agreed with it," says Robert Whaples, an economist at Wake Forest University.

He says the report focused on the wrong thing: profits to the government. "The government can make profits in all sorts of bad ways," he says.

"People are going to be putting them on top of their bureaus instead of spending them for transactions and that seems like a big waste of resources to me," he says. "This does not seem like a good way to raise money."

As to the question of why it made sense for other countries to switch from small denomination bills to coins, the answer seems to be: Their bills did not last nearly as long as U.S. bills. The Federal Reserve says typical lifetimes of bills from those countries were just three to six months.

Congress has tried unsuccessfully to get Americans to accept dollar coins before.

Last June, NPR reported on more than a billion dollar coins piling up in Federal Reserve vaults.

The coins have been languishing in vaults because the public has rejected them, while a Congressional mandate required continued production of coins to commemorate each president.

The Obama administration announced in December that it would suspend production of presidential dollars for circulation.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

Subway riders here in Washington were recently the target audience for an unusual ad campaign. The ads show giant one dollar bills and asked, do you heart the dollar? They're part of a small lobbying war over the fate of the dollar bill. There's legislation in the House and Senate that would eliminate all $1 bills and replace them with dollar coins.

NPR's investigative unit and our Planet Money team checked into the debate over coins versus bills. And David Kestenbaum and Robert Benincasa think they have a winner.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Here's the question. Given that we need to have some form of money out there worth a dollar, which is more cost effective, a bill or a coin?

ROBERT BENINCASA, BYLINE: Before we tell you who the winner is, let's hear each side's case.

KESTENBAUM: In one corner, arguing on behalf of the dollar coin, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat from Iowa. He told us coins are a clear win. They last much longer than bills.

SENATOR TOM HARKIN: The most important thing is it's just more efficient. It's way more efficient than a paper dollar.

BENINCASA: Dollar coins last something like 30 years and he says switching to coins would save hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

KESTENBAUM: Coins are also, he says, easier to stick into vending machines. Harkin's office put out a video of him struggling to buy a snack with a worn out $1 bill.

(SOUNDBITE OF AD)

KESTENBAUM: Harkin can rattle off a long list of countries that have replaced bills with coins.

HARKIN: Canada has a coin that's worth $2. England has a coin worth about $3 U.S. Switzerland has one worth about $5 U.S. And yet, what have we got? We got a 25-cent piece.

KESTENBAUM: Republican Senator John McCain has also signed onto the bill. And it's worth noting that businesses in both senators' states would benefit if this bill passes.

BENINCASA: Harkins' state, Iowa, is home to a company called PMX, which makes the metal sheets that get turned into coins.

KESTENBAUM: Senator John McCain's state of Arizona is home to some big companies that mine copper, the main ingredient in dollar coins.

BENINCASA: So, that's the coin side of the fight. In the other corner, fighting for paper, you'll find an organization called Americans for George.

KESTENBAUM: Because George Washington is on the $1 bill. Americans for George put those ads in the D.C. subway and again, here you find a lot of money behind the arguments over money. Americans for George was started by the company that makes the paper the $1 bill is printed on. Crane & Company.

BENINCASA: Doug Crane is a vice president there. As you might imagine, he says paper dollars are better than coins.

DOUGLAS CRANE: A dollar bill is made from a blend of cotton and linen fiber.

KESTENBAUM: Paper bills are cheaper to manufacture than coins, he says, and they last surprisingly long. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, a $1 bill lasts about four and a half years.

CRANE: U.S. currency, you know, it's some of the most durable banknotes on the planet. And, you know, the $1 bill is probably the hardest-working note there is.

KESTENBAUM: So, what to make of this. The coin people say coins are better. The paper people say paper is better. Both cannot be true.

BENINCASA: And to make things more confusing, both sides point to the same official report to make their case.

KESTENBAUM: The report was written by the Government Accountability Office, a non-partisan arm of Congress that's often called on to settle questions like this.

BENINCASA: We talked with the GAO's Lorelei St. James who oversaw the report. The GAO has recommended switching to coins.

LORELEI ST. JAMES: That still stands.

KESTENBAUM: She says switching to coins would make the government money. Over 30 years, a lot of money.

JAMES: We show that there would be a $4.4 billion net benefit to the federal government.

KESTENBAUM: But it turns out that $4.4 billion does not come from the fact that coins are more cost effective to make. Coins do last longer, but they also cost more to manufacture. No, according to the GAO, the extra money for the government comes from this other weird thing. It's going to take us a minute to explain.

BENINCASA: It turns out if you switch from dollar bills to dollar coins, you can't just do a one for one replacement. You actually need more coins than you would bills. Why? Because people don't like carrying coins around.

JAMES: A lot of people when they take their coins out of their pockets at the end of the day or their purses, they'll put in what we call a coin jar.

KESTENBAUM: The coin jar effect. In Canada and the U.K., the governments had to put out all these extra coins, over 50 percent more, just to keep enough money circulating. The GAO says these extra coins mean extra money for the government.

BENINCASA: Because the government makes a profit from every bill or coin out there, so more coins, more profit. It's called seigniorage.

KESTENBAUM: So case closed, right? Not so fast. We're here to tell you there is something big missing from that GAO report, which is where all that money the government is getting comes from. It turns out it comes from us.

BENINCASA: To help explain how this works, and to render the final judgment, let's meet one more person, Robert Whaples. He's an economist at Wake Forest University.

KESTENBAUM: Whaples weirdly came to us via the dollar coin lobby, a group called the Dollar Coin Alliance. The Dollar Coin Alliance said make sure you talk to him; he's a pro-coin guy.

BENINCASA: So, we called Whaples up. He read the GAO report, thought about it, and he said the choice is very clear: The paper dollar wins, the coin loses.

ROBERT WHAPLES: It's clearly an inferior substitute. People are going to be putting them on top of their bureaus instead of spending them for transactions. And that seems like a big waste of resources to me.

BENINCASA: Whaples says all that money the government makes on the dollar coin, all that extra money, it doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from us.

KESTENBAUM: Think about it this way, if I have a paper dollar, I'll probably use it or put in the bank. But if stick a coin in a jar, I'm not getting anything from it. I'm not earning any interest on it. It's like we're paying a tax.

WHAPLES: That is exactly how I would see it.

KESTENBAUM: Well, but the Dollar Coin Alliance said I should talk to you because you favor the...

WHAPLES: Yeah, I guess they made a mistake.

(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: There you have it.

I'm David Kestenbaum.

BENINCASA: And I'm Robert Benincasa, NPR News.

**faster whisper:**
Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck, some nights I call it a draw.
For advanced countries as a whole, we forecast growth of 1.4 percent in 2012 and 2 percent
in 2013.
These are low numbers.
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
It's Friday, April 20th, and that was Olivier Blanchard you heard at the top.
He's the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
Today on the show, should we kill the $1 bill?
There's legislation in both the Senate and the House that would eliminate $1 bills
and replace them with dollar coins.
We ask, should we do that?
And we find a pretty clear answer.
But first, the Planet Money Indicator from you.
Today's Planet Money Indicator, 374,750.
Over the past four weeks, an average of 374,750 people per week have filed for unemployment
insurance for the first time.
Oh, that's bad.
It is bad.
And, you know, this number, it was falling, but in the past few weeks it started going
up again and it's now back to where it was in January.
This indicator, people call it initial claims, it's a good way to track basically how many
people are getting laid off, getting fired and filing for unemployment insurance.
So when this number is rising, that is bad.
Jacob, I thought like all the unemployment indicators, all these other numbers, they're
all sort of heading in the right direction.
Yeah, you know, the big picture, it's still, I think, safe to say the economy is getting
better.
If you look just at this indicator, if you look at a graph of initial unemployment
claims over the past few years, this jump that we're seeing right now, it just
looks like a little blip.
There is definitely a sense out there right now that a lot of people are nervous.
They're waiting to see whether this is, in fact, just a blip or whether, in fact,
it's an early sign that the recovery is once again slowing down.
All right, onto the show.
Dollar coins versus dollar bills.
So right now we have both of them, but as we've reported, lots of dollar coins
are sitting unused in vaults.
But maybe coins are a better option.
Maybe we should just get rid of the dollar bill and force people to use coins.
David, you and Robert Benincasa on NPR's investigative team, you've been digging
into this, and I've actually heard you on the phone for a long time now talking
to people about it.
And based on those conversations, and I mean this, I think at this point you
may know as much as anyone in America about this question.
As we said, there does seem to be a right answer here.
The debate on the surface, it's a practical one.
What's easier?
What's more convenient?
But to get to our final verdict, we are going to need to go deep into the
nature of money itself.
Before we get there, let's hear from both sides.
In one corner, arguing for coins, we have Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat from Iowa.
His pitch involves a vending machine in the basement of some Senate building.
At least that's where I think this video is shot.
Has this ever happened to you?
You try to put a dollar bill in and it's regular, it won't take it.
Well that's why I've introduced bipartisan legislation to replace the dollar bill
with a dollar coin.
I talked to Senator Harkin and vending machines aside, he says, it's a no-brainer.
Coins last a lot longer than bills.
The most important thing is that it's just more efficient.
It's way more efficient than a paper dollar.
Dollar coins last something like 30 years.
He says switching to coins would save hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
And Harkin is ready with a long list of countries that have already made the
switch.
Europe has the euro with a coin worth more than a dollar.
So do Japan and Australia.
Canada has a coin that's worth $2.
England has a coin worth about $3 US.
Switzerland has one worth about $5 US.
And yet, what have we got?
We got a 25-cent piece.
All right, so that's the argument in favor of coins.
And it is not just Senator Harkin making the case.
The super committee, remember, that was trying to cut the deficit, the
super committee was considering switching to dollar coins.
The Washington Post just wrote an editorial favoring coins.
In the Senate, Harkin has a very powerful co-sponsor, John McCain, the
Republican from Arizona.
And just for the sake of thoroughness here, we should point out that both
Harkin and McCain come from states with businesses that would benefit if
this bill passes.
McCain State of Arizona, it's the largest producer in the country of
copper, which is the main ingredient in dollar coins.
There are big mining companies working in Arizona.
And then Iowa, Harkin State, it's home to a company called PMX, which
makes the metal sheets that get turned into coins.
Harkin says he supported the dollar coin before PMX got into the business.
McCain wouldn't talk to us for the story.
Just to recap the arguments on the pro-coin side, point one, vending
machines, point two, they last longer and will save a bunch of money.
Point three, lots of other countries are doing it.
Now let's hear from the paper people.
All right, in the other corner, fighting for paper, meet Douglas
Crane, and I will say he has a strong financial interest here also.
He is vice president at Crane and Company, which makes the very
paper that the U.S.
one dollar bill is printed on.
A dollar bill is made from a blend of cotton and linen fiber.
That's surprising to me.
I never knew that, you know, it's almost like it's a t-shirt or something.
Well, it is.
And, you know, these textile fibers happen to make extremely
strong and extraordinarily durable paper.
Doug Crane is not a fan of coins.
He told me he was buying a train ticket from a machine
recently and he got change in dollar coins.
I was just crestfallen when I started hearing the clunking of the
change coming down through the machine.
It really wasn't a good feeling.
Doug's company has spent some money fighting this battle.
His company started an organization called Americans for George
because George Washington is on the one dollar bill.
Americans for George recently plastered a subway station in
Washington, D.C. with ads defending the honor of the dollar bill.
I don't know how often senators and congressmen ride the subway in
D.C., but their staff certainly do.
U.S. currency. It's, you know, some of the most durable banknotes on
the planet. And the one dollar bill is probably the hardest
working note there is.
Here's what Doug Crane says.
Dollar bills, they are really tough.
They last on average four and a half years and it's cheaper to
make a bill than a coin.
In fact, he ticked off all the arguments his opponents on the
coin side make and he said those arguments are simply wrong.
Coins, he says, are not more cost effective.
They do not save money.
That is all wrong, wrong, wrong.
This is what drives me insane about it.
We've got kind of a problem here.
Coin people say coins are better.
Paper people say paper is better.
Both cannot be right.
Two will enter. Only one will leave.
I think what we need now is a neutral party.
We need a referee to help us evaluate the claims from both
sides. And fortunately, we have a neutral party.
The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress, which is often called upon to settle debates just like
this one. They have a report on this very question and it has
some useful numbers in it.
Start with this.
A dollar coin, according to the report, it costs about 15
cents to make.
It lasts a little more than 30 years.
So it costs about half a cent per year.
All right. Now let's do the dollar bill.
The GAO says it costs two point seven cents to make a
bill. That's much cheaper than the coin.
But it doesn't last as long. It lasts four and a half years.
Do the math. That's about point six cents a year to have a
bill out there.
OK. So coins cost half a cent a year to have out there.
Bills cost a little more point six cents a year.
That would seem to say coins save money.
Coins win.
Except for this one weird thing we haven't mentioned
yet. It turns out that if you replace dollar bills with
dollar coins, you can't just do a one to one replacement.
Turns out you need more coins than you would bills because
people don't like to carry coins around.
Here's Lorelei St.
James with the GAO.
She oversaw the report.
A lot of people when they take their coins out of their
pockets at the end of the day or their purses, they'll
put it in what we call a coin jar.
You can call this the coin jar effect, the sock drawer
effect, whatever.
It is well documented.
The GAO looked at Canada and the UK and found that when
those countries switched to coins, they had to put all
these extra coins out there over 50 percent more.
And this changes the math entirely because if you
switch to coins, you have to pay to manufacture 50
percent more coins that are just going to sit around
in coin jars.
All of a sudden, you're spending a lot more than
you thought. And once you take the coin jar effect
into account, paper dollars look like a better
deal than coins.
The GAO says that's correct.
If you only looked at the cost of production, then
you would say, well, the note would be more
economical.
So just to be clear, this means switching to coins
would cost money.
Paper is the cheaper option.
And yet this is the really crazy thing.
The GAO recommends switching to coins.
That still stands.
Why does the GAO recommend switching to coins?
The answer in just one jargony word is
seniorage.
Seniorage is profit the government makes by
creating money.
So seniorage is a very strange thing.
And I guarantee most people in our government
do not understand how it actually works.
But after listening to this, you will.
Let's walk through it.
I'll play the role of the Federal Reserve, the
magical place with the power to create U.S.
dollars.
Say I'm going to use my magic to put a dollar
bill out into the world.
First, I have to pay to get the dollar bill
made. That cost me two point seven cents.
Now I, the Fed, I actually have this dollar bill
in my hand. I have to get it out there into the
world. And the way I do that is I buy something
with this dollar bill.
Usually what I buy is a bond.
Well, how fortunate. I happen to have a bond
here. I would like to sell you.
All right. Let's do the deal.
You have my dollar. I have your bond.
So now that dollar bill is out in the world.
And I, the Federal Reserve, I have this bond.
And of course, bonds pay interest.
So you have this interest coming into me, coming
into the Federal Reserve.
This money piles up and pretty soon I have some
extra money sitting around.
That extra money sitting around, that is
seniorage. And every year, the Fed turns the
extra money over to the government.
And this is why the GAO recommends switching
to coins, because the more dollars that are
out there in the world, the more seniorage the
government gets. Each dollar out there in the
world, it earns the government a little bit of
extra money. And remember the coin jar effect.
When you switch to coins, you have to put all
these extra dollars out there.
More dollars out there means more seniorage.
We show that there would be a four point four
billion dollar net benefit to the federal
government if the government switched from
the dollar note to the dollar coin.
And that's over a 30 year time period.
Just to recap, according to the GAO,
dollar bills are cheaper, but coins make more
money for the government.
More money for the government may sound good,
but I'm here to tell you the GAO report leaves
out something huge, which is that that four
point four billion dollars, it is not free
money that magically appeared from nowhere.
It turns out it comes from somewhere.
It comes from us.
It comes from everybody with extra coins in
sock drawers or between the sofa cushions
or in a coin jar like this one.
Hang on. I have to get it.
This is Robert Smith, our colleague's coin jar.
Wait, it's a it's a big paper box full of
coins. And wait, there's more.
So every day Robert Smith goes out and buys
lunch. He gets some change in coins and
every day he sticks it in a box.
Probably hundreds of dollars here and it's
hundreds of dollars that Robert Smith is not
doing anything with.
He's not spending it.
And more importantly, he doesn't have it in a
savings account.
He's not investing it.
He's not earning any interest off of it.
It's not earning anything from it.
Robert Smith is clearly losing out here and
Robert Smith's loss.
It's the government's gain.
These coins are hundreds of extra dollars
that the government gets to collect seniorage
from. So I've talked to a bunch of
economists about this who said this is just
an economic fact.
It's not something you can really debate.
Seniorage isn't real savings.
It's just moving money from people to the
government in this really sloppy, inefficient
way. And when you realize this, the case
for dollar coins, it doesn't look very
good. Though when Robert Benincasa and I
were working on the story, I got an email
from the Dollar Coin Lobbying Group, a
group called the Dollar Coin Alliance.
Dollar Coin Alliance said, wait, if you
want to do a balanced report, you should
talk to some pro coin economists about this
stuff. I said talk to Robert Waples at
Wake Forest University.
So I called Waples up, ready for one more
pro coin argument.
Waples read the GAO report.
He thought about it and he said, the
answer is very clear, coins lose.
It's clearly an inferior substitute.
People are going to be putting them on
top of their bureaus instead of
spending them for transactions.
And that seems like a big waste of
resources to me.
He basically said what we've said here.
The additional money for the government,
it is not free money.
It comes from us.
It's effectively a tax on people who
hold coins in jars at home.
That is exactly how I would see it.
But the Dollar Coin Alliance said I
should talk to you because you favored
the dollar.
I guess they made a mistake.
All right, Kirsten Baum, you now
know as much about this subject as
anybody in America.
You know probably more than anybody
should know about it.
Bottom line, coin or bill?
The dollar bill wins.
In case you were wondering about why
so many other countries have switched
to coins, the answer seems to be
that their paper currency did
not last as long as ours does.
We were able to locate the report
that laid out the arguments for the
Canadian loonie, Canada's one dollar
coin. The report says, among other
things, that the paper one dollar
Canadian bill, it only lasted a
year. The U.S. dollar lasts four
and a half times longer.
We'll post that report online as
well as the video of Senator
Harkin at the vending machine.
That'll all be at NPR.org slash
money. I'm David Kirsten Baum
and I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Thanks for listening.
Like you told me, pass rules
everything around me.
Singing dollar, dollar bill,
y'all.
