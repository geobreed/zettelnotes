Gift-giving makes economists crazy. It's so inefficient! So we wondered: Is there a way to make the holiday season both more efficient and more joyful? On today's Planet Money, we try to answer that question by conducting a wildly unscientific experiment. We go into a seventh-grade classroom and give a bunch of kids some small gifts — candy, raisins, fig newtons. Then we ask them how much they value what they got, and if they can think of a way to make everyone better off, without buying any more gifts. They quickly arrive at a solution: trade. Behold, the power of economics!

**faster whisper:**
I think some people perceive me as attacking Christmas, which I never meant to.
Just the sloppy way that we celebrate it.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Caitlin Kenney.
Today is Tuesday, December 25th.
That was economist Joel Waldfogel you heard at the top.
On the show today, we bring a bag full of candy into a seventh grade classroom to try to solve
a holiday economic puzzle that has been bugging people like Joel Waldfogel for years.
Just a note for loyal Planet Money listeners, this show originally aired in December of
2010.
Ok, so Christmas and the holiday season is supposed to be a happy, joyful time of year.
Economists though, don't necessarily feel that way.
Because once you learn about economics, it's hard to appreciate this time of year.
You see all these problems.
That economist you heard at the top, Joel Waldfogel, he gets particularly upset
this time of year.
Why?
Because of this problem called deadweight loss.
What's deadweight loss?
It's this.
Hey, my name is Sadre.
I actually got, this is kind of silly, but I got a Power Ranger.
Like a big old Power Ranger toy.
I was kind of angry because I really hate Power Rangers.
I was like, what is this?
My name is Angelica and last year my mom got me a Barbie.
I didn't want it and I was like, I'm too old for it.
Think about it this way.
Normally if you buy something for yourself, say a sweater or a Power Ranger, you're buying
it because if the Power Ranger cost $20, you'd rather have the Power Ranger than the $20.
It's worth at least that amount of money to you, so you gain in the transaction.
But Waldfogel says that's not usually the case with gift giving, because someone
else is buying it for you and they don't necessarily know what you want.
I could spend $50 and buy something that's worth nothing to you.
So say for example, you bought me a $50 toaster for Christmas.
I don't need a toaster, I don't really have room for one in my Christmas.
You're saying that's just a drain on the economy, just lost money.
Well yeah, particularly if I buy you a toaster and you don't need it, so you
stick it in a closet and that's where it stays forever.
Something cost real resources, so you know, some elves, so to speak, had to
make that toaster.
But if it generates no use and no satisfaction for anyone, then it's just pure waste.
This may seem like who cares?
This only happens once a year.
It's a big deal if I didn't want a toaster and I got one.
But Waldfogel has done a bunch of research on this.
He wrote a book, Screw Genomics, Why You Shouldn't Buy Presents for the Holidays,
and he estimates that US holiday gift giving destroys about $13 billion worth of value.
That's $13 billion worth of toasters and closets, ties that don't match
anything you own, books you're not going to read.
Recently, David Kestenbaum and I were talking about this problem, about deadweight
loss.
David had an idea.
He wanted to see if we could make Christmas more joyful by making it more efficient.
David being a scientist, he wanted to do an experiment.
So in search of an answer, we went to a seventh grade classroom at the Lions Community
School just across the river in Brooklyn.
That's where we met Tadre, the kid you heard from with the unwanted Power Ranger.
We got there pretty early in the morning, just around 8 a.m., and we're in this
classroom that looks a lot like you expect.
There's something on every inch of the wall.
There's a map, whiteboard, results of the most recent science experiments they'd done.
So we started our experiment doing what the economist Joel Waldfogel hates.
We gave out gifts to the kids, people we don't know at all, and we gave out
the gifts in the most inefficient way possible, randomly.
We just had this bag with 10 pieces of candy.
We line up the kids, we walk down the line, and we give each of them a piece
of candy completely at random.
And mostly the kids just stare at the things in their hands.
They're checking out what they have and what their neighbors are holding.
But some pieces of candy, like the box of Sour Patch Kids, were really big hits.
Oh, you lucky.
Some other things we hand out, though, they are not so popular.
Something wrong with Fig Newtons?
Oh.
It's a box of raisins.
Oh, I hate raisins.
Besides the Sour Patch Kids, Fig Newtons, and raisins, we gave out Nerds,
Mike and Ikes, Three Musketeers, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Twix,
Sweet Tarts, and Swedish Fish.
10 candies in total.
So, Caitlin, when you and our production assistant, Jess,
were trying to figure out what to buy, I overheard way too much talk.
Jess was down the street at the drugstore calling back,
should I get Mike and Ikes?
Or I want something they don't like.
They should get raisins.
Oh no, they're totally going to hate Sweet Tarts.
Yeah, we had a lot of fun with this, I have to say.
All right, so once we'd handed these things out, we wanted to measure.
We wanted to measure how much wealth we have out there in this scenario.
So we did this the way economists might do it.
We asked the kids, how much do you value what you have in your hands?
Look around and give us a number from 0 to 10.
How happy are you with what you got?
My name is Genesee and I got Mike and Ike.
And it's a zero because I don't eat these.
All right, Mike and Ike gets a zero.
My name is Donate and I got a three musketeers bar.
And I put up a five because I like them but not that much.
My name is Michael and I got nerds.
And I'll put a two because I don't really like these.
My name is Justin James and I put a zero because I don't like figs.
One kid has been writing these numbers down on the board as we go
in very neat handwriting.
And then we add them up.
Collectively, we got 50.
Total wealth, 50.
And this is an important number.
It's how much value there is in this room at this moment.
But I got to say, it seems low to me.
Why?
Because before we came in, these kids had nothing.
And we just handed them this candy.
For free.
Right, without them doing anything.
We didn't ask them to answer any questions or solve any math problems.
We just handed it over.
And they're like, yeah, zero, one.
Right, it seems so bizarre.
What kid doesn't love candy?
This is what Joel Waldfogel, the economist,
is saying is the problem with gifts.
Even a gift, even something you get for free,
you may not value it very much.
It makes you think, if we could make the holidays more efficient,
we could make everyone much happier.
Because on average, right now, everyone in this classroom,
they're basically at a five.
So we wanted to find a way to fix this.
And we asked the kids, what can we do?
Without bringing anything new into this classroom,
is it possible to make all of you happier,
to increase the total wealth?
Here's the first answer we got, completely unedited,
from Joshua Felician.
So how can we make that number go higher?
To appreciate it.
Do something that, like, oh my god, give it around.
Probably trade and stuff like that.
Trade.
So what I love is that in just 11.8 seconds,
Joshua Felician, seventh grader,
has proposed creating a marketplace.
One of the most important economic innovations
in human history.
You see it pop up throughout civilization.
Here, it takes just 11.8 seconds.
And it makes sense.
These kids probably don't have jobs.
Most of the money they get probably
comes from their parents.
And so they can't just go out and buy things.
It makes sense when you're in this sort of seventh grade,
pre-money world.
You trade.
Kids trade things all the time.
They trade baseball cards, toys, Halloween candy.
In fact, literally within seconds of us
handing out the candy to the kids,
before you ask them their ideas about what we could do,
I heard them whisper to each other, hey, you want to trade?
So that's what we decided to let them do.
You've seen what everyone has, right?
I'm going to give you, I think, 60 seconds.
OK, you'll have one minute to trade.
And it has to be mutual.
So you know, you can't force anyone to trade.
The other person's got to be willing to trade.
So all right.
Ready?
Go.
And Caitlin, all of a sudden, it
is like we are on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
It's like everyone's swapping corn futures contracts.
You want to trade?
Sweet fish.
What?
You want?
You want?
No, all right.
I've got nerves.
I've got nerves.
Yeah, I've got nerves.
All of a sudden, there's this frenzy of activity.
Everyone is clustering together.
One kid just holds a Twix bar up over his head.
So anyone who wants it can just run over to him.
A minute later, we stop the trading.
OK, I think we're done.
So everyone gets back in line.
And now we want to see if the trading has increased
the wealth in the room.
So we go down the line again.
And we ask everyone to value what they have now.
Give us a number again from 0 to 10.
My name is Genesee, and I've got cell patches.
And it's a 10 because I love cell patches.
And what were you before?
A 0.
So you went from a 0 to a 10.
Yeah.
My name is Donne, and I have nerds now.
And I give it a 9, because they taste really good to me.
And what did you have before?
I had three musketeers, and I had a 5.
My name is Justin.
I traded a fig for raisins.
So now it was a 0 to a 1.
It's not bad.
From fig newtons to raisins is a 0 to a 1.
OK.
My name is Nicholas Heaven.
I got fig newton bars.
And I put an 8, because as you see the picture,
it looks OK.
But I never ate newton bars, so I put an 8.
So we start to total up the numbers.
First, we're trying to do it in our heads,
and we all end up with different figures.
But eventually, we converge.
The total wealth in the room is now 82.
And we started with 50.
So magically, without bringing anything new into the room,
without buying more candy, without consuming
any electricity, without elves having to work overtime,
just 60 seconds of letting people trade,
our classroom wealth has gone from 50 up to 82,
from an average of 5 to an average of 8.2.
Behold the amazing power of economics.
And I tell this to the class.
I try to tell them.
That's why countries trade with each other.
That's why you have commerce.
That's why we have money.
Because without doing any extra work,
except 60 seconds of walking around
with your candy in the air, you
can increase the happiness by a lot in this case.
My little speech didn't get much of a reaction.
I know.
But David, we were really popular up until this point.
Yeah.
We just walked in and handed them candy.
They loved us.
And I think at this point, they were just
waiting for us to stop talking so they could actually eat it.
To be fair, I think this idea that trading sort of increases
wealth is one of those things that falls somewhere
between being very basic and very profound.
I mean, there's part of you that goes, duh,
because this is what we live and breathe every day.
This is the economy that we live in.
But there's also part of you that goes, oh, you know,
I never quite thought of it that way.
We wanted to know what Mr. Scroogeonomics himself
thought of our experiment.
So we called Joel Waldfogel back.
And we read him his holiday wish from last year,
that everyone have a happy but efficient holiday season.
Do you remember saying that last year?
That sounds like something I would say.
So I agree with it.
Still?
Yes.
And we told him about our experiment,
how we randomly handed out candy to the kids in Brooklyn.
Then we said, well, what can we
do to make that number go up to make this more efficient?
You're laughing.
I'm laughing because I've done this.
I did this at my daycare when my kids were like two and four.
Anyways, I'm loving this.
Go ahead.
So we tell him that then we let the kids trade.
And the happiness went from 50 to 82.
You know, I love this story.
It's like it maps one to one into the story.
I always tell.
But then I say to the kids,
you know what this is?
This is efficiency.
And that really gets them excited.
No, they're totally glazed over.
But the point is, there's no more stuff here,
but there's more happiness.
That's efficiency.
So tell us your story.
Well, so there are two versions of it.
Literally, the candy one was with my nieces
when they were four and six.
And it was the dregs of the Halloween candy.
And I said, well, could you just rank order those
from your most to least favorite?
And the two kids had different rank orderings.
So I engineered some trades.
But then the little one started to cry.
And the older one said, Uncle Joel, is this economics?
But the happier version of the story,
is when I did it at the daycare with coloring book pages,
and I brought two kids up and gave them things
I think they didn't want.
And I said, what can we do to make them more happy?
And some kids suggested they could exchange.
But then I just randomly handed out a bunch of stuff.
Now again, these were like four and six year old,
or no, younger.
These were like three and five.
And there again, kids started to cry.
Because they got things they didn't want?
Exactly.
Like, kid, you had nothing.
Now you have something.
You could trade it.
But they were crying.
And so I learned.
My point about the candy.
These kids were just giving them a five.
And I was saying, hey, wait, you had no candy
before we walked in here this morning.
The thing that's nice, so great about your experiment,
is you did it with kids old enough
that they could actually do the trading.
I learned that economics kind of worked only
for kids who were maybe 10 and over.
It's probably not surprising that us adults
have figured out ways to deal with the inefficiency
of the holiday season.
That's why parents intercept letters from Santa.
That's why we have gift cards.
That's why we have gift receipts
and generous return policies.
Then we gon' hit the mall
I'm like Bad Santa though
Even though we ain't ballin'
We glad to sit on my lap
Feel like we bought it all
The mistletoe's right here
As always, we'd love to hear
what you thought of the show today.

I'm Caitlin Kenny.
Thanks for listening.
I'm a family that I'm sorry that I gotta stay
I'm with Ye at the Macy Day Parade
Letting the snow fall on my aviator shades
Even though I'm in New York,
I'm still reppin' for the A
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin' it all in
Then we gon' hit the mall
