Thomas Peterffy's life story includes a typing robot, a proto-iPad, and a vast fortune he amassed as one of the first guys to use computers in financial markets. On today's show, Peterffy tells us his story — and he explains why he's worried about the financial world he helped create. We learned of Peterffy's story from the forthcoming book Automate This.

First, three stories from Thomas Peterffy's life as a trader:

Story #1:

When Peterffy was a kid growing up in communist Hungary in the 1950s his buddy went to Austria and brought back a pack of Juicy Fruit gum. Peterffy bought the pack, broke the sticks of gum up into little pieces, and sold them at a profit. The principal at his school was not amused. "Where's your communist conscience?" the principal asked.

Not surprisingly, given story #1, Peterffy moved to the U.S. as a young man.

Story #2:

By the 1970s, Peterffy was working at a company trying to use computers to make money on Wall Street. (This was a novel idea at the time.)

Peterffy figured out how to use computers to calculate when financial instruments called options were overpriced or underpriced. But he had a problem. It was 1977, and people weren't yet using computers to buy and sell options. They were still standing in trading pits, waving their arms and yelling to do trades.

Peterffy tried bringing binders of computer printouts to the trading floor to guide his buying and selling. But this was slow and inefficient. So he and some engineers tried to build an early tablet computer — a proto-iPad — to bring to the trading floor. The tablet worked, though one burst into flames on the trading floor.

Story #3:

It wasn't until 1987 that Peterffy was able to take people out of the loop entirely. With the world's first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal, traders could type in orders directly into a computer.

Peterffy didn't want to type in the orders. He and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal and wired it up to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.

A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy's setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy's group one week to fix the problem.

Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard. It satisfied the NASDAQ rules. And on active trading days, the robot typed so fast it sounded like a machine gun.

In the 1990s, over a decade after Peterffy dreamed up computerized trading, exchanges start to let people plug their computers directly into the markets.

'Absolutely No Social Value'

Today, Peterffy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion.

Peterffy says automation has done some very good things for the world. It's made buying and selling stocks much much cheaper for everyone.

But Peterffy thinks the race for speed is doing more harm than good now. "We are competing at milliseconds," he says. "And whether you can shave three milliseconds of an order, has absolutely no social value."

Peterffy is in favor of more regulation. He'd like to see rules that slow things down.

The challenge of course: People will try to find ways around the rules. There is always someone willing to build a robot that types.

Note: We learned of Peterffy's story from the forthcoming book Automate This.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

From NPR News this ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

And I'm Melissa Block. By one estimate half of all stock trades now involve a computer which decides on its own to buy or sell. Computerized trading has helped markets function more efficiently, but it's also led to some spectacular messes. Just this month, one firm suddenly lost $440 million dollars because of a computer glitch. NPR's David Kestenbaum of Planet Money visited one of the fathers of computerized trading to explore how he got to this point.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Thomas Petterfy grew up in Hungary after World War II. His first experience with trading happened when he was around 12. A friend went across the border to Austria and brought back something truly precious.

THOMAS PETTERFY: Juicy Fruit gum. These are beautiful yellow, Juicy Fruit gum sticks.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy cut each stick into five small pieces, and sold the pieces to his friends at school for a profit.

PETTERFY: Eventually, the principal found out about this and called me down into his office and he said, well, where is your Communist conscience? And I didn't know what he was talking about.

KESTENBAUM: Was that your first time buying low and selling high?

PETTERFY: That is correct.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy eventually makes his way to the United States, where he meets his first computer - a big boxy, calculator of a thing - and he falls in love, stays up all night programming it. And eventually, gets a job at a company that is trying to use computers and math to make money on Wall Street. In particular there are these complicated things called options or derivatives. They give you the right to buy, say, a certain stock at a certain price on a specific date. It's hard to calculate what one should cost, but Petterfy, with a computer, he finds a kind of secret formula.

PETTERFY: It took me about nine months to figure this out. But once I figured it out, it was a fantastic feeling.

KESTENBAUM: Because it meant there was a way to price them.

PETTERFY: That's right.

KESTENBAUM: And a way to make money. But this is 1977, and Petterfy has a problem. Trading isn't done on computers. You have to go stand in a pit on a trading floor and wave your hands around and shout. Petterfy can't bring his computer onto the floor, so he prints out mathematical tables on paper and puts the pages in a big binder. He brings this big binder down onto the trading floor.

PETTERFY: People looked at me - what the heck is that? And so I said, well, you know, these are my numbers that will help me trade hopefully. They made funny faces and, you know, many of them didn't understand my accent and it was - I didn't feel very welcome there.

KESTENBAUM: Every time Petterfy tries to use computers to trade, it's like the world just isn't ready for it yet. He hires some engineers who help him build these early tablet computers which work - though one burst into flames on the trading floor. It isn't until 1987 that Petterfy finally is able to take people out of the loop entirely. It happens at NASDAQ, the world's first electronic stock exchange. Meaning, there is no trading floor. You buy and sell by typing orders into a computer - a NASDAQ terminal. Petterfy, of course, doesn't want to have to type in orders. So, he and his engineers hack into the terminal. They wire it up to their computer, which starts trading up a storm; so many trades that a high up official with NASDAQ comes by to see what's going on. And the guy sees just this one terminal attached to a computer.

PETTERFY: He looks and looks and looks and he says, well, so tell me again how you are doing this? So I explained to him what's happening here. And then he says, I don't think you can do this, but I really don't think, but let me go back to my office and let you know.

KESTENBAUM: The man calls back and says I'm sorry. The NASDAQ rule book says you can't go cutting wires. All orders have to be entered through the keyboard. You have one week to fix it.

PETTERFY: So this was a problem.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy and his engineers come up with a solution. Trades have to be entered on the keyboard? Fine. They build a machine to do that.

PETTERFY: So it was basically they were rubber fingers that were typing.

KESTENBAUM: You built a robot to type in the trades.

PETTERFY: We built a robot that types.

KESTENBAUM: What did that thing sound like when it was running?

PETTERFY: Like a machine gun. Brrrrr. Because it was typing so fast.

KESTENBAUM: Finally, in the 1990s exchanges started to let people just plug their computers directly into the markets. Today, Petterfy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion dollars. Petterfy says automation has done some very good things for the world. It's made buying and selling stocks much, much cheaper for everyone. But Petterfy thinks this race for speed, it's doing more harm than good now. It's an arms race, like the U.S. had with the Soviets.

PETTERFY: We are competing at milliseconds. And whether you can shave off three milliseconds in the execution of an order has absolutely no social value.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy is in favor of more regulation. Rules that will build in some safeguards and slow things down. The challenge, of course, people will try to find ways around those rules. There's always somebody willing to build a robot that types. David Kestenbaum, NPR News.

**faster whisper:**
The whole thing happened so fast that if you ducked out for a cup of coffee, you could have
missed it entirely.
The financial world for a moment became unglued.
It was May 6, 2010, at 2.32 p.m., a trader working in the mutual fund business issued
an order to sell some investments.
It was a large amount, $4.1 billion worth, so the trader decided to do it gradually.
The trader used a computer program, a computer algorithm, that would sell the investments
bit by bit, so it wouldn't disturb the markets.
There was, we now know, a flaw in that computer program.
In a matter of minutes, stock markets and financial markets looked like they were going
into freefall.
It's hard to capture that on radio, but there is one guy who does an audio play-by-play
for people who want to listen in, usually in the background, to what's going on
in the markets.
This is Ben Lichtenstein of Traders Audio.
The time is 2.42 p.m.
Some things looked momentarily worthless, trading for just a penny.
Others went crazy high, selling for $100,000.
And then, just as quickly, everything went back to normal.
A rift in the space-time continuum that healed itself.
This came to be known as the flash crash.
The Securities and Exchange Commission later issued a 104-page report, which reconstructed
the events of that day.
It turned out the problem wasn't just one flawed computer algorithm.
It was that that trader's computer, when it was selling those investments, it was selling
to other computers run by other algorithms.
The result was a mess.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today is Tuesday, August 21st, 2012.
David, that flash crash that you just described, it was this wake-up call when all of a
sudden, lots of people saw that the markets are now largely driven by computers that
are buying and selling to each other.
And they're just doing whatever those algorithms tell them to do.
And sometimes, those algorithms go haywire.
Today on the show, we meet a man, one of the fathers of computerized trading,
who tells us the truly crazy story of how he got here.
And we ask him what he thinks of this world that he helped create.
The man you're going to meet, his name is Thomas Pederfi, and I read about him in this
new book that just came out, Automate This by Christopher Steiner.
It's one of those books you think you're just going to skim, but then you have to
keep reading and reading.
Pederfi's story was so amazing that I went to talk to him.
And I asked him to start at the beginning.
And he started right at the beginning.
Pederfi was born in the middle of World War II, in the middle of the actual
war in Budapest.
He was born in the basement of a hospital because of the shelling.
He grew up in a building that was partly bombed out.
His first real experience with trading happened when he was around 12 years old.
A friend of his went across the border to Austria and brought back something truly precious.
Juicy fruit gum.
These were beautiful yellow juicy fruit gum sticks.
And so he sold them to me for two forints, which was the Hungarian currency, per stick.
Pederfi takes the gum.
He cuts each stick into five small pieces.
He sells the pieces to his friends in school for one forint each, making a little profit
for himself.
Now, Hungary was communist at the time, and this did not go over well at school.
And soon enough, the teachers noticed in the school that all the kids were sitting
around chewing gum.
And of course, eventually the principal found out about this and called me down
into his office.
And he said, well, where is your communist conscience?
And I didn't know what he was talking about.
He didn't like the profiteering, he didn't like the gum itself, he didn't like anything.
Was that your first time buying low and selling high?
That is correct.
Pederfi eventually makes it out of Hungary.
He finds a way to get to the United States.
He speaks almost no English.
This is 1965, he lives here in New York in a Hungarian neighborhood on the East Side.
And he gets a job as a draftsman at an engineering firm, which is where he meets his first computer.
It's basically a primitive calculator, but for Pederfi, this is love at first sight.
He stays up all night programming it.
And that finally puts Pederfi at the place where he will shape history, the
financial markets.
He begins working for a trading firm that's interested in using computers.
David, this is really a pivotal moment in the history of the market.
You know, it's the early 1970s.
Computers are no longer the size of a whole room.
They're cheap enough that an ordinary company can buy one.
And you have people on Wall Street starting to say, hey, maybe a computer can help me
figure out how to make money in the market.
And Pederfi focuses on using the computer to try and make money in the options market.
So options are what we call derivatives.
When you buy an option on, say, a stock, you don't buy the actual stock.
What you're buying is a guarantee that you can buy that stock at a certain price, at
a specific date in the future.
It's like, whoa, what should that thing cost, right?
It's like some weird insurance policy.
It's going to depend on the stock price now, on how far off that future date is,
on how much the price of the stock moves around.
So figuring out what the price of an option should be, that involves math.
And at the time, Pederfi says, no one was really using math.
So the prices for these things were all over the place.
I mean, nobody really knew what they were doing.
In other words, the numbers were, you know,
fairly had nothing to do with the real value of options.
Pederfi starts trying to figure out a way to calculate what these options
should cost.
He runs little simulations in a computer.
If I sold someone this option at price X, how often does it end up being
worth more than X, how often less than X?
What is a fair price for it?
It took me about nine months to figure this out.
But once I figured it out, it was a fantastic feeling.
Because it meant there was a way to price them.
That's right.
David, we should point out here, Pederfi is not the only person
at this time who's trying to do this.
In fact, a couple economists went on to win a Nobel Prize for some
related work they did on options pricing around the time.
But this idea, it was not yet widespread.
And anyone who had worked out the math had a huge advantage.
It's like imagine that the markets are a whole bunch of people
standing around trying to guess how much something weighs.
And Pederfi, he's got a scale.
The formula tells him what a reasonable price for an option should be.
So then he can look at the market and see, oh, that one's trading
for $18.
It should be worth more.
It should be $20.
And if he sees one that's cheap, he can buy it.
If one's overpriced, he can sell it.
And this is the beginning of how Pederfi makes his fortune.
And I should say here, it is substantial.
As of 2012, Forbes estimates his net worth is over $5.4 billion.
But at this point in our story, it's 1977.
Pederfi is not yet rich.
He has his secret formula.
But he's got a problem.
And it's a big one.
At this moment, trading isn't really done by a computer.
It happens in the physical world.
There's a big trading pit here in New York.
And you actually have to be standing there on the floor
to buy or sell options.
And the pit, it's a mob scene.
Pederfi can't bring his computer with the formula in it
onto the trading floor with him.
So he comes up with a plan.
He has the computer do the math in advance.
And he prints out all these tables on paper
so he can look up what a price should be for a particular option
selling at such and such a price.
He puts the tables in a big three-ring binder.
And he brings the binder down onto the trading floor with him.
So you have to imagine the scene.
There's this Hungarian guy with a strange accent
walks onto the trading floor with this big binder
full of numbers.
People looked at me.
What the heck is that?
And so I said, well, these are my numbers
that will help me trade, hopefully.
They made funny faces.
And many of them didn't understand my accent.
And it was very, I didn't feel very welcome there.
But they thought I was a goon of some sort.
And after a few days, the folks in charge
tell him, you can't have this big binder on the floor.
It's too crowded there as it is.
So I started to fold up my papers
and put them in the various pockets.
And by the end of the day, I looked like a madman
with all these papers hanging out of all of my pockets.
And I had to always wear a jacket.
So I had enough pockets to put my various papers.
The pocket thing, it works OK.
He makes some money.
But it's slow going.
And just think about really how slow it is,
how crude his setup is.
He has to get all this data and enter it
into the computer by hand.
He has to type it in.
Then the computer does its calculations,
spits out these tables.
Petter Fee has to put the tables in his pockets.
He's always got to be pulling out the tables
on the trading floor.
And then he's got to wave his hands around and actually
buy and sell the stuff from other people on the floor.
And really, there is no need for him
to be involved at all, right?
His dream is to have a computer handle everything.
He can just sit back and watch the money pile up.
But for that to happen, he needs
to overcome two obstacles.
First, he needs a way to get the data, all the prices
from the markets, into the computer
so it can do its calculations.
These are still really early days
for getting a live data stream.
But there are these things called Quotron machines
that you could buy.
I actually remember seeing one of these in an office
at a bank when I was a kid.
It was a keyboard attached to one
of those early boxy computer monitors where
the text was all in green.
It was basically the first replacement
for the paper ticker that would cluck, cluck, cluck,
cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, right?
Actually tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
That's why it was called a ticker.
You'd type in the stock you're interested in
to the Quotron machine, like DD for DuPont.
And the machine would tell you what the current stock price was.
It was amazing.
Pederfi thought, this is great.
And in 1982, he buys one of these machines.
He gets it wired up.
Now he's got these live stock prices in green on the screen.
But remember, he needs a way to get the stock
prices into his computer so it can do all the fancy math.
So he reads through the contract for his Quotron machine.
He checks that there's no restrictions on what you can
actually do with your Quotron machine.
And then he cuts the cable that
goes into the back of the Quotron machine,
the cable that's carrying all the information
about the stock prices.
And he wires that cable directly into his computer.
It takes a while.
He has to hire some people to help.
But eventually it works.
He'd hacked into the data stream.
And now his computer could crunch the data instantly.
Pederfi didn't have to enter all the prices
by hand anymore.
And this really is another key moment.
I mean, we take for granted today that sure,
you can go to any computer, your computer,
and look up the price of any stock.
But Pederfi, in order to do this,
he had to hack into the Quotron system.
He actually had to cut the cable
and bolt it into his computer.
Yeah, today you would just type in the stock.
He had to get an oscilloscope and a soldering iron,
all this stuff.
So now he can get the data in.
But to act on it, to buy or sell options,
that still has to happen manually.
So he hires a bunch of traders.
And he works on a clever system
so they don't have to carry around pieces of paper.
He and his engineers build what are kind of proto iPads,
tablet computers that will tell the traders
what to buy and sell.
I saw one of these things in his office.
It looks like something that might have flown
on an early moon mission.
It's this like metal box screwed together.
It's got a touchscreen on top.
It looks very experimental.
And it was.
There were problems.
Like they were driven by lithium batteries
and one of the boxes exploded on the trading floor.
You know, it went up in big smoke
and people said, this is dangerous.
So Petter Fee here is using computers to trade, sort of.
But it's definitely not yet computerized trading.
He still has to have people with these exploding proto
iPads who have to go wave their arms around
and holler in the trading pit.
And Petter Fee is still dreaming of the day
when he can finally take these traders out of the loop.
This finally happens in 1987 at NASDAQ.
The NASDAQ Stock Exchange is the world's first electronic
market, meaning there is no trading floor.
You buy and sell by typing orders into a computer,
a NASDAQ terminal.
Petter Fee is psyched.
He gets himself a NASDAQ terminal.
His team does their hacking again, cuts the cable.
And now finally, for the first time,
it is all automated.
His office looks like this.
There's a NASDAQ terminal and next to it, a computer.
The whole thing is silent and it is trading up a storm.
It's making lots and lots of trades.
So many trades that people start to notice.
A high-up official with the NASDAQ Exchange
comes by Petter Fee's office to see.
Petter Fee says the guy is expecting
a room full of traders and terminals.
Instead, there is just this one terminal
attached to a computer.
And he looks and looks and looks and he says,
well, so tell me again, why are you doing this?
So I explained to him what's happening here.
And then he says, I don't think you can do this,
I don't think you can do this,
but I really don't think,
but let me go back to my office and let you know.
And he calls back and he says,
well, look in your NASDAQ rule book,
it says that orders have to be input via the keyboard.
And you're not doing that,
you're just splicing in the wire.
So this is not good, you're violating the rules,
we're giving you a week to correct this rule violation.
One week.
One week.
So this was a problem.
Petter Fee thinks and thinks,
he talks it over with his engineers
and they come up with a solution.
The rules just say the buy and sell orders
have to be entered through the keyboard.
So Petter Fee's team builds a machine that does that.
So it was basically they were rubber fingers
that were typing.
Built a robot to type in the trades.
We built a robot that types.
Petter Fee is very pleased.
For him, this kind of highlights
the absurdity of the situation.
And a week later, the official at NASDAQ comes back.
I triumphantly show him our creation.
And I tell you, he opened his mouth
and never closed it again.
What did that thing sound like when it was running?
It was, that was the only problem was it was very loud.
So you could tell how much activity
there was in the market
because it was typing like crazy.
Like a machine gun.
People started to wear earmuffs,
not earmuffs, what do you call it, earplugs.
And in the next years, in the 1990s,
computerized trading gets a lot easier.
You didn't have to build a typing robot anymore.
The exchanges started to allow Petter Fee
and others trying to do this
just to plug their computers right into the market.
And this brings us to where we are today.
Now, according to an estimate by the tab group,
half of all stock trades are done
because an algorithm told the computer to buy or sell.
Petter Fee today is one of the big players.
The company he started called Interactive Brokers,
it does electronic trades on a mind boggling scale.
The company has two parts.
One is a broker basically
that lets people do trades quickly electronically.
The other part does what's called market making.
When somebody wants to sell a stock,
say their computers will buy it,
then turn around and sell it when someone else wants it.
You don't make a lot of money on every trade,
but you do lots and lots of them.
Petter Fee says automation has done
some very good things for the world.
In the olden days,
back when you needed people to do all your trades,
those people charged you a lot of money to do that.
For example, at Interactive Brokers,
the average commission we charge on a trade
is $4.05 or something like that.
So it's very, very cheap compared to 20 years ago,
if you wanted to do a trade,
it will cost you $50 or $60.
So the savings are humongous.
It's really huge.
Commissions, what he's talking about there,
are definitely lower.
And this is better for everybody.
There's real social value to this.
Like anyone who's ever bought and sold a stock,
anyone with a retirement account,
they get a better deal in a lot of ways.
The financial markets now,
they are like very well-oiled machines.
Okay, yes, there are some benefits from this,
but if the markets are now well-oiled machines,
they seem like well-oiled machines
that keep rushing off the road at high speed
and crashing into trees.
There was the flash crash we described at the beginning,
and that did happen because we had machines
that were trading with other machines.
Pederfee says he remembers that day very clearly.
So where were you when the flash crash happened?
I was right here.
I was sitting by my machinery here
and I just couldn't believe what was going on.
I picked up the phone and I said, what's happening?
People said, we don't know.
It was not a good thing.
The next thing Pederfee said is a little surprising.
I kind of expect guys like Pederfee to just say,
look, faster is better, more automation is better.
But he says we've reached a point of absurdity
where everyone is trying to be faster
and faster and faster to beat the next guy
by a thousandth of a second.
We are competing on milliseconds.
And whether you can shave off three milliseconds
in the execution of an order
has absolutely no social value.
In fact, it may be making the whole system less stable.
It's certainly making everything more expensive
for everyone.
Companies that trade, his included,
have to keep spending more and more money
just to be a tiny bit faster.
Now you have to put your computers physically
right next to the stock exchange.
You have to think about sending signals with lasers
instead of regular wires.
Companies are also talking about laying new optical fibers
underneath the Arctic Ocean in a particular direction,
just so people who pay for it
can get trades to European or Japanese markets
a teeny bit faster.
It's basically not unlike the arms race
used to be against the Russians 20 years ago
or 30 years ago, right?
It's the same question, right?
Who builds the bigger bomb?
Who builds more of them?
How do you put a stop to that, though?
Well, that's the question, that's the, you know.
It's an interesting situation.
It's a situation where I do not quite see
how this will resolve itself.
It's to the benefit of how I don't see
how it will resolve itself to the benefit
of the marketplace.
Let's say a quandary.
Pederfi is in favor of some more regulation,
regulation that will build in some safeguards
and, in the process, slow things down.
The challenge will be, of course,
that people will always try to find a way around the rules.
There's always someone willing to build a robot that types.
As always, let us know what you think.
