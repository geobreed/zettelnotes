On today's show, we visit an office building that straddles the border between Germany and the Netherlands. On one side of the building, there's a German mailbox and a German policeman. On the other side, a Dutch mailbox and a Dutch policeman. The building was supposed to make it easy to work in both countries. But it's also a reminder of how the European dream isn't yet a reality.

Zoe Chace and Robert Smith are reporting from European borders this week. This is the first story in a four-part series.

A metal strip on the floor of Eurode Business Center marks the border between Germany and the Netherlands.

On one side of the building, there's a German mailbox and a German policeman. On the other side, a Dutch mailbox and a Dutch policeman.

The building was supposed to make it easy to work in both countries. But it's also a reminder of how the European dream isn't yet a reality.

The border is open enough that a single building can span it. No border guards, no checkpoints. But a letter sent from the German side of the building takes a week to get to the Dutch side.

A computer security company called Alunsa has offices on both sides of the building. On one side, Alunsa employees call German customers on German phones. On the other side, it's all Dutch. Raimond Potgens, the company's CEO, has two offices, one on either side of the border. He carries his laptop back and forth all day long.

The reason for all the back and forth: Taxes. "As long as Holland and Germany want all their money, it's not one union," Potgens says.

Jan Schlievert, an EU lawyer who also works in the Eurode, agrees with Potgens. "Money is always the turning point for all these laws," he says.

Schlievert tells the story of a Belgian carpenter who spent his days doing carpentry in Germany, then drove home to spend the night in Belgium. The German company he worked for paid for the car.

Belgium wanted to tax the car because it spent the night in a Belgian driveway. Germany wanted to tax the car because it spent the day on German roads. The fight was such a big deal to both countries that they went to court to figure out who got to tax the car. (Germany won.)

This is how a united Europe is being created. Slowly, case by case, one Belgian carpenter at a time.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's cross the English Channel now, and enter the eurozone. Many European nations adopted a single currency years ago. And during the debt crisis, they've been struggling desperately - at great cost - to keep the euro from unraveling.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

The euro was supposed to help unify the continent. It's part of a much larger, generations-long project of lowering barriers at European borders.

INSKEEP: But after all this time, the border lines have proven surprisingly durable. Consider the border where we find NPR's Planet Money team.

ZOE CHACE, BYLINE: I'm Zoe Chace. I'm in an office building in the Netherlands.

ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: And I'm Robert Smith, and I'm in an office building in Germany - and it's actually the same building. There's a borderline that runs right down the middle of the - what do we call this?

HANS HOEVER: We call it Eurode Business Center.

CHACE: Hi. See? We're right next to each other.

SMITH: We're right here.

CHACE: The only sign that we're right on the border, is this metal line embedded in the floor of the building. It's the historical divide between Holland and Germany. Our guide, Hans Hoever, points it out.

SMITH: Where's the border guard?

HOEVER: Border guard? We haven't any - (LAUGHTER) longer.

CHACE: The Eurode Business Center looks like your typical modern office building you might see off the freeway. Just a few floors; dozens of different companies.

SMITH: Everything in this building is twinsies. Here on the German side, there's a German mailbox, German policemen, rows of German companies.

CHACE: Over here: a Dutch mailbox, Dutch policemen, Dutch companies - a few feet away from each other.

SMITH: This building is set up to make it easy to work in multiple countries. But the center's very existence shows how far Europe has to go. Business can be very different, depending on which hallway you go down. For instance, I'm in the German wing...

(SOUNDBITE OF KNOCKING)

SMITH: ...where I find Raimond Potgens, CEO of Alunsa. They sell risk-management software to big companies, like Adidas. And at first, it seems like a normal German company, taking German phone calls on German phones.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

RAIMOND POTGENS: (Speaking German)

SMITH: But then, Potgens starts talking about his other office - his Dutch office on the other side of the building, just down the hall, where Dutch customers call on his Dutch phone.

POTGENS: (Speaking Dutch)

CHACE: It's not that weird for companies to have German branches and Dutch branches, but they aren't usually 40 yards apart. And it's not usually the same workers carrying their laptops back and forth across the border, every single day.

SMITH: I thought the whole point of having the European Union was so that you didn't have to do crazy stuff like this.

POTGENS: Yeah. But as long as Holland and Germany want all their money, it's not one union.

SMITH: Ah. And there's the problem. The European Union didn't create a central government, and so each country fights for their cut of the taxes. Each country has their own, complicated tax code and when Potgens does the math, he thinks it will be cheaper for him to keep two different offices, just across the border from each other.

CHACE: This nationalist urge to grab all the revenue they can - it's not just taxes. Remember those twin mailboxes standing right next to each other, in two different countries?

SMITH: They aren't just symbolic. If you try to send a letter from one end of this building to the other end, and put it in the wrong box...

POTGENS: The letter will go from here to (unintelligible) with airplane to Frankfurt.

CHACE: It wasn't supposed to be like this. The whole idea of European integration, is the smoothing of the borders.

SMITH: And right in the center of this building, we meet the guy who's trying to eliminate the bumps from one country to another.

JAN SCHLIEVERT: Money is always the turning point for all these laws.

CHACE: Jan Schlievert is a German EU lawyer. When people get stuck between bickering European countries with different laws, they come to him.

SMITH: For instance, Jan tells us the story of the Belgian carpenter. The carpenter spends the day doing carpentry on my side of the border, here in Germany.

CHACE: And then at night, drives the company car home to this side - Belgium.

SCHLIEVERT: And then there's a problem because the Belgium taxation office might say, well, you're here in Belgium as a private citizen, driving that car.

CHACE: So Belgium wants to tax the car because it spends the night in a Belgian driveway.

SMITH: And Germany wants to tax the car because it spends the day on German roads. They had to go all the way to the European court, to figure this one out. Germany won.

CHACE: I know it might seem minor, but a unified Europe is being created like this - case by case. Jan Schlievert says they have a saying.

SCHLIEVERT: (Speaking foreign language) - a Europe from the regions.

CHACE: A Europe from the regions.

SMITH: Of course, when the United States created a country from a bunch of regions, it had a central government to help.

CHACE: And a couple hundred years to do it.

SMITH: Europe has buildings like this one, perched between two nations and taking it one car, one mailbox, one problem at a time.

I'm Robert Smith.

**faster whisper:**
For 15 years now, Joe Valentini has done the same thing every morning.
He gets up from his warm bed in Hoboken, New Jersey, clatters downstairs to the path train.
It's the shuttle that runs from Hoboken to downtown New York City every three minutes.
And the train goes under the Hudson River and halfway through the trip, something remarkable happens.
Joe goes from one state to another, New Jersey to New York.
So you're going all the way into New York.
What's it like when you cross the border?
It's scary.
Actually, I wouldn't know.
It all happens underground on the train.
And when I pop out, all of a sudden there I am in New York City, Big Apple.
You know, nobody on the train notices.
You know why?
Because we take this for granted in the United States.
People cross state lines every morning and every night.
There are people who have their homes in Moline, Illinois and work every day in an
office in Davenport, Iowa.
No problem.
And in fact, there are bigger things we don't think about about state borders.
When we send our taxes to Washington, D.C., we may grumble about it, but when they
use it to pay for roads in another state, we barely complain.
Now, Robert and I, we were just reporting in Europe and the most striking thing to
us when we were there is they do not do this.
What Joe just did.
They don't move between borders without thinking about it.
They don't just send their taxes to a big federal government who distributes it in a
certain way. They think about crossing the border and what that means all the
time. Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Zoe Chase.
And I'm Robert Smith.
Today's show, instead of looking at bond yields, ECB press conferences, we'll
just go to the border and you'll see how hard it is to make the dream of a
unified Europe a reality.
For Europe to work, for Europe to solve the problems it's having right now with
the euro, it needs all its citizens to feel more like Joe Wallantini.
It needs to make its borders more invisible.
Remember, that was the entire idea with the European dream.
Yeah, but also had a fundamental glitch in the European plan because the euro
idea was that they could have both, that they could have national identity,
the sovereignty of each country.
They could be who they've been for centuries.
And in addition to that, people could move across borders like Joe without
even thinking about it, take jobs in different countries, bank at the exact
same banks.
So let's go to the very center of Europe, a place where Holland, Germany,
a touch of Belgium, almost France all meet inside a building.
I'm Zoe Chase.
I'm in an office building in the Netherlands and I'm Robert Smith and
I'm in an office building in Germany and it's actually the same building.
There's a border line that runs right down the middle of the, what do we call
this?
We call it the business center.
Hi, see, we're right next to each other.
We're right here.
The only sign that we're right on the border is this metal line embedded in
the floor of this building.
It's the historical divide between Holland and Germany.
And I just have to stop for a second and say, remember, it did not used
to be so easy to cross this line.
Like this was an armed border, tanks would roll in here and these two
countries used to destroy each other.
Now they're friendly enough that our guide, Hans Hofer, he can just walk
right back and forth across this border line without being stopped.
Where's the border guard?
Border guard?
We haven't any longer.
The Euro business center looks like your typical modern office building
you might see off the freeway.
It's pretty symmetrical.
Half of it is in Germany.
Half of it is in the Netherlands.
It's just a few floors and there's dozens of different companies inside.
And everything in this building is twinsies.
It's kind of cute.
Here on the German side where I am, there is a German mailbox.
There is a German policeman who sits at a German desk.
There are rows of German companies that stretch out behind me down the
hallway.
Over here, there's a Dutch mailbox with a Dutch policeman, Dutch companies,
and they're all just a few feet away from each other.
This building is set up to make it easy to work in multiple countries.
In fact, everyone kept saying to us, this building is this symbol of the
new Europe where we cooperate on everything.
We share a receptionist.
We have this single lobby that's in both countries.
But for us seeing this place, it was a reminder of how far Europe has to
go, because when you actually go down the different hallways in different
countries and you talk to the businesses, you find out that the way
they do business is extremely different depending on which country they're in.
For instance, I'm in the German wing right now.
And I'm just knocking on doors and I find this guy, Ramor Pudkens.
He's the CEO of a company called Alunza.
They sell risk management software to big companies like Adidas.
Adidas in Europe.
But at first, this just seems like a normal German company.
You know, Ramor is taking German phone calls on his German phone.
Good morning, Alunza Mitro Marp Pudkens.
And we're talking to Ramor about how business works and why he's in the
center and all this sort of stuff.
And he mentions his other office, his Dutch office.
And we're like, where's your Dutch office?
And he goes, oh, it's just on the other side of the building.
It's down the hall.
And it's the same business, except in this other office, they have Dutch
customers calling on Dutch phones.
And he walked down the hall to answer a phone like this.
Good afternoon, Alunza Mitro Marp Pudkens.
Just to be clear, right, it's not that weird for companies to have a
German branch and a Dutch branch.
Here's what's weird.
They're not usually 40 yards apart from each other.
It's not usually the same workers picking up their laptop in one
country, walking down the hall and setting their laptop down in the
next country multiple times a day.
I thought the whole point of having the European Union was so that you
didn't have to do crazy stuff like this.
Yeah, but as long as Holland and Germany want all the money, it's not one union.
Holland and Germany want all of their money.
That's the problem.
You've got a company that's in the Netherlands and in Germany, and a
company pays taxes, of course, right?
But who should this company pay taxes to?
Which government?
So normally this is sorted out by a central government, but the euro, of
course, didn't create a central government.
So each country thinks, well, I'm going to get as much of the taxes
as I possibly can.
So Germany wants Rommel's taxes and so does Holland.
And each country has their own complicated tax codes and deductions
and exemptions.
And when Rommel does the math, he thinks it will be cheaper for him to
keep two different offices just across the border from each other.
Now this nationalist urge to grab all the revenue they can.
It's not just about taxes.
Like remember those twin mailboxes standing right next to each other in
two different companies?
I thought they were symbolic.
I thought this was a cute thing.
We used to be separate.
Ha ha ha.
No.
If you try to send a letter from one end of this building to the other end
of the building, from let's say the German office of Alonzo to the Dutch
office of Alonzo, and if you put the letter in the wrong box.
The letter would go from here to Zertogenbosch with aeroplane to
Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Herzogenrad.
You lie.
That's not true.
That's true.
It takes five or seven days.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
The whole idea of European integration is the smoothing of the borders.
Even our guide, the sweet Hans Hoover, he's German and he has his own Dutch
twin, the Dutch version of Hans that works in the same office as him in
this building, but where is he?
Yeah, we asked, we were like, Oh, everything's twinsies.
Where's your Dutch counterpart?
On vacation.
Because the Dutch, they get 20 more days of vacation a year than the Germans do.
Now remember, they're working the same job in the same building.
In fact, the borderline goes right through their office, right through
their desks, but Hans, he has to work 20 more days a year than his Dutch
counterpart.
This is what being in Europe is all about.
These tiny conflicts come up every day.
Remember the German policeman, the Dutch policeman, one of them gets a
better pension than the other one.
So actually right here in this building on this border region, they're trying
to resolve all of these little conflicts and through resolving these little
conflicts, they're building this path towards the future where the euro is
healthy and actually works.
So right in the very middle of this building, we met with the people that
are trying to resolve all of these conflicts.
We met this guy Jan Schlievert and when we came up there, they had this
classic European spread like prosciutto de parma and then this cake from
Belgium, you know, little Europe thing.
And Schlievert is this EU lawyer and basically his job is when Germany and
Holland are fighting over taxes, like the taxes of the Alonzo guy, it's
Jan's job to figure out what to do.
And then by answering that question, answer the question for all the
thousands of identical conflicts that are playing out all across Europe.
Money is always the turning point for all these laws.
Money is the turning point for all these laws.
Basically, the path towards European integration is being smoothed by the
question, which country is going to get paid for this?
Which country is going to have to pay out benefits for that?
And resolving those questions, that is Jan's job.
Yeah, it's way more complicated than you might think.
For instance, Jan tells us the story of the Belgian carpenter.
I feel like this is one of those fables, right?
The fable of the Belgian carpenter.
So this carpenter lives in Belgium, but he spends his day doing
carpentry, fixing up walls and houses on my side of the border in Germany.
And then at night drives the company car home to Belgium, actually
just across the border.
And then there's a problem because the Belgium taxation office might
think, well, you're here in Belgium as a private citizen driving that car.
So Belgium wants to tax the car because it spends the night in a Belgian
driveway under Belgian stars.
But hold on.
Germany wants to tax the car because it spends the day on German roads,
doing German work in a German way.
And I know it sounds crazy, but this case went all the way to the
top European court to figure out who gets the money when a car crosses
the border.
I'll save you all the drama.
Germany won.
There was also this totally European, but really fascinating story.
They told us about the French single mother.
She was working in France and living in Germany.
In France, when you have a kid as a single parent, you get help from
the state until the kid turns 18.
In Germany though, a single mom gets state assistance until the
kid is 25 years old.
It's not even a kid anymore.
He's, he's a full adult, but that's the way Germany works.
You get assistance till your child is 25 years old.
But because she's working in France, she gets her benefit under French
law, kid turns 19, her benefits stop.
And she's all, well, Jan describes it.
I'm a single mother in Germany where I live.
I would get it until 25.
So that can't be right.
And she went to the court and the European court decided that in
that special case, she has actually a right to get the German
money.
Although she is covered by French law, but we make an exception from
the rule and you're getting it.
Everyone in your situation gets a benefit.
I know it's confusing.
Believe me, the court thought it was confusing too, but it boiled
down to this Germany is paying a French woman German money because
the French law wasn't good enough, didn't provide enough benefits.
And Jan says, this is a case of, he describes it as discrimination.
It's not discrimination the way we talked about in the United States,
racial discrimination, gender discrimination.
It's discrimination between countries.
He feels his job is to get the best possible deal for any citizen of
any country in Europe.
And if that means getting more money than they would have gotten
otherwise, well, that's what he thinks is good.
It might seem minor, just, you know, this, this case of the
single mom and the case of the Belgian carpenter.
But again, a unified Europe is being created like this case by
case. Hans Hofer says they have a saying.
A Europe from the regions, a Europe from the bottom to the
top. That's how Hans describes it.
It's funny, you know, you could almost imagine Alexander
Hamilton saying the same thing in the United States 200 years ago.
We need an America from the regions.
The difference was that Hamilton and the rest of the founding
fathers, they were top down guys.
They believed in a central government, that only a central
government could smooth over the borders between a lot of
bickering states, just like Europe has now.
Now, Europe took the harder road.
They decided they would not have a central authority.
They were going to do everything from the bottom up.
And they have to figure out every single thing.
They have to figure out the tax code.
They have to figure out the benefits.
And let's give Europe a little credit.
They're actually doing it very fast compared to the 100 years or
so that it took us, although it may feel like it's taking a
hundred years watching it play out.
Remember that guy in the very beginning of the show when we
took the train from New Jersey to New York.
It took a long time to make it that easy.
That's where Europe is now.
Be patient.
So this office building, the Eurota Business Center, was
actually the first stop that Zoe and I took on a one week
fast whirlwind trip through Europe.
We traveled along many of the borders of Europe, talking
about not the huge global issues that countries are facing,
but the tiny local border issues that countries are facing.
And we'll have a couple more podcasts coming up about that.
So please send us any thoughts you have about today's show,
comments, questions, planetmoney at NPR.org, Facebook,
Twitter, et cetera.
I'm Zoe Chase.
And I'm Robert Smith.
Thanks for listening.
