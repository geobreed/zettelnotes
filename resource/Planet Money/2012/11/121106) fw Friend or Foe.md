Why do businesses selling the same thing crowd around each other rather than strike out on their own? To answer that question, Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt walk through some New York City neighborhoods – the diamond district, the plant district, the chess district — where store after store sells the exact same thing.

**faster whisper:**
Hello everybody this is Chana here. I'm coming to you from the studio in New York from our offices.
We're all very excited to be back and it is November 6 election day. We've still got several
staff people out covering the storm and covering the election today so we decided we're going to
bring you an old favorite show that is about New York but has nothing to do with Sandy. Hope
you like it. Hey. It's very quiet in here. Do we need to be quiet? I think this is the quietest
room of 30 people I've ever been in. Why are they all so quiet? Because they're concentrating
on playing. Adam, I think we should, can you introduce the show? Oh yeah okay. Hello and
welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson and we're whispering because we're
in a very quiet chess store in the village. Yes this is the first of a couple stops that
we're going to make in New York City today and all of these stops have one thing in common.
And it'll all make sense in just a second but first yes we're here in the village chess store
and there are shelves of antique handmade Italian sets and there's a beautiful 19th
century Chinese set and then there are a bunch of guys squished in here and these
little tables facing off over much more basic chessboards. Here's the owner Lawrence Nash.
It's like this all the time and we stay open till after midnight. Nathan will be here probably
until two o'clock tonight and then I'll have to convince everyone to leave. So yeah it's
quite a scene. They'll be here till dawn. Oh yeah yeah yeah. One more game, one more game.
And how do you make money? What do you sell? We don't, who said we made money?
We don't make any money here. We we charge for a play and we sell chess sets. Lawrence's store is
of course a very specialty kind of store but it is not one of a kind and and that brings us
Hannah to our indicator. The indicator is the number two. Two that is how many chess stores
are located on this one single very short block in the village. And that brings us to the
question we're wrestling with on today's show. Why does this happen? Why is it so often that
you see stores that sell the same thing all clumped together? Right in in Seattle down the
street from my office there were eight shoe stores on the same block. They weren't even like
not not two or three blocks apart all lined up. In Philly where I grew up there was
Jewelers Row. And I've seen this phenomenon all over the world. You just see all these shops
selling exactly the same thing. I think in the Middle East the bazaars are really striking.
You see like 30 guys selling spices all the same spices all lined up then 50 guys selling
you know textiles all the same textiles all lined up. And you see this all over New York
and all sorts of different types of stores and you would think like let's say you were like
hey I'm gonna open a shop you know village chess shop sure they have some business I'm
gonna open my own specialty chess shop. Wouldn't you want to be as far away from
Lawrence's shop as possible? But of course Hannah that is not how it worked out.
No that is not how it happened. In fact a competitor came and set up a shop
right across the street. Oh Hannah it's so much worse than that. The competitor
was Lawrence's own protege. A man Lawrence trained in the specialty chess shop business
took all that learning went right across the street and opened a competing
chess store. There were some bad feelings but it's just so long ago.
Yeah there was if somebody you teach then leaves and opens up across the street
it's gonna be bad feelings for sure. All right you might not be able to tell it from that tape
but Lawrence is being very diplomatic about this defection this betrayal. John Zachary across
the street at the chess forum the competing chess shop he's more direct when you ask him
about it it was war. There's numerous numerous publications detailing the entire saga like
you know just long epic saga. For years the chess forum stole business from village chess
and Lawrence and his aunt and uncle who started the business they were bitter because the only
reason anyone ever found chess forum was thanks to them. So this war continued and both sides
worried about what the other one was doing but then something strange started to happen. It
started when the chess forum took out an ad in a newspaper and then another ad in an important
chess publication and people started showing up in Lawrence's store in the village chess shop
saying things like you know I saw your you know your your ad or I saw their ad I mean I saw you
and that kind of thing that's a that's a great feeling and I'm sure he had plenty of that
because starting out he had the people immediately coming to his place that he didn't have to
advertise for so you know he had your people coming at him our people so in the immediate
it's much harder but in the long run it evens out and it's all good. The competition
was very good for business. Thompson Street in the village was becoming known as the chess district.
It was so good for business it was almost as good as Bobby Fischer winning the U.S.
No nothing in the chess world is as good as Bobby Fischer. All right maybe not that good but
the chess forum was helping village chess. Village chess was helping the chess forum. It was not
stabbing in the back. It was not betrayal. It's what someone once told me is called
co-opetition. So they were giving the area a name by having two stores there and drawing people
in. Now would Lawrence at village chess be heartbroken if the chess forum closed up shop
tomorrow? No it would not bother me at all. But for the most part it's strangely been a
really good thing. Okay Adam next stop. All right maybe these chess guys are just some
weird anomaly. Let's go up about 25 blocks north to 28th street. There's a forest there
between sixth and seventh avenue. A forest with a McDonald's in the middle of it. Right aside
from the McDonald's pretty much everything on this block is plant related. Well we are in a
flower and plant district. The sidewalks are full of trees and plants. It is so pretty and
each store is trying to grab your attention and get you into their plant store and not
one of the competing plant stores. And this guy his name is Chad Markovich. He's at Noble
Planta. And unlike Lawrence at village chess, Chad set up here because there was competition.
When I started this business it was already like known as a flower and plant district.
And then idea was to be where the demand is which is here. Chad did the calculation Lawrence
had to learn the hard way. He thought you know I could set up my plant store in some
strip mall in Queens and I could be the only plant store for 10 square miles and own the
place and I could probably charge a lot more per plant because people won't have any other options.
Or I could put myself right next to 30 other plant stores and I'll have to bring my prices down
but I will get 30 times as many customers. Tourist buses around they go through to see
the flower and plant district. You know it's already the word out well-established market
has been even before me probably 40 50 years is here. You know Hannah I know a district
to beat all districts it's the most famous district in New York the diamond district 47th
street. All right last stop is also the craziest the diamond district. We buy we buy
we buy second floor 41 west we buy we buy we buy what do you buy we buy gold diamond watches
coins drop. There are 2600 jewelry and jewelry related shops on this one little block they're
mostly in these little booths in these little diamond malls hundreds and hundreds of people
even before you go in there's all these people on the street corner trying to get you to go
to their booth and not one of their competitors booths. Good deal good deal good deal no money
no honey no money no honey we buy we buy we buy. So Adam we walk in and the first guy we see
is Peter Kahn and I am actually immediately so overwhelmed by how many possible people
that we could interview in this one place I just go right to him he's the first guy we see.
And we ask him the same question we ask everyone else why are you here? I see this diamond
earring is 3400 dollars right. Where do you live? New Jersey. New Jersey so strip mall in
New Jersey they exist believe it or not. What could you sell that for four grand five grand?
The 3400 you see there doesn't sell for 3400 sells for two thousand dollars if it was the
same quality made exactly the same in a retail store without all the 50% off sales it would
sell for almost double. So you could make twice as much money selling that in New Jersey?
As much. You'd sell half as much? Right yeah there's more volume here
okay because people know they can come in here and they can walk in the entire street
and they're bound to find what they want. So these stores that clump together they all
make the same calculation as the plant people did and the chess shops did. Yes you've got a
lot of competition and that does drive prices down maybe even half as much as they would be
if you were all on your own but being all clumped together you'll get way more eyeballs
way more traffic and that makes up for it. Extra traffic outweighs extra competition.
So the clumping is basically because of that general rule but then on top of that
each industry has its own special reasons for wanting to clump like in the plant district
tourists happen by the plant district but also plant wholesalers only go there they don't mess
around with one neighborhood shop in Queens so if you want to reach the wholesale market
and get the tourists at the same time you need to be in the plant district.
So diamond sellers follow the same rule they want the extra traffic that being part of a
large diamond district brings and they also want access to the wholesale diamond market which
is of course centered in the diamond district but Peter Kant told us there's something else
and not just him pretty much I think every single diamond seller we talked to said the
same exact thing I don't I want to be here because it's safer if I had my own shop
out in a strip mall in New Jersey I'm gonna get held up and everyone I know who's out there
does get held up being alone is too scary. And strangely when you're surrounded by stores
that are all you know pretty much exactly the same as you you actually have to try
especially hard to be more different. Right next door a couple booths down
from Peter was this Ecuadorian woman who says her specialty is serving the Ecuadorian community
Peter told us that his specialty is long-term trusting relationships with a small but elite
clientele. And then there's this other guy the seller Arto Kant and he's working with this
customer it's a little bit harder to figure out what his specialty is because it is
certainly not customer service or humility.
But I like his work. So Arto's specialty is being number one. Can you believe Hanna
that we just happened upon the number one jewelry guy? He is certainly not the only
guy there who told us that he's number one. So you know I was thinking that there's
something cool about seeing this kind of small retail level of clumping but realizing that
the same basic decisions that Arto or Peter Kahn or the flower and plant store guy or the
chess store guys are making that same economic decision also applies to the largest corporations
in America. I mean look at Silicon Valley where you have basically all the big high tech or most
of the big high tech companies all in the same area. New York Wall Street is similar and it's
actually the same idea. Their customers are there. They want to be within walking distance
or driving distance of their customers. All the talent is there. It makes sense even in
this high tech internet age to be physically near people who are your competitors. You can
actually do better when you're close to your competitor. You know on the other hand though
there are stores that if they're clustered together it would be a really bad move for
them like laundry stores or grocery store stuff in your neighborhood like the gym
where proximity wins. It's more important to be close to people in their homes than to be in
a district. All right Hanna I think that's going to do it for us here today on Planet
Money on our blog npr.org slash money we have some really great pictures of the stores we
visited. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Hanna Jaffee-Walt. Thanks for listening.
