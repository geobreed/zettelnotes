One day in the early 1990s, a man walked into the U.S. embassy in Ecuador. He said he had information somebody would want to hear — information on how to go after some of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world. The man worked as a money changer. He said he was getting a lot of requests from traffickers who had a problem: They had so much cash that they didn't know what to do with it. They couldn't figure out how to launder their money. What they needed was an offshore bank to help them. On today's show, we hear how two U.S. agents — one IRS, one DEA — created a fake offshore bank to catch drug traffickers.

**faster whisper:**
Sometime in the early 90s, a man walked into the U.S.
embassy in Ecuador.
He said he had information someone would want to hear
information on how to go after some of the most powerful
drug traffickers in the world.
This guy said he was willing to help.
And what happened next was that two special agents
in Atlanta got a phone call.
Skip Latson with the DEA the Drug Enforcement
Administration and Bill Bruton with the IRS heard
about this guy and thought we've got to meet him.
The initial meeting was in Ecuador.
Quito.
Quito, Ecuador.
Did you go on that trip?
No.
You didn't take me.
Did you have a code name for this guy or anything?
Yeah.
Yeah, he was it was a code name.
What was his code name?
Dan.
That is the least creative code name I've ever heard.
It is.
Dan, the informant, worked as a currency
exchanger.
He was the guy you went to if you had pesos and you
wanted dollars or vice versa.
And Dan told Skip and Bill he was getting a lot of
requests from drug traffickers, drug traffickers
with a problem, a problem Bill and Skip had never
fully appreciated.
They were having a very difficult time with just
the logistics of laundering millions and
millions and millions of dollars every week.
Every week?
Well, yes.
Imagine the situation.
The drug traffickers are smuggling all this
cocaine into the United States.
The cocaine gets sold on the street.
But there's this problem.
People buying cocaine aren't paying with credit
cards. They're paying in small bills, tens,
fives and ones.
So the drug traffickers have hundreds of
thousands or millions of dollars in physical
cash. And it just weighs a lot.
Bill, the IRS agent, remembers raiding a drug
traffickers house and finding a huge amount of
cash.
I think it was in like seven or eight suit
cases. And it took 10 of us
to to carry.
It was so heavy.
That's so funny. I never thought about that,
just that the actual money would be.
That's a unique problem.
It's unique to the illegal industry.
The weight of the money is huge.
It's absolutely astronomical.
This was a huge problem for drug traffickers,
a problem the traffickers needed solved.
They needed someone to take all that heavy
cash and turn it into a check or a wire
transfer, something that doesn't weigh 800
pounds.
Basically, the Colombian drug traffickers,
they needed a bank.
Here's Bill again.
A couple of weeks later, Skip and I were
sitting down now in Atlanta and we're
saying, well, let's open up a bank.
Had you ever opened up a bank before?
No, this is the first one.
I mean, you never you didn't have any
history. You didn't have you never worked
for a bank or anything.
No, I never worked for a bank in my my
entire career was with, you know, the
criminal evasion of IRS.
Sort of like if only somebody could do
this crazy thing and then you guys are
sitting here later thinking like.
Like maybe we can.
Maybe we can.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Khanna Jaffee.
Well, today's show Operation DeNiro.
Two secret government agents go
offshore, create a fake bank and
launder money for some of the largest
and most dangerous drug kingpins
around.
We came across Bill and Skip and
Operation DeNiro because we here at
Planet Money recently got into the
offshore financial world.
Ourselves, we created an offshore
company in Belize to get an inside
look at the secret world.
And when we were researching this, we
discovered that back in the 1990s, the
U.S. government had done exactly the
same thing, except the government went
way, way further than we did.
We chose Belize, Bill and Skip, the
two government agents wanting to open
this fake bank.
They chose Anguilla, an island in the
Caribbean.
And that is where they imagined their
future customers were already banking.
Those areas, those offshore accounts are
where people launder money.
So it just made sense to offer an
offshore bank.
Operation DeNiro wasn't the first
project Bill and Skip had worked on
together.
They had been working together for
decades.
These two guys are in each other's
brains.
They know exactly what the other
likes for lunch every day.
And the day that we met them, they
were wearing matching outfits, both in
polos and pleated khakis.
And for years, Bill and Skip have
been chasing the same guys, guys
like Pablo Escobar, notorious drug
kingpin in Colombia.
A man so dangerous, there are many
movies all about just how bad this
guy was.
Assassination, a billion dollar
drug empire, one of the most
wanted outlaws of the 20th
century.
Pablo Escobar, in my opinion, is
the largest, biggest criminal the
world has ever seen or will ever
see.
Skip, the special agent with the
DEA, thought about Pablo Escobar
a lot.
He remembers seeing this article in
Forbes magazine.
Forbes does this list of the
richest people in the world, and
Pablo Escobar was on it.
This criminal was a billionaire,
exactly the kind of guy who
needs banking services.
Bill and Skip thought, we
should be the ones providing
those banking services.
We'll see where all the money
goes.
We'll see how the whole
operation works.
And so, Operation De Niro was a
go, and Bill and Skip needed a
name for their fake bank to
service drug traffickers.
And they thought about it, and
they thought, well, it should
definitely have the word trust
in the name.
And also, we should use
initials.
A lot of bank names seem to
have initials.
So they chose RHM, which
apparently stands for
absolutely nothing, and RHM
Trust Bank was born.
And it was the first time that
any government agency worldwide
had established a bank, the
sole purpose of which was to
track drug traffickers' money.
I would imagine that doesn't
happen all the time.
And I don't know if it's ever
happened since.
I dug out some old photos.
We had a party at our office
when RHM Trust Bank was
finally approved.
You guys, is that champagne
that you have there?
No, it's in a federal
facility.
That's apple juice.
Sparkling.
Bill and Skip did everything
you have to do for a bank
before it opens.
They printed up brochures.
They made some official-looking
IDs and fake business cards.
But their bank was very
different from every other
bank in that their plan was
to turn away almost all
potential customers.
They didn't set up branch
offices.
There are no ATMs, no
smiling bank tellers, just
one office in Atlanta with a
telephone and a fax number.
We didn't want to deal with
anybody else's money,
except the drug traffickers.
You don't want ordinary
people coming in and saying,
I'd like to open a
checking account.
And you're like, we're not
a real bank.
Exactly.
Bill and Skip were in
business.
And the way it would work is
that the drug traffickers
would have this cash that
needed to be deposited.
So they'd fax RHM Trust an
account number and they'd
send them a beeper number.
Yes, faxes beepers.
Remember, this was the 90s.
So then whoever's going to
pick the money up calls the
beeper.
The guy calls him back and
says, meet me at XYZ
street corner at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning.
And what kind of car are
you going to be in?
I'm going to be in a blue
Chevy.
Supposed to give them a
code word that could be
very something, very simple.
This is I have a package
for Amanda.
Then they would call meet
and the package would be
exchanged, usually suitcases
or packages from trunk to
trunk in a public place.
It's amazing how this is
just like every cop show
I've ever seen, except
that usually the government
isn't helping the bad guys
launder drug money.
What would happen next is
Bill and Skip's guys would
take the cash to a local
bank, deposit it into an
account owned by RHM Trust
Bank, and then wire the
money to wherever the drug
traffickers wanted it sent
to.
And it all worked.
The drug people were very
happy with RHM Trust Bank.
Bill and Skip were getting
closer.
They were learning all this
stuff about the money
laundering world.
There they are wandering
around this dark place and
they start bumping into all
these other people who
exist in the dark.
Like, for instance, turns
out they were not the only
ones offering financial
services to drug dealers.
It was a busy place with
established rates for doing
this kind of thing.
We were competing against
other money pickups.
So Skip says I'm going to
charge you nine percent.
Well, then you come to me.
Well, I'm going to charge you
eight and a half.
And you go back to Skip and
says I got somebody eight
and a half.
He's like, I'll charge
you eight.
You're in a competitive
marketplace.
Very competitive market.
And we had to make sure
we were not so cheap to
be suspicious, but not so
high that we wouldn't get
customers.
Word spread and soon more
and more orders were
coming in, which for Bill
and Skip meant more
information.
One of the tricks that I
always laughed at when
Skip wanted to find out who
the true owner of the
money was.
He would delay by 24 hours
and sending the money.
And then we'd get
telephone calls and find
out, oh, that that
person comes out of the
woodwork when it looks
like that the money may
be in jeopardy.
We picked up more
information by being a
bad bank who didn't
handle money quickly
and effectively.
That's high net worth
individuals.
High net worth
individuals, yes, in
risky adventures.
Bill and Skip were winning.
They had tricked the
drug dealers.
They'd gained their
trust.
They had them right
where they wanted them.
But at the same time,
Bill and Skip were
becoming more and more
aware that they weren't
fully understanding the
money laundering scheme
that they were taking
part in.
Like there were
constantly things that
didn't really make
sense.
They'd pick up money off
the street and then
they'd be told to wire
it, not to Columbia,
where the drug traffickers
were, but to some
legitimate American
business that was
selling, like, tractor
parts or something.
It was all very
confusing.
There were a lot of
smart people involved
on that end of it.
Ex-bankers, money
brokers that had been
doing this for
generations.
And it was, to me,
a complicated system.
What Bill and Skip
were uncovering is
now called the
black market peso
exchange system.
It was a series of
cleverly disguised
money transfers to
convert the drug
money that was stuck
in the United States
into pesos back in
Columbia.
It worked by hiding the
money in the normal
flow of trade and
payments for things
like tractor parts.
So Bill and Skip
were nearly there.
They were inside this
complicated marketplace
and close to figuring
it all out.
Until, at one moment,
they came extremely
close to being
discovered, not by
the drug traffickers,
but by their own
people, by U.S.
bank regulators.
So I have to say,
David, we don't spend
a lot of time on
this show talking about
how bank regulators
are doing a great job.
But in this situation,
they did exactly what
you want bank
regulators to do.
Regulators at the
Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency,
this is a U.S.
regulatory agency
that regulates banks,
they showed up
with some questions
about this
RHM Trust Bank.
The head of security
called me up
and said,
come on over here.
The OCC is here
and they're auditing
your account.
You better get over
here right now.
And so I walked over
there, talked to
the auditor, talked to
What did you tell them?
I told him that he had
uncovered a
covert government operation.
Congratulations.
And please don't
tell anybody.
And he said
he's stopping the audit
right then and there.
And by the time
I got back to my car,
I got a call
from the OCC supervisor
saying they were
in the process of
shredding their notes
and everything else
they copied,
but they had already
notified the OCC
in Washington.
In Washington,
the next morning
was going to send
the facts out to
every OCC bank
in the world.
Or in the United States,
notifying them
that RHM Trust Bank
was not a bank
to do transactions with.
But what happened then?
So they were going
to set out this fax.
They stopped the fax.
We got there in time.
They stopped the fax.
And man,
your cover was
almost blown there.
Almost within
within 24 hours,
we would have been
in trouble.
We would have been stopped.
RHM Trust Bank
existed for a little
less than a year.
And the drug guys
never figured it out.
In the end,
the thing that killed
the bank
was success.
We got we got to be
a little too popular.
We were being approached
or informed
it was being approached
for for other offers
to do illegal things.
And that wasn't our target.
They were asking
you to do stuff
and you're like,
we don't know
how to do that.
We were authorized
to do A&B
and they're asking us
to do C&D.
Why can't you do C&D?
And so the correct answer
to that question is we can't
because we're actually
undercover agents
and we only got approval
to do certain kinds
of transactions with you.
So we can't give you a loan
or whatever else you want.
It just got to starting to be
get a little bit out of hand.
So the decision was made
to shut the bank down.
And by this point,
it had uncovered
a drug network
that extended to lots
of different countries.
And the Italian government
in particular was eager
to start making arrests.
So Bill and Skip scrambled
to coordinate a massive
simultaneous bust.
Just like in the movies,
you want to pounce on everyone
all at once.
So one guy can't
warn his friends and say,
hey, the cops just showed up.
Hide.
And so at a specific time,
it began.
One hundred and sixteen people
connected to R.H.M.
Trust Bank in four
different countries
were arrested.
Bill saw a video of what
happened in Italy.
They showed the police precinct
and they were like 20, 30
of these little teeny
international police cars.
And all of them scream out
of the out of the
compound at one time
and they go in all
different directions like ants.
And then they showed
X hours later them
bringing all these
fugitives or arrested
people back in.
But it was.
It was quite,
quite harrowing.
What did it feel like
to watch that?
I was exhausted.
I was exhausted.
It was finally over with.
Officials seized nine
tons of cocaine
and more than 90
million dollars
in cash and property.
But of the over
100 people arrested,
billionaire Pablo Escobar
was not in that group.
He remained out there.
In fact, Skip and Bill
did not bring down
any of the ring leaders.
They say what they did do
was make the drug guys
wonder about who
they could trust.
Usually the secrecy
of the offshore world.
That is a problem
for the government,
for guys like Bill and Skip,
because it hides
all the illegal activity.
But this time it hid them
from the bad guys
and it hurt the drug
traffickers.
I know one thing.
They can't trust a bank now
as a result of what
happened here.
They can't.
They have to be careful
and think twice
if they go to a bank
to to trust them
to handle their
financial transactions.
It could be could be
another government bank.
Do you guys feel like
you're winning
the money laundering battle
or is it just a matter
of setting them back
for a few years
and they find some
other way to do it?
I think we're I think
we were winning
20 years ago
and I think we're winning today
because a win
doesn't necessarily
mean you stop it.
You change their their
methodology for doing it.
And I think that was one
of the greatest successes
of the bank
that we were able to
get them off of a very
sophisticated process
in the bulk shipments.
Bulk shipments,
taking all that heavy money
and physically carrying it,
sneaking it across the border.
To do that,
you don't need an offshore bank.
You just need a truck.
We are still looking
for other things
that we can do
with our offshore companies.
I don't think that we're
going to be setting up
a fake bank
or getting into money
laundering,
but we would like ideas
of other things
that we can do
with these companies.
And in particular,
we're looking to talk
to people who have set up
an offshore company
for legitimate
business purposes.
We want to know
what you use
your offshore company for.
If you know someone,
if you are someone,
send us an email
planetmoneyatnpr.org.
As always, we want to know
what you think.
Our website is npr.org.
We have photos up
from Operation Dinero,
including that office party
with the sparkling
apple juice
and also a diagram
about how much money weighs.
I'm David Kestenbaum
and I'm Khanna Jeffy-Walt.
Thanks for listening.
