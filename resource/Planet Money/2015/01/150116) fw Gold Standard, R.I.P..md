DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hey, PLANET MONEY listeners. It's David. Every so often we like to actually buy something in order to better understand it. In 2010, we bought a toxic asset - you all named it Toxie. Toxie eventually died. Next week we are going to buy something new. And to set the stage, we are re-airing a couple stories we did in 2011 when we bought a gold coin.

In the last episode, we met a charming guy who made an argument for going back to the gold standard. Today we tell you what actually happened when the world was on a gold standard and why most economists think it's best we just put the whole thing behind us. Here it is.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHELL GAMES")

BRIGHT EYES: (Singing) If I could change my mind, change the paradigm...

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum.

GOLDSTEIN: Today on the podcast, the story of a coded message that one of the world's most powerful bankers totally does not understand.

KESTENBAUM: Also, the story of how Franklin Delano Roosevelt ignored the advice of America's big-name economists and listened instead to a guy who helped him take care of his trees.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHELL GAMES")

KESTENBAUM: Almost everyone we talked to about the gold standard told us that it is not just a bad idea, it's actually a dangerous one.

GOLDSTEIN: Take, for example, the economist Randy Parker from East Carolina University. He seemed like a very easy going guy, but when we asked him about the gold standard, he got all serious on us.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

RANDALL PARKER: I think that it is a pernicious anachronism that should be kept in the history books. And to think that modern people today want to speak about its resurrection should absolutely horrify and terrify anyone who understands economics even a little bit.

KESTENBAUM: He actually said it should die the death of a thousand stings.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, he's not kidding around when it comes to the gold standard. And the reason he thinks this and - I don't know, say 99 percent of his colleagues think this and hate the gold standard so much is they say it caused the modern world's worst financial disaster. They say it caused the Great Depression.

KESTENBAUM: And just to set the stage, back then, all the key economic powers in the world - England, France, Germany, the United States, even Japan, they are all on the gold standard. Austria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, Norway, New Zealand and even Australia - they are all on the gold standard.

GOLDSTEIN: I think you were doing circular breathing there, Kestenbaum. That was very impressive. So now remember, this - in a way it's not that surprising because gold and money have basically been synonymous forever. You've got gold coins going back to 2000 B.C. And in England, they've been on some form of the gold standard since the 1700s when Isaac Newton - yes, that Isaac Newton - ran the Mint.

KESTENBAUM: So that's the way things had been up until 1931, which is where we pick up the story. In 1931, there's a man with a pointy beard who is running England's central bank. His name is Montagu Norman. So England is the most powerful economic force on earth at the time. So he is the most important central banker on the planet. And by all accounts, he's a very wise man, a very smart man, and somewhat eccentric. We talked about Montagu Norman with Liaquat Ahamed, who wrote a book about this era called "Lords Of Finance."

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

LIAQUAT AHAMED: In contrast to most bankers of the time who dressed in, you know, top hat and frock coat, and had long whiskers, he was a very unusual looking man. He had this big, black floppy hat, a cape, an Emerald tie pin, a sort of Van Dyke beard. The New York Times described him as looking like the chief conspirator out of an Italian opera.

KESTENBAUM: Reporters loved Montagu Norman and Montagu Norman loved to hide from reporters. Ahamed writes that he once jumped over the side of a ship in high seas to avoid the press - basically got into a dinghy and slipped away before the ship got to port where the reporters had gathered.

GOLDSTEIN: Now unfortunately for Montagu Norman, in 1931, reporters had a lot of questions for him. The world was falling apart, stock markets were way down, unemployment was way up, banks were collapsing.

KESTENBAUM: And the gold standard was becoming a big problem. So just to review, the way the gold standard worked was that every major currency in the world was backed by gold. In the U.S., you could take $20.67 and the government had to give you an ounce of gold. In England, it was four pounds 86 pence for an ounce of gold. That was fixed. And in normal times, people didn't even really think about trading in their money for gold. They were perfectly happy with their paper dollars and their paper pounds.

GOLDSTEIN: But of course 1931 was not normal times. People were saying, you know what? I don't trust my paper pounds. I'm freaked out. I want gold. The stock market crashed in the U.S. Banks are going under. I'm worried the whole financial system might crash. So everybody started trading in their cash and demanding gold. And this was a big problem for Montagu Norman and the Bank of England.

KESTENBAUM: Because at some point, the Bank of England is going to run out of gold. So Montagu Norman has to stop this. And the only way to stop the rush of people converting their pounds for gold is to raise interest rates. Why raise interest rates? Well, if you raise interest rates, that's an incentive for people to hold on to their paper currency. People will say, OK, I won't trade it in for gold. If I keep it in the bank in England, I can earn all this interest.

GOLDSTEIN: And this is why economists today look back and say the gold standard was such a disaster. In times of crisis, you want to be doing the exact opposite of this. You want to be lowering interest rates to make it easier for business to borrow money and hire people to get the economy going. This is what we do now when we hit recessions.

KESTENBAUM: Again, Liaquat Ahamed.

AHAMED: So you have this perverse system whereby in the middle of the Great Depression with 15 percent unemployment, countries were raising interest rates. And that is essentially what converted what was a terrible depression into the Great Depression.

KESTENBAUM: This is Montagu Norman's dilemma - he has to raise interest rates to keep gold in his country, but by raising interest rates, he's causing the Great Depression.

GOLDSTEIN: Of course Montagu Norman does have another option, right? He could just say we're off the gold standard. You can no longer trade in 4 pounds and 86 pence for an ounce of gold. This would solve his problem. He wouldn't have to worry about the Bank of England running out of gold, so he wouldn't have to keep raising interest rates. But for Montagu Norman, the idea of going off the gold standard was insane. England was the world's biggest economic power, and in his mind, Britain's economy rested on the gold standard.

KESTENBAUM: So what does Montagu Norman do faced with this choice between two impossible paths - go off the gold standard or choke the economy by raising interest rates? What does he do? He collapses.

AHAMED: The sort of pressures of the job got to him and he collapsed one day.

KESTENBAUM: Like loses consciousness, or...

AHAMED: Yeah. I mean, he would - he just couldn't get out of bed. And I don't quite know what all of the symptoms are of a nervous breakdown, but he basically couldn't function and would have terrible headaches. And so his doctor told him that you're going to have to leave the country and go on a rest cure.

KESTENBAUM: This is the most important central banker on the planet at the time.

AHAMED: Yeah. During the worst financial crisis.

GOLDSTEIN: It's basically like Ben Bernanke taking a vacation the day after Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt.

AHAMED: Yeah, or the week before actually. So, you know - and Ben Bernanke's doctors telling him, God, you know, you're not functioning. I'm afraid you're going to have to just leave the country and go off somewhere.

KESTENBAUM: I suppose he was worried that if he did the wrong thing, he was going to bring the entirety of civilization to a halt.

AHAMED: Well, that's exactly - you know, he thought that the entire - the future of Western civilization was in his hands.

GOLDSTEIN: So with the future of Western civilization in his hands, Montagu Norman gets on a ship and takes a trip to Canada. He writes in his diary, quote, "feeling queer." And then while he's gone - actually while he's on the ship on his way back home to England, the people he's left in charge - they decide, you know, we said we weren't going to do this but we have to do it. We have to abandon the gold standard because if we don't, we, the Bank of England, we're going to run out of gold.

KESTENBAUM: And they have to notify the boss, Montagu Norman. So they send Montagu Norman this cable in code - remember, he's on the ship coming home. And the cable reads, sorry we have to go off tomorrow and cannot wait to see you before doing so.

GOLDSTEIN: And Montagu Norman, he actually thinks this just means, oh my friend's going to be out of the office when I get back. But, of course, what the cable means is we're off the gold standard. They're not leaving work early. They're taking one of the most radical steps in the history of finance. And not only is England catapulting itself into this crazy new world where money is just paper, they're also setting up what will be a chain reaction around the world.

KESTENBAUM: So to understand this, imagine two people in London the day before England goes off the gold standard. Both have 20 pounds in cash money. One of them goes to the bank that day and trades in his pounds for gold. He gets about five ounces of gold, just like it's always been. The other guy, he holds onto his paper money. All right, next day Montagu Norman's colleagues at the Bank of England drop the bomb - boom - England's off the gold standard. What that means in practice is that when England cuts those strings tying the pound to the gold standard, the pound drops in value.

GOLDSTEIN: So this guy who traded in his pounds for gold, he made a smart move, he did great. His five ounces of gold are now worth more than 20 pounds. He just made money by getting rid of his pounds before England went off the gold standard. The other guy, the guy who kept his pounds, he's the sucker. And obviously nobody wants to be a sucker.

KESTENBAUM: So people all over the world see England go off the gold standard - England, the mightiest economy in the world. And they worry. Will my government do the same thing? Am I going to be the next sucker? So as their economies get worse, they start turning in their paper money for gold - including people here in the United States.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: Because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold.

KESTENBAUM: This is FDR's first fireside chat on March 12, 1933. The U.S. has just had the mother of all bank runs. People are afraid that banks are going to fail, so they're yanking their dollars out. And they're also worried that the U.S. will follow England and abandon the gold standard. So a lot of people are trading in their dollars for gold. People are hoarding cash and gold. And FDR is really upset about that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ROOSEVELT: Let me make it clear to you that the banks will take care of all needs, except, of course, the hysterical demands of hoarders. And it is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime in every part of our nation.

GOLDSTEIN: But FDR is actually about to make a move that will take all those unfashionable gold hoarders and turn them into winners. Everybody who's not hoarding gold - FDR's about to turn them into suckers.

KESTENBAUM: Here's Barry Eichengreen. He's an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the world experts on the Great Depression and the gold standard.

BARRY EICHENGREEN: He's preparing to take the U.S. off the gold standard. He's preparing to say we will no longer pay out gold at a price of $20 an ounce.

KESTENBAUM: You know what's amazing to me? He doesn't say, look, I know a lot of people are really attached to the gold standard. It sounds like it makes sense, but it doesn't make sense, and I'm taking you off it.

GOLDSTEIN: He doesn't say that at all. It's sort of in code.

EICHENGREEN: Yeah he is kind of tiptoeing around the issue. And that's for two reasons. I think number one, to say the gold standard was a disaster, and we are abandoning it for something better, stay tuned for what that is wouldn't have been confidence inspiring. But the other part of the answer is that Roosevelt was kind of still grappling toward a full response to the crisis.

GOLDSTEIN: In fact, FDR's top economic advisers are saying to him, do not go off the gold standard. They basically felt the same way as Montagu Norman. Gold is the rock. It's holding everything together.

KESTENBAUM: But the U.S. is in the same bind that England was. If you stay on the gold standard, you got to keep raising interest rates, which is strangling the economy.

GOLDSTEIN: There is one guy advising FDR to leave the gold standard; a guy Liaquat Ahamed says was definitely not part of the economics establishment; a guy named George Warren.

AHAMED: FDR has been talking to this one crank, George Warren, who was his - who was a professor at Cornell who he had met because George Warren had helped him deal with some of his trees on his estate at Hyde Park.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDSTEIN: What - his trees?

AHAMED: Yeah. He had a problem with some of his trees, you know, that they were - I don't know - suffering from some disease.

GOLDSTEIN: You don't imagine calling an economist in when you have that problem.

AHAMED: Well, he was an agricultural economist. And Cornell had a very famous school of agricultural economics.

KESTENBAUM: You write that he's known as an expert on cows and chickens.

AHAMED: Exactly.

KESTENBAUM: So this expert on cows and chickens had actually published a huge monograph on how the gold standard affected commodity prices in the economy. And he said you've got to leave the gold standard. It's the only way.

GOLDSTEIN: And FDR took his advice.

AHAMED: FDR comes into the room in the White House, and all his advisors had gathered around. And he announces - by the way, we're off the gold standard. He had introduced the decision to go off gold as an amendment, a sort of minor clause into, I think it was the Agricultural Adjustment Act.

GOLDSTEIN: He snuck it in.

AHAMED: He snuck it in.

KESTENBAUM: And he sits there in this room with all his advisors and says, I know you think I can't do this, but here it is. We pass this thing.

AHAMED: And they all exploded, and Dean Acheson resigned over it. He was the assistant secretary of the treasury. And one guy, one of Roosevelt's advisors, told him that, you know, this is going to be the end of western civilization.

KESTENBAUM: And Roosevelt is just kind of winging it here. He has this idea from the guy who helped him with his trees that now that he's off the gold standard, his hands are freed, and he can fix this thing he thinks is a key problem - falling prices.

GOLDSTEIN: This is what economists called deflation. And we've talked about this a lot on the podcast. Deflation means prices are dropping. And this can lead you into this thing called the deflationary spiral where prices start falling so businesses, they have to cut people's wages. People are getting lower wages so they don't spend as much money. So that means prices have to fall some more. And this just keeps going on and on, back and forth in this downward spiral.

KESTENBAUM: And imagine a business. Say I'm thinking of opening a shoe factory. I need to borrow money to get started, but borrowing money seems scary because it's going to be really hard to pay that money back if the price of shoes keeps dropping; if I'm going to have to charge less and less each year for shoes. So I don't borrow the money. I don't build the factory, and I don't hire anyone.

GOLDSTEIN: So FDR looks at this, and he thinks, I've got to stop prices from falling. I've got to push prices up. And the price of gold, it's linked to the price of everything else. So FDR starts raising the price of gold. He has the government start buying more and more gold so that the price of gold goes up and up and up. And Liaquat Ahamed says Roosevelt does this over breakfast.

AHAMED: You know, he would have his whatever - boiled eggs and toast - and he'd be lying in bed. And these guys would come in, and he'd say so how much should we raise the price of gold today? And one day he said, let's do it by 21 cents. And the other said, why 21 cents? He said, well, seven times three and, you know, that sounds like a good number.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: It's my lucky number.

GOLDSTEIN: It's lucky.

AHAMED: Yeah, I mean, it's completely absurd. (Laughter) There was no economic rationale, although, he sort of conveyed the image that this was a very well-thought-out sort of well-conceived plan.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: So this works.

AHAMED: It did work. And the U.S. got out of the Great Depression. Almost, you know, most economists now agree, 90 percent of the reason why the U.S. got out of the Great Depression was the break with gold.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ROOSEVELT: After all, there is an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency, more important than gold. And that is the confidence of the people themselves.

KESTENBAUM: The Great Depression lasted for a long time after 1933, but 1933 - the year we went off the gold standard, that was the year things stopped getting worse and started getting better.

GOLDSTEIN: And as the economist Randall Parker points out, this was true all over the world.

PARKER: It's incredible and remarkable. The British left the gold standard in September of '31, and they instantly began to recover. We left the gold standard in March or April of 1933, we began to recover. The Spanish were never on the gold standard at all. They missed the great depression altogether.

GOLDSTEIN: You'd think Randall Parker is done, but he's not.

PARKER: President Takahashi at the Bank of Japan in 1931 saw trouble with the gold standard, took the Japanese off the gold standard in 1931. They recovered. The Belgians, the Pols and the French stayed on until 1936, long after we and England had left. And they continued to fall into the Great Depression until they left in 1936. So you look at the timing of this, when you recovered and when you left the gold standard are pretty much one to one.

KESTENBAUM: The great depression mortally wounded the gold standard, but it lived on in this strange sort of coma for decades.

GOLDSTEIN: After World War II, the world's big economic powers agreed to what became known as the Bretton Woods system. You can think of this as basically the world coming together and saying, yeah, OK, we know the gold standard blew up in our face, but we're actually too freaked out to get rid of gold altogether so we're going to make it work like this. The big currencies around the world, you can convert them into U.S. dollars at a fixed rate. And foreign governments, if they really want to, they can go to the U.S. government and trade their U.S. dollars for a fixed amount of gold.

KESTENBAUM: So that was there on paper as part of the agreement, but no one really did it in any sort of meaningful way, until the late 1960s when the economy started getting rocky again and people were worrying about inflation. Governments started making noises about trading in their dollars for gold. And just like in the 1930s, the president of the United States, this time Richard Nixon, says you know that thing about gold...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RICHARD NIXON: I directed Secretary Connelly to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets.

GOLDSTEIN: Even though Nixon says here this is temporary, it's not. On August 15, 1971, Nixon ends up pulling the plug on the gold standard once and for all.

KESTENBAUM: So here's a history of money in one sentence from the beginning of time to 1971. We started out with gold coins, we moved to paper bills where we said trust us, we've got gold in a vault, to now where we just say trust us.

GOLDSTEIN: And in particular, we say trust a bunch of guys in a room. Trust the economists at the Federal Reserve and their counterparts at central banks all over the world because now it's their job to decide what money should be worth.

KESTENBAUM: The gold standard, economists say, that was crazy. A bunch of guys in a room, OK, also crazy, but less crazy.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHELL GAMES")

BRIGHT EYES: (Singing) It's a shell game. It's a shell game.

GOLDSTEIN: To listen to all of the stories in our series on gold, visit the PLANET MONEY blog. That's at npr.org/money.

KESTENBAUM: And we really recommend the new NPR show Invisibilia. The latest episode is the story of a woman who has no fear. This is from some of the people who created This American Life and Radiolab - Lulu Miller and Alix Spiegel. You can get Invisibilia on iTunes or Stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts.

GOLDSTEIN: As always, email us at planetmoney@npr.org or visit us on Facebook to let us know what you think. I'm Jacob Goldstein.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
Hey Planet Money listeners, it's David.
Every so often we like to actually buy something in order to better understand it.
In 2010 we bought a toxic asset, you all named it Toxy, Toxy eventually died.
Next week we are going to buy something new, and to set the stage we are re-airing a couple
stories we did in 2011 when we bought a gold coin.
In the last episode we met a charming guy who made an argument for going back
to the gold standard.
Today we tell you what actually happened when the world was on a gold standard,
and why most economists think it's best we just put the whole thing behind us.
Here it is.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Jacob Goldstein, and I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today on the podcast, the story of a coded message that one of the world's most powerful
bankers totally does not understand.
Also the story of how Franklin Delano Roosevelt ignored the advice of America's big name
economists and listened instead to a guy who helped him take care of his trees.
Almost everyone we talked to about the gold standard told us that it is not just a
bad idea, it's actually a dangerous one.
Take for example the economist Randy Parker from East Carolina University, he seemed
like a very easy going guy, but when we asked him about the gold standard he
got all serious on us.
I think that it is a pernicious anachronism that should be kept in the history books,
and to think that modern people today want to speak about its resurrection should absolutely
horrify and terrify anyone who understands economics even a little bit.
He actually said it should die the death of a thousand stings.
He's not kidding around when it comes to the gold standard, and the reason he thinks
this and I don't know, say 99% of his colleagues think this and hate the gold
standard so much is they say it caused the modern world's worst financial disaster,
they say it caused the Great Depression.
And just to set the stage back then, all the key economic powers in the world,
England, France, Germany, the United States, even Japan, they are all on the gold standard.
Austria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, Norway,
New Zealand, even Australia, they are all on the gold standard.
I think you're doing circular breathing there, Kirsten, that was very impressive.
So now remember, in a way it's not that surprising because gold and money have
basically been synonymous forever.
You've got gold coins going back to 2000 BC and in England, they've been on some
form of the gold standard since the 1700s when Isaac Newton, yes that Isaac
Newton, ran the mint.
So that's the way things had been up until 1931, which is where we pick up
the story. In 1931, there's a man with a pointy beard who is running
England's central bank.
His name is Montague Norman.
So England is the most powerful economic force on earth at the time.
So he is the most important central banker on the planet.
And by all accounts, he's a very wise man, a very smart man and somewhat
eccentric.
We talked about Montague Norman with Liaquat Ahmed, who wrote a book
about this era called Lords of Finance.
In contrast to most bankers of the time who dressed in top hat and
frock coat and had long whiskers, he was a very unusual looking man.
He had this big black floppy hat, a cape, an emerald type in sort of
Van Dyke beard.
The New York Times described him as looking like the chief conspirator
out of an Italian opera.
Reporters loved Montague Norman and Montague Norman loved to hide
from reporters.
Ahmed writes that he once jumped over the side of a ship in high
seas to avoid the press, basically got into a dinghy and slipped
away before the ship got to port where the reporters had gathered.
Now, unfortunately for Montague Norman in 1931, reporters had a lot
of questions for him.
The world was falling apart.
Stock markets were way down.
Unemployment was way up.
Banks were collapsing.
And the gold standard was becoming a big problem.
So just to review the way the gold standard worked was that
every major currency in the world was backed by gold.
In the US, you could take $20.67 and the government had to give
you an ounce of gold.
In England, it was £4.86 for an ounce of gold.
That was fixed.
And in normal times, people didn't even really think about trading
in their money for gold.
They were perfectly happy with their paper dollars and their
paper pounds.
But of course, 1931 was not normal times.
People were saying, you know what?
I don't trust my paper pounds.
I'm freaked out.
I want gold.
The stock market crashed in the US.
Banks are going under.
I'm worried the whole financial system might crash.
So everybody started trading in their cash and demanding gold.
And this was a big problem for Montague Norman and the Bank of
England.
Because at some point, the Bank of England is going to run
out of gold.
So Montague Norman has to stop this.
And the only way to stop the rush of people converting their
pounds for gold is to raise interest rates.
Why raise interest rates?
Well, if you raise interest rates, that's an incentive for
people to hold on to their paper currency.
People will say, okay, I won't trade it in for gold.
If I keep it in the bank in England, I can earn all this
interest.
And this is why economists today look back and say the gold
standard was such a disaster.
In times of crisis, you want to be doing the exact opposite
of this.
You want to be lowering interest rates to make it easier
for businesses to borrow money and hire people to get
the economy going.
This is what we do now when we hit recessions.
Again, Lyaket Ahmed.
So you had this perverse system whereby in the middle
of the Great Depression, with 15% unemployment, countries
were raising interest rates.
And that is essentially what converted what was a terrible
depression into the Great Depression.
This is Montague Norman's dilemma.
He has to raise interest rates to keep gold in his
country.
But by raising interest rates, he's causing the Great
Depression.
Of course, Montague Norman does have another option,
right?
He could just say we're off the gold standard.
You can no longer trade in four pounds and 86 pence for an
ounce of gold.
This would solve his problem.
He wouldn't have to worry about the Bank of England
running out of gold, so he wouldn't have to keep raising
interest rates.
But for Montague Norman, the idea of going off the
gold standard was insane.
England was the world's biggest economic power and in
his mind, Britain's economy rested on the gold standard.
So what does Montague Norman do?
Faced with this choice between two impossible paths,
go off the gold standard or choke the economy by raising
interest rates?
What does he do?
He collapses.
The sort of pressures of the job got to him and he
collapsed one day.
Like loses consciousness?
Yeah, I mean he just couldn't get out of bed and
I don't quite know what all of the symptoms are of
a nervous breakdown, but he basically couldn't
function and would have terrible headaches and so
his doctor told him that you're going to have to
leave the country and go on a rest cure.
This is the most important central banker on the
planet at the time.
Yeah, during the worst financial crisis.
It's basically like Ben Bernanke taking a vacation
the day after Lehman Brothers goes bankrupt.
Yeah, or the week before actually.
So, you know, and Ben Bernanke's doctor is telling
him, God, you know, you're not functioning.
I'm afraid you're going to have to just leave
the country and go off somewhere.
I suppose he was worried that if he did the
wrong thing, he was going to bring the entirety
of civilization to a halt.
Well, that's exactly, you know, he thought that
the entire, the future of Western civilization
was in his hands.
So with the future of Western civilization in
his hands, Montague Norman gets on a ship
and takes a trip to Canada.
He writes in his diary, quote, feeling queer.
And then while he's gone, actually, while
he's on the ship on his way back home to
England, the people he's left in charge, they
decide, you know, we said we weren't going
to do this, but we have to do it.
We have to abandon the gold standard because
if we don't, we, the Bank of England, we're
going to run out of gold.
And they have to notify the boss, Montague Norman.
So they send Montague Norman this cable in
code.
Remember, he's on the ship coming home and
the cable reads, sorry, we have to go
off tomorrow and cannot wait to see you
before doing so.
And Montague Norman, he actually thinks this
just means, oh, my friend's going to be
out of the office when I get back.
But of course, what the cable means is
we're off the gold standard.
They're not leaving work early.
They're, they're taking one of the most
radical steps in the history of finance.
And not only is England catapulting itself
into this crazy new world where money is
just paper, they're also setting up what
will be a chain reaction around the
world.
So to understand this, imagine two people
in London the day before England goes
off the gold standard.
Both have 20 pounds in cash money.
One of them goes to the bank that day
and trades in his pounds for gold.
He gets about five ounces of gold, just
like it's always been.
The other guy, he holds on to his paper
money.
All right.
Next day, Montague Norman's colleagues
at the Bank of England drop the bomb.
Boom.
England's off the gold standard.
What that means in practice is that
when England cuts those strings tying
the pound to the gold standard,
the pound drops in value.
So this guy who traded in his
pounds for gold, he made a smart
move.
He did great.
His five ounces of gold are now
worth more than 20 pounds.
He just made money by getting rid of
his pounds before England went off the
gold standard.
The other guy, the guy who kept his
pounds, he's the sucker.
And obviously nobody wants to be a
sucker.
So people all over the world see
England go off the gold standard.
England, the mightiest economy in
the world.
And they worry, will my government
do the same thing?
Am I going to be the next sucker?
So as their economies get worse,
they start turning in their paper
money for gold, including people
here in the United States.
Because of undermined confidence
on the part of the public, there
was a general rush by a large
portion of our population to
turn bank deposits into currency
or gold.
This is FDR's first fireside
chat on March 12th, 1933.
The U.S. has just had the mother
of all bank runs.
People are afraid that banks are
going to fail.
So they're yanking their
dollars out and they're also
worried that the U.S. will
follow England and abandon the
gold standard.
So a lot of people are trading
in their dollars for gold.
People are hoarding cash and
gold.
And FDR is really upset about
that.
Let me make it clear to you that
the banks will take care of all
needs except, of course, the
hysterical demands of hoarders.
And it is my belief that
hoarding during the past week
has become an exceedingly
unfashionable pastime in every
part of our nation.
But FDR is actually about to
make a move that will take all
those unfashionable gold
hoarders and turn them into
winners.
Everybody who's not hoarding
gold, FDR is about to turn them
into suckers.
Here's Barry Eichengreen.
He's an economist at the
University of California,
Berkeley, and one of the
world experts on the Great
Depression and the gold
standard.
He's preparing to take the U.S.
off the gold standard.
He's preparing to say we will
no longer pay out gold at a
price of $20 an ounce.
You know what's amazing to
me?
He doesn't say, look, I know
a lot of people are really
attached to the gold standard.
It sounds like it makes sense,
but it doesn't make sense.
And I'm taking you off it.
He doesn't he doesn't say
that at all.
It's sort of in code.
Yeah, he is kind of tiptoeing
around the issue.
And that's for two reasons.
I think number one to say
the gold standard was a
disaster and we are abandoning
it for something better.
Stay tuned for what that is.
Wouldn't have been confidence
inspiring.
But the other part of the
answer is that Roosevelt was
kind of still grappling
toward a full response to
the crisis.
In fact, FDR's top economic
advisors are saying to him,
do not go off the gold
standard.
They basically felt the same
way as Montague Norman.
Gold is the rock.
It's holding everything
together.
But the U.S. is in the same
bind that England was.
If you stay on the gold
standard, you got to keep
raising interest rates, which
is strangling the economy.
There is one guy advising FDR
to leave the gold standard.
A guy, Liaquat Ahmed says,
was definitely not part of
the economics establishment.
A guy named George Warren.
FDR has been talking to this
one crank, George Warren,
who was a professor
at Cornell, who he'd
met because George Warren
had helped him deal
with some of his trees
on his estate at Hyde Park.
What, his trees?
Yeah, he had a problem
with some of his trees,
you know, that they were,
I don't know, they were
suffering from some disease.
You don't imagine calling
an economist in when you
have that.
He was an agricultural
economist, and Cornell
had a very famous school
of agricultural economics.
You're right that he's
known as an expert on
cows and chickens.
Exactly.
So this expert on cows
and chickens had actually
published a huge monograph
on how the gold standard
affected commodity prices
in the economy.
And he said, you got to
leave the gold standard.
It's the only way.
And FDR took his advice.
FDR comes into the room
in the White House, and
all his, all his advisers
are gathered around.
And he announces,
by the way, we're off
the gold standard.
He had introduced
the decision to go off
gold as an amendment,
a sort of minor clause
into, I think it was
the Agricultural Adjustment Act.
He snuck it in.
He snuck it in.
And he sits there in this
room with all his advisers
and says, I know you
think I can't do this,
but here it is.
We passed this thing.
And they all, they all
exploded and
Dean Atchison resigned over it.
He was the Assistant
Secretary of the Treasury.
And one guy, one of
Roosevelt's advisers,
told him that, you know,
this is going to be the
end of Western civilization.
And Roosevelt is just
kind of winging it here.
He has this idea from
the guy who helped him
with his trees,
that now that he's off
the gold standard,
his hands are freed,
and he can fix this thing
he thinks is a key problem,
falling prices.
This is what economists
call deflation.
And we've talked about
this a lot on the podcast.
Deflation means prices
are dropping.
And this can lead you
into this thing called
the deflationary spiral,
where prices start falling.
So businesses, they have
to cut people's wages.
People are getting lower
wages, so they don't
spend as much money.
So that means prices
have to fall some more.
And this just keeps
going on and on back
and forth in this
downward spiral.
And imagine a business.
Say I'm thinking of
opening a shoe factory.
I need to borrow money
to get started, but
borrowing money seems
scary because
it's going to be really
hard to pay that money
back if the price of
shoes keeps dropping,
if I'm going to have
to charge less and less
each year for shoes.
So I don't borrow the money.
I don't build a factory,
and I don't hire anyone.
So FDR looks at this,
and he thinks,
I've got to stop
prices from falling.
I've got to push
prices up.
And the price of gold,
it's linked to the price
of everything else.
So FDR starts raising
the price of gold.
He has the government
start buying more and
more gold so that
the price of gold goes
up and up and up.
And Liyachit Amit
says Roosevelt does
this over breakfast.
You know, he would have
his, whatever,
boiled eggs and toast,
and he'd be lying in
bed, and these guys
would come in.
And he'd say,
so how much should we
raise the price of
gold today?
And one day he said,
let's do it by 21 cents.
And the other said,
why 21 cents?
He said,
well, seven times three.
And you know,
that sounds like
a good number.
It's my lucky number.
Lucky.
Yeah.
I mean, it's completely
absurd.
There was no economic
rationale,
although he sort of
conveyed the image
that this was a very
well thought out,
sort of well-conceived
plan.
So this works.
It did work.
And the U.S.
got out of the
Great Depression
almost,
you know, most economists
now agree 90%
of the reason why the
U.S. got out of
the Great Depression
was the break with
gold.
After all,
there is an element
in the readjustment
of our financial
system,
more important than
currency,
more important than
gold.
And that is the
confidence of the
people themselves.
The Great Depression
lasted for a long
time after 1933,
but 1933,
the year we went off
the gold standard,
that was the year
things stopped getting
worse and started
getting better.
And as the economist
Randall Parker
points out,
this was true all
over the world.
It's incredible
and remarkable.
The British left
the gold standard
in September of 31
and they instantly
began to recover.
We left the gold
standard in March
or April of 1933.
We began to
recover.
The Spanish
were never on
the gold standard
at all.
They missed the
Great Depression
altogether.
You think Randall
Parker is done,
but he's not.
President
Ataka Hashi
at the Bank of
Japan in 1931
saw trouble with
the gold standard,
took the Japanese
off the gold standard
in 1931.
They recovered.
The Belgians,
the Poles,
and the French
stayed on until
1936,
long after we
and England had left
and they continued
to fall into the
Great Depression
until they left
in 1936.
So you look at
the timing of this
and when you
recovered
and when you left
the gold standard
are pretty much
one-to-one.
The Great Depression
mortally wounded
the gold standard,
but it lived on
in this strange
sort of coma
for decades.
After World War II,
the world's big
economic powers
agreed to what
became known as
the Bretton Woods
system.
You can think of
this as basically
the world coming
together and saying,
yeah, okay,
we know the gold
standard blew up
in our face,
but we're actually
still too freaked out
to get rid of
gold altogether.
So we're going to
make it work like this.
The big currencies
around the world,
you can convert them
into U.S. dollars
at a fixed rate.
And foreign governments,
if they really
want to,
they can go
to the U.S. government
and trade their
U.S. dollars
for a fixed
amount of gold.
So that was there
on paper as part
of the agreement,
but no one really
did it in any
sort of meaningful way.
Until the late 1960s,
when the economy
started getting
rocky again
and people were
worrying about
inflation.
Governments started
making noises
about trading in
their dollars
for gold.
And just like
in the 1930s,
the president of
the United States,
this time Richard Nixon,
says,
you know that
thing about gold?
I have directed
Secretary Connolly
to suspend temporarily
the convertibility
of the dollar
into gold
or other reserve
assets.
Even though Nixon
says here this
is temporary,
it's not.
On August 15th,
1971,
Nixon ends up
pulling the plug
on the gold standard
once and for all.
So here's a
history of money
in one sentence
from the beginning
of time to 1971.
We started out
with gold coins.
We moved to
paper bills
where we said
trust us.
We got gold
in a vault.
To now where
we just say
trust us.
And in particular,
we say
trust a bunch
of guys in a room.
Trust the economist
at the Federal Reserve
and their counterparts
at central banks
all over the world
because
now it's their job
to decide
what money
should be worth.
The gold standard
economists say
that was crazy.
A bunch of guys
in a room?
Okay,
also crazy,
but less crazy.
