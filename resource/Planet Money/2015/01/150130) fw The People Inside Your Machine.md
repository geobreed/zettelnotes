They are hundreds of thousands of people out there doing stuff to your internet that you probably think is automatic. They aren't computer programmers, they're just regular people working from their offices, homes and bedrooms. They are the people of Amazon Mechanical Turk.Amazon Mechanical Turk is an online marketplace for work. Businesses use it to farm out tiny little tasks like counting the number of people in a photo, and people around the world race to perform those tasks, sometimes for pennies.Today on the show, we sneak into the land of Mechanical Turk to meet the people inside.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Hey, NPR recommends that you check out Bullseye with Jesse Thron. Every week, Jesse interviews musicians, writers and filmmakers about their creative work and lives. You can find his show on iTunes, Stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts.

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

A few years ago, the company Amazon ran into this problem. They were working on something that sounds a lot like what Google Maps is right now. They basically had these trucks out on the streets, and they were driving around taking all of these pictures of businesses.

CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST:

Like hundreds of thousands of photos of - I don't know - like Larry's Laundromat, Dave's Donut Shop and the Kebab Hut.

CHACE: And for the map thing that they were doing, they had to pick the best picture. And picking the best picture sounds like it might be easy to do, but you have to pick the one that there's no dude walking by, it's from the front, you can see it very clearly. And that's something that's actually really hard for a computer to do - even the computers at Amazon.

JAMES BLAIR: Well, a computer - it's difficult for it to figure out exactly where is the edge of the store, what's cast in the best light, is there a glare that obstructs the sign? It's the type of task that requires judgment.

KENNEY: That James Blair. He works for Amazon. Now Amazon could have hired a room full of interns to do this. They could have outsourced the task to India, but they had this bigger idea. We have millions of people coming to our site every day to go shopping. Maybe some of them would want to earn a few bucks, go through the photos and choose the best one. It was a very tiny task.

BLAIR: Here's five pictures. They all, we think, are in front of Joe's Coffee Shop. Select the one that best represents this merchant.

CHACE: It's the world's smallest job offer. Pick the best picture, we'll pay you five cents.

KENNEY: And it worked. People all over the world wanted to do it. Isaac Nichols helped put this program together, and he remembers how fast it caught on. He told us they flipped the switch on a Wednesday night, and by Friday...

ISAAC NICHOLS: We had tens of thousands of people coming to the site Friday morning and work getting done literally faster than we could put it in for a time.

CHACE: Jeff Bezos, the founder and the CEO of Amazon, came up with the name for this project. He called it the Mechanical Turk. This is a very old expression that basically means a person pretending to be a machine.

NICHOLS: What Amazon figured out was there are all these people - hundreds of thousands of people, who were willing to do things that our computers just aren't very good at. And the people were willing to do these things for just pennies.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HEARD 'EM SAY")

KANYE WEST: (Singing) Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. West.

KENNEY: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Caitlin Kenney.

CHACE: And I'm Zoe Chace. Today on the show, we sneak into the world of the Mechanical Turks, and we find the people who live inside.

KENNEY: And it was not easy. Amazon won't tell you their names, so we had to leave them a secret message.

CHACE: Basically saying, hey, Turk.

KENNEY: Hey, Turk.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HEARD 'EM SAY")

WEST: (Singing) And I heard 'em say, nothing ever promised tomorrow today. But we'll find a way.

ADAM LEVINE: (Singing) Nothing lasts forever, but be honest babe. It hurts but it may be the only way.

CHACE: First, I want to explain the name - the Amazon Mechanical Turk - which is kind of a nutty thing but it is actually the perfect metaphor for what this is. The Mechanical Turk is a real thing from the 18th century. It was a clockwork machine - basically looked like a mannequin dressed in a Turkish robe that had a turban on its head, but in the front was this big box, right?

KENNEY: Yeah. And on top of the box there was this chessboard, basically. And the whole thing was that this machine was toured around Europe, essentially playing chess against other people and winning. And people were told and believed that they were getting beat at chess by machine. But actually, there was a person inside it. A person was doing the moves. It was a person beating everyone else.

CHACE: And that is exactly what the website Amazon Mechanical Turk is today. It's actual humans doing stuff to the Internet that you probably think is automatic. Like behind your screen, there are actually a whole bunch of people who are sort of smoothing the Internet out and making it work.

KENNEY: When Amazon first built Mechanical Turk, it was just for themselves to solve problems that they had. But they started letting other companies use it too. And today, it's used by all different types of folks.

CHACE: Right, like Twitter uses it to make their search results in real-time much better, and there's a clothing company.

KENNEY: Yeah, there's a website, Gilt Groupe, they have daily deals on clothing. They use it to try to predict which dresses or shoes or handbags are going to sell the best.

CHACE: But finding the Turkers and talking to them - it is tricky. Like there is no phonebook, there's not like a centralized location. The Turkers all go by these just random ID numbers, like license plates - just, you know, A24601. Basically, a company just posts a task and an anonymous crowd does it for them.

KENNEY: We wanted to meet the anonymous crowds, so we figured what better way to do that than to post our own task and have people do it for us. Then we could talk to the people who did it and ask them who they are and what their story is.

CHACE: This was the big idea, but actually, Amazon Mechanical Turk the website is kind of complicated and a little bit confusing. So we called that guy Isaac, who helped start the program ten years ago, and now he runs a consultancy called zCrowd. He helps people use this website, and he walked us through it.

NICHOLS: The whole experience of using Mechanical Turk is very much like using a computer. You know, you ask your computer a question and out on the other side you get an answer. You put some input in and you get back a result.

CHACE: In order to use Amazon Turk correctly, Isaac says the question that you ask needs to be what he calls a human question - one that is hard for machines to answer, but super easy for humans.

KENNEY: So we were sitting here at the office thinking about, OK, what problems do we have? How could we use Mechanical Turk? And we realized that, you know, we have something like 600 episodes of PLANET MONEY.

CHACE: Yeah.

KENNEY: And we actually never bothered to write down who hosted each episode.

CHACE: 'Cause we thought we'd always remember.

KENNEY: Yeah, of course. But, you know, a lot's changed in the years that we've been doing PLANET MONEY. We've had a number of different staff come and go, we've had a bunch of guest hosts.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCASTS)

MARIANNE MCCUNE, BYLINE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Marianne McCune.

ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE: And I'm Adam Davidson.

MARA ZEPEDA, BYLINE: And I'm Mara Zepeda.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, BYLINE: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

MARLON BISHOP, BYLINE: And I'm Marlon Bishop.

LISA CHOW, BYLINE: And I'm Lisa Chow.

GABRIELLE EMANUEL, BYLINE: And I'm Gabrielle Emanuel.

KENNEY: So we could have a computer do this, right? Voice recognition software exists, but it's hard for it to work with all different voices and it's hard for it to pick out names. Humans, on the other hand, could do this task really easily.

CHACE: So we figured we could send links to all our episodes to the Turks and have them listen to the first couple minutes, write down who was hosting, and then we'd be able to tag the episode so that you, the listeners, can search our archive by host.

KENNEY: But we did something sneaky.

CHACE: Yes.

KENNEY: In that list with the links to the audio of each episode, we included a couple fake ones - not actual episodes of PLANET MONEY - a secret message from me and Zoe.

KENNEY: Hi, Turk.

CHACE: Hello, my Turk. This is Zoe Chace.

KENNEY: And I'm Caitlin Kenney. Zoe and I work together. We're reporters at National Public Radio in New York City. And we want to talk to you about what your job is like. What's it like being a Turk?

CHACE: We want to know what it's like to be a Turk. So can you just send us an email and let us know how to reach you? Just tell us whatever way you're comfortable with. Send us your email address or your phone number, your Skype, your Twitter, your WhatsApp - however it is that we can get in touch with you.

CHACE: OK, so that was our secret message and that was our big task. And Isaac helped us figure out how much to pay people to do it. On Amazon Mechanical Turk, there are no rules about this - how much you have to pay people. And we figured, what? It will take a few minutes.

KENNEY: So I don't know, like 75 cents?

NICHOLS: I think you're being probably a little on the generous side.

KENNEY: The jobs you post on Amazon Mechanical Turk are called HITS - human intelligence tasks. So with Isaac's help, we decide on 60 cents a hit.

CHACE: OK.

KENNEY: Are we up?

CHACE: Its status says in progress.

KENNEY: Yay.

NICHOLS: You are now working with the crowd.

KENNEY: All right, crowd, get to work.

CHACE: We did not tell Isaac about the secret message. That's just between us.

KENNEY: So write to us, hellomyturk@gmail.com.

CHACE: Talk to you soon.

KENNEY: Thanks.

When you post a task on Mechanical Turk, you don't see the work being done. So we just had to wait for the results to come in. And it happened superfast.

CHACE: Yeah.

KENNEY: All these spreadsheets came back with our episodes and the names next to them. It was like the whole thing had been done by a computer.

CHACE: But, of course, it wasn't.

KENNEY: All right, we're rolling?

CHACE: Yeah.

KENNEY: OK, let's go.

(SOUNDBITE OF SKYPE CALL)

ASHLEY TAGGARD: Hi.

CHACE: Hello.

TAGGARD: Hello.

CHACE: Is this our Turk?

TAGGARD: This is your Turk. (Laughter).

CHACE: Yay. (Laughter).

KENNEY: We were so nervous that no one was going to back to us that it was actually really exciting to hear from people. This is Ashley Taggard. She's 29 years old. She lives in Northern California, and she did our task.

(SOUNDBITE OF SKYPE CALL)

CHACE: Did you happen to hear a secret message from me and Caitlin?

TAGGARD: The one about Turks - Turkers, that one?

CHACE: Yes.

KENNEY: Yeah.

TAGGARD: Yeah, I heard that.

CHACE: I can't believe you heard it. What did - what - OK, what did you think?

TAGGARD: I didn't know what to think. But it sounded safe enough so I responded.

CHACE: There were a lot of people. We found Matthew in Canton, Ohio. We found Manju in Bangalore, Kristopher Watson in Indianapolis.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE CALL)

KENNEY: Hello, are you our Turk?

KRISTOPHER WATSON: Yes.

KENNEY: You did our task?

WATSON: Yeah, quite a few times.

CHACE: Thirty people did our task, and we heard back from 22 of them. And they were all kinds of people. Like, one of them was a vet. She had just gotten back from Iraq. She said the job she had was the job in "The Hurt Locker." And now she was trying to figure out what to do next. There were college students, grad students.

KENNEY: And even though people all over the world could apply for a job, most of the people who did our task where in the U.S. And they were doing the work all over the place. Some people were doing it from their offices while they were at their day jobs. Other people were doing it at home in their bedroom.

KENNEY: Do you always put on, I don't know, work clothes?

WATSON: No. I, like right now, I've got sweats and a sweatshirt. You don't want to over-dress because if you're submitting a hit every, you know, 10, 20 seconds, you might get hot.

CHACE: The Turks that we talked to, like, they are oddballs, OK. They had their own little quirks and funny way of doing things, right, like...

KENNEY: Yeah. I mean, we didn't get to talk to everyone who did our task, but the people we talked to, they seemed to have this one thing in common. And that was, you know, for whatever reason, it was hard for them to be out there in the regular workforce. Like Matthew, who we talked to in Ohio, he just didn't want to be part of it.

MATTHEW: It's enough to say my temperament and the job market don't really see eye to eye.

CHACE: Ashley in California, she describes herself as a recluse.

TAGGARD: I've kind of had a problem with anxiety for most of my life. And so I didn't like to leave the house, and so I'm kind of behind where everybody else is at my age.

KENNEY: Ashley, as you can tell, is the perfect candidate for working at home because she's super anxious. She told us that she forced herself to get a job at the Taco Bell drive-through recently. But she can't stand doing it. She hates being out in public and having to talk to people all the time. So she started using Amazon Mechanical Turk trying to make some extra money filling in these weird little corners of the Internet.

CHACE: On Mechanical Turk, any kind of social awkwardness does not hurt the workers there. They're just faceless numbers to the people who employ them. All that matters on Mechanical Turk is their speed and their accuracy.

KENNEY: We wanted to know exactly what this world looks like. What's it like to turk? So we asked Ashley to show us. She's behind a lot of the things that I always thought just computers did.

TAGGARD: Last night, I stayed on for probably about four or five hours because there was a really good hit up, and I was, you know, on it. And I made like $45.

CHACE: This hit, this task came from Amazon. It is a classic you-thought-this-was-software-but-actually-it-is-a-person-behind-the-machine type of task.

KENNEY: You know when you buy things on Amazon, they have all these suggestions for other things you can buy? And I always thought that those suggestions came from some supercomputer up in Seattle.

CHACE: Right, of course, but it's actually Ashley. Like, it is partly Ashley. A human has to go in and make sure that you don't get some crazy suggestion that has nothing to do with what you're really buying at that moment. So what Ashley does is she looks at two different products and says, OK, are these two things similar or not?

KENNEY: What was the wackiest thing you saw that you were like, oh, that doesn't fit?

TAGGARD: There was some crazy thing. I think it - I can't remember - I think it was a camera and then it was a bag of dog food. It was just really off the wall, you know, like, which is nice because it's real easy. I can look at that in a second and know exactly what button to hit and, you know, and be done with it.

CHACE: Not similar, boom 33 cents.

KENNEY: This job that Ashley has, I mean, if you think about it, it's like this extreme example of how technology is changing jobs and changing work for everyone really because the kind of thing she's doing, you know, inputting information, that used to be someone's full-time job here in America.

CHACE: Yeah, I had a job like that. One summer, I was doing data entry. I just went to UPenn. I had to call up pharmacies and see if they had this drug and put in a spreadsheet. And it's not like it was awesome. Like, it was not fun, but it had the stuff that jobs have. Like, I knew I was supposed to be there every morning. I knew that I was going to get paid minimum wage every two weeks. And when I think about what Ashley is doing, it's like taking the job that I did and breaking up each little entry into a million pieces and just paying per piece. That's a way worse job. That is way harder to do.

KENNEY: I mean, it's basically like Ashley has a version of your job, but it's like jacked up on speed, right. She has no idea how much work there's going to be for her tomorrow or the next day. She doesn't know how much she's going to get paid for the work. She doesn't know what to expect. There's no promise of future work. And there's intense competition for the little work that's out there. Like, every five-cent task that's posted, anybody who signed up for the service and has access to the Internet can go after the same job she can.

TAGGARD: Here's an 11-minute survey for a $1.10, doesn't tell you what it is, from the Wharton School. They put a lot of hits out. Let's - want to see what it is? I'm kind of curious. Oh, they're already gone. See, there are no more hits available. So they're already gone.

KENNEY: Someone else beat you to it.

TAGGARD: Yeah.

KENNEY: Does that happen a lot?

TAGGARD: Yeah, it does.

KENNEY: Imagine that the second you saw a job post online, you clicked on it to apply and, bam, it was gone. Somebody already took it. Now imagine this happening to you every five seconds for hours.

CHACE: In the real labor market, there is what we call friction - resumes, phone calls, in-person job interviews, buying a suit, salary negotiations. But here on Mechanical Turk, everything happens in seconds.

KENNEY: A job is posted and then...

TAGGARD: Yeah, it's gone. It's gone again. So I'll go back over year.

KENNEY: And you can imagine what this competition does to the price. All these hundreds of thousands of workers racing for the same job. They're driving the price down; the price of themselves because the companies who post work on Mechanical Turk know that if all their tasks are getting snapped up right away, they can pay less them so they'll lower the price.

CHACE: Couple days after we talked to Ashley, we checked back in.

TAGGARD: Today, I've earned 12 cents. And yesterday I earned $1.81. And then I had a $10.50 day. That was good.

CHACE: That was Christmas day.

TAGGARD: Yeah. I didn't add that.

(LAUGHTER)

CHACE: OK, but seriously, it is sad. The money situation on Amazon Mechanical Turk, it is brutal. This is a superhard, low-paying job. It's piecework. Ashley hopes to make $6 an hour, which means her goal is to make less than the minimum wage.

TAGGARD: It beats the hell out of nothing, which is my alternative so - but I never make $6 an hour. It's just real hard. It's real hard.

KENNEY: Of the people we talked to who did our task, most of them told us they use Amazon Mechanical Turk to supplement their income. They have other jobs. Only one of them told us he's making enough to do it full-time. It's really hard to make a living this way. And the people that we talked to, they're not making Amazon Mechanical Turk their long-term bet. It's just kind of a placeholder because they can see that more and more people are signing up for the site. And that means fewer good-paying jobs for them.

CHACE: And it's not just the Turks who are racing each other for these little jobs. The computers are always gaining on them. Software gets better all the time. And it's better able to do stuff that only Mechanical Turks used to be able to do like recognize what's in a picture, transcribe speech, make decisions. The more stuff that computers can do, the fewer jobs there are for the Mechanical Turks. And Ashley feels this. In fact, she often gets these tasks were her main job is to teach a computer what to do.

KENNEY: With enough information, you can automate all kinds of jobs, even something we think of as inherently human, like a doctor talking to a patient. The other night, Ashley got this task. It seemed to be asking her to train a computer to sound like a real doctor.

>>TAGGARD And they're trying to train the computer physician how to word things, like how a real doctor would word something.

KENNEY: She was given this scenario. OK, say you're a doctor, and you have a patient who hurt their leg. How do you ask how they're doing? A computer might say, how is your leg? But a real doctor could say it a whole number of ways. So the task was for Ashley to give five different options for how the computer doctor could ask.

TAGGARD: I would type in something like, is your leg better today? Have you noticed an improvement in your leg today? (Laughter). Literally, this is how you do it. You know, how about early - during the week, did your leg feel like it was doing better?

CHACE: You're really helping a computer to be more like you. Like, you're teaching that computer to be like you are.

TAGGARD: Yeah. Exactly. And it even says that in there. They want a human response.

CHACE: A human response. And a task like this shows how Amazon Turk might be changing. It started out as a place for very tiny tasks; the kind of jobs that most people might not want to do anyway, like choosing the best picture of Joe's Coffee Shop.

But now it's a place where Turks are teaching computers to do more and more complicated jobs. So if in your job you're required to sound like a human and have a human response to other people, that might be something the Turks are teaching computers to do instead of you right now. Like, what about like this, right? Like, what if right now, some Turk is out there training a computer to be a podcast host going, like, how is the economy doing today?

KENNEY: The economy looked bad last week. Is it doing better?

CHACE: (Laughter) How do you feel about the economy?

KENNEY: Do you feel the economy is worse or better than yesterday?

CHACE: Exactly, like, OK, so that's what I'm saying. Just sounding human, responding like a human, that is a big part of our job.

KENNEY: And if someone could teach a computer to sound like us, well, that's a problem for us.

CHACE: Yeah. Mechanical Turk has been around for 10 years. And when we were talking to Isaac Nichols, the guy who helped up set up our task, we asked him what do you make of the system that you created 10 years ago? Is it too cutthroat a place? Is it just too cheap?

NICHOLS: The problem right now with Mechanical Turk is it was designed with this sort of open-ended nature. There were no rules, and we didn't know, you know - it was constructed in a way to allow for people to experiment. And now, you know, it's been a decade since it launched, and it's time for, you know, a, you know, some rules to be put into place. But what those rules are, though, you know, I don't know.

KENNEY: The Turks have some ideas about what the rules should be. And even though they were designed to be anonymous, they found each other. They talk to each other on forums. They help each other navigate the system, find shortcuts, figure out how to find the best hits. They came up with this public review site, Turk Opticon, to review people who post jobs for them.

CHACE: Over Christmas, a bunch of Turks wrote this big public letter to Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon. And one thing that it said was, quote, "please stop selling us as nothing more than an algorithm, and instead, introduce those who use your service to the fact that we are living, breathing beings."

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HEARD 'EM SAY")

WEST: (Singing) Before you ask me to go get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage? And I know the government administer AIDs so I guess we just pray like the minister say.

KENNEY: Now that our task has been done, we can start tagging our episodes with the names of the hosts for each show.

CHACE: And you can thank Ashley for that and Matthew and Kris and Wang Xue Hang (ph) and Manju and Hazel.

KENNEY: And Gina and William and Michael and Meg and Cheryl and Ryan and Sindhu and Tanya.

CHACE: And David and Samantha and Brandy and Anita.

KENNEY: Grant, Xian Leo and Josh. Thanks.

CHACE: Thanks. And special thanks today also to Ronik Sheth (ph) with FoodEssentials, Rena Lunak with Amazon and a bunch of other Mechanical Turks that we talked to online who helped us with this story. Our show was produced by Phia Bennin.

KENNEY: We'd love to hear what you thought of today's show. You can email us, planetmoney@npr.org. Or you can find us on Facebook or Twitter or Spotify.

CHACE: And I just want to take a moment here to seriously thank you guys for listening because this is one of my last shows at PLANET MONEY. I'm moving on for a little while, and so I need you to indulge me here for a second because I love PLANET MONEY so much.

And what I wanted to say is that when I came to PLANET MONEY, which was three years ago, it had already started, like, it had been a show, been around for three years. And the table was all set, the party was, like, going on, there were all these dedicated listeners and brilliant staff members. And everybody has just been so generous and welcoming with me. And so what happened was I proceeded to learn pretty much everything that I know about radio and economics from the people here at PLANET MONEY. And I know that you guys know what that's like because that's been your experience as well. So thank you for listening. Seriously, I love you guys.

KENNEY: We are all bummed to see Zoe go, but I guarantee this will not be the last time you hear her on PLANET MONEY. We are committed to having her back. You know we work closely with This American Life, but she will no longer be sitting right beside us, which we are sad about. All right, Zoe. I'm Caitlin Kenney.

CHACE: And I'm Zoe Chace. Thanks for listening.

KENNEY: Thanks.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HEARD 'EM SAY")

WEST: (Singing) And I heard them say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.

LEVINE: (Singing) Nothings ever promised tomorrow today.

WEST: (Singing) But we'll find a way.

LEVINE: (Singing) And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe. It hurts but it may be the only way.

WEST: (Singing) They say people in your life are seasons, and anything that happen is for a reason.

Hey, NPR recommends that you check out Bullseye with Jesse Thorne.
Every week, Jesse interviews musicians, writers, and filmmakers about their creative work and
lives.
You can find his show on iTunes, Stitcher, or wherever you get your podcasts.
A few years ago, the company Amazon ran into this problem.
They were working on something that sounds a lot like what Google Maps is right now.
They basically had these trucks out on the streets and they were driving around

Like hundreds of thousands of photos of, I don't know, Larry's laundry mat, Dave's donut

And for the map thing that they were doing, they had to pick the best picture.
And picking the best picture sounds like it might be easy to do, but you have
to pick the one that there's no dude walking by, it's from the front, you can see it
very clearly, and that's something that's actually really hard for a computer to do.
Even the computers at Amazon.
For a computer, it's difficult for it to figure out exactly where's the edge of the store,
what's cast in the best light, is there glare that obstructs the sign?
It's the type of task that requires judgment.

We have millions of people coming to our site every day to go shopping.

the one that best represents this merchant.
It's the world's smallest job offer.
Pick the best picture, we'll pay you five cents.
And it worked, people all over the world wanted to do it.
Isaac Nichols helped put this program together, and he remembers how fast it caught on.
He told us they flipped the switch on a Wednesday night, and by Friday?
We had tens of thousands of people coming to the site Friday morning and work getting
done literally faster than we could put it in for a time.
Jeff Bezos, the founder and the CEO of Amazon, came up with the name for this

This is a very old expression that basically means a person pretending to be a

thousands of people who are willing to do things that our computers just aren't
very good at. And the people were willing to do these things for just pennies.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Caitlin Kenny.
And I'm Zoe Chase. Today on the show, we sneak into the world of the mechanical
Turks and we find the people who live inside.
And it was not easy. Amazon won't tell you their names, so we had to leave
them a secret message.
Basically saying, hey Turk, hey Turk.
First, I want to explain the name, the Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is kind of a
nutty thing, but it is actually the perfect metaphor for what this is.
The Mechanical Turk is a real thing from the 18th century.
It was a clockwork machine, basically looked like a mannequin dressed in a
Turkish robe that had a turban on its head.
But in the front was this big box, right?
Yeah. And on top of the box, there was this chessboard, basically.
And the whole thing was that this machine, which is a mechanical turk,
was that this machine was toured around Europe, essentially playing chess against
other people and winning.
And people were told and believed that they were getting beat at chess by a
machine. But actually, there was a person inside it.
A person was doing the moves.
It was a person beating everyone else.
And that is exactly what the website Amazon Mechanical Turk is today.
It's actual humans doing stuff to the Internet that you probably think is
automatic. Like behind your screen, there are actually a whole bunch of
people who are sort of smoothing the Internet out and making it work.
When Amazon first built Mechanical Turk, it was just for themselves to solve
problems that they had. But they started letting other companies use it, too.
And today, it's used by all different types of folks.
Right. Like Twitter uses it to make their search results in real time much
better. And there's a clothing company.
Yeah, there's a website, Gilt Group.
They have daily deals on clothing.
They use it to try to predict which dresses or shoes or handbags are going
to sell the best.
But finding the Turkers and talking to them, it is tricky.
There is no phone book.
There's not like a centralized location.
The Turkers all go by these just random ID numbers like license plates.
Just, you know, A24601.
Basically, a company just posts a task and an anonymous crowd does it for
them. We wanted to meet the anonymous crowd.
So we figured what a better way to do that than to post our own task and
have people do it for us.
And then we can talk to the people who did it and ask them who they are
and what their story is.
This is the big idea.
But actually, Amazon Mechanical Turk, the website, is kind of complicated and a
little bit confusing.
So we called that guy Isaac, who helped start the program 10 years ago.
And now he runs a consultancy called Z Crowd.
He helps people use this website and he walked us through it.
The whole experience of using Mechanical Turk is very much like using
a computer. You know, you ask your computer a question and out on the
other side, you get an answer.
You put some input in and you get you get back a result.
In order to use Amazon Turk correctly, Isaac says the question that you ask
needs to be what he calls a human question, one that is hard for machines
to answer, but super easy for humans.
So we're sitting here at the office thinking about, OK, like, what
problems do we have?
How can we use Mechanical Turk?
And we realized that, you know, we have something like 600 episodes of
Planet Money. And we actually never bothered to write down who hosted
each episode because we thought we'd always remember.
Yeah, of course. But, you know, a lot's changed in the years that we've
been doing Planet Money. We've had a number of different staff come and go.
We've had a bunch of guest hosts.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Mary Ann McCune and I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Mata Zepeda
and I'm Khanna Joffrey-Walt and I'm Marlon Bishop and I'm Lisa Cho
and I'm Gabriella Emanuel.
So we could have a computer do this, right?
Voice recognition software exists, but it's hard for it to work
with all different voices and it's hard for it to pick out names.
Humans, on the other hand, could do this task really easily.
So we figured we could send links to all our episodes to the Turks
and have them listen to the first couple of minutes, write down
who is hosting, and then we'd be able to tag the episode
so that you, the listeners, can search our archive by host.
But we did something sneaky.
Yes. In that list with the links to the audio of each episode,
we included a couple fake ones, not actual episodes of Planet Money.
A secret message from me and Zoe.
Hi, Turk.
Hello, my Turk. This is Zoe Chase.
And I'm Caitlin Kenny.
Zoe and I work together.
We're reporters at National Public Radio in New York City.
And we want to talk to you about what your job is like.
What's it like being a Turk?
We want to know what it's like to be a Turk.
So can you just send us an email and let us know how to reach you?
Just tell us whatever way you're comfortable with.
Send us your email address or your phone number, your Skype,
your Twitter, your WhatsApp.
However, it is that we can get in touch with you.
OK, so that was our secret message.
And that was our big task.
And Isaac helped us figure out how much to pay people to do it.
On Amazon Mechanical Turk, there are no rules about this.
How much you have to pay people.
And we figured, what?
It'll take a few minutes.
So, I don't know, like 75 cents.
I think you're being probably a little on the generous side.
The jobs you post on Amazon Mechanical Turk are called HITs,
human intelligence tasks.
So with Isaac's help, we decide on 60 cents a HIT.
OK. Are we up?
Its status says in progress.
Yay.
You are now working with the crowd.
All right, crowd, get to work.
We did not tell Isaac about the secret message.
That's just between us.
So write to us.
Hello, my Turk at gmail.com.
Talk to you soon.
Thanks.
When you post a task on Mechanical Turk,
you don't see the work being done.
So we just had to wait for the results to come in.
And it happened super fast.
All these spreadsheets came back with our episodes
and the names next to them.
It was like the whole thing had been done by a computer.
But of course, it wasn't.
OK, rolling?
Yeah.
Hello?
Hello.
Is this our Turk?
This is your Turk.
Yay.
We were so nervous that no one was going to get back to us,
that it was actually really exciting to hear from people.
This is Ashley Taggart.
She's 29 years old.
She lives in Northern California.
And she did our task.
Did you happen to hear a secret message from me and Caitlin?
The one about Turk, the Turk-er?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard that.
I can't believe you heard it.
OK, what did you think?
I didn't know what to think.
But it sounded safe enough, so I responded.
There were a lot of people.
We found Matthew in Canton, Ohio.
We found Manju in Bangalore.
Christopher Watson in Indianapolis.
Hello, are you our Turk?
Yes.
You did our task.
Yeah, quite a few times.
30 people did our task, and we heard back from 22 of them.
And they were all kinds of people.
Like, one of them was a vet.
She had just gotten back from Iraq.
She said the job she had was the job in the Hurt Locker.
And now she was trying to figure out what to do next.
There were college students, grad students.
And even though people all over the world
could apply for our job, most of the people who did our task
were in the US.
And they were doing the work all over the place.
Some people were doing it from their offices
while they were at their day jobs.
Other people were doing it at home in their bedroom.
Do you always put on, I don't know, work clothes?
You know, like right now, I got on sweats and a sweatshirt.
You don't want to overdress,
because if you're submitting the hit every 10, 20 seconds,
you might get hot.
The Turks that we talked to, like, they are oddballs, OK?
They have their own little quirks and funny way
of doing things, right?
Yeah, I mean, we didn't get to talk to everyone
who did our task.
But the people we talked to,
they seemed to have this one thing in common.
And that was, you know, for whatever reason,
it was hard for them to be out there
in the regular workforce.
Like Matthew, who we talked to in Ohio,
he just didn't want to be part of it.
It's enough to say my temperament
and the job market don't really see eye to eye.
Ashley, in California, she describes herself as a recluse.
I've kind of had a problem with anxiety
for most of my life.
And so I didn't like to leave the house.
And so I'm kind of behind where everybody else is at my age.
Ashley, as you can tell,
is the perfect candidate for working at home
because she's super anxious.
She told us that she forced herself to get a job
at the Taco Bell drive through recently,
but she can't stand doing it.
She hates being out in public
and having to talk to people all the time.
So she started using Amazon Mechanical Turk,
trying to make some extra money
filling in these weird little corners of the internet.
On Mechanical Turk, any kind of social awkwardness
does not hurt the workers there.
They're just faceless numbers
to the people who employ them.
All that matters on Mechanical Turk
is their speed and their accuracy.
We wanted to know exactly what this world looks like.
What's it like to Turk?
So we asked Ashley to show us.
She's behind a lot of the things
that I always thought just computers did.
Last night I stayed on for probably about four or five
hours because there was a really good hit up
and I was on it and I made like $45.
This hit, this task came from Amazon.
It is a classic, you thought this was software,
but actually it is a person behind the machine
type of task.
You know when you buy things on Amazon,
they have all these suggestions
for other things you can buy.
And I always thought that those suggestions
came from some super computer up in Seattle.
Right, of course, but it's actually Ashley.
Like it is partly Ashley.
A human has to go in and make sure
that you don't get some crazy suggestion
that has nothing to do with what you're really buying
at that moment.
So what Ashley does is she looks at two different products
and says, okay, are these two things similar or not?
What was the wackiest thing you saw
that you were like, oh, that doesn't fit?
There was some crazy thing.
I think it was a camera and then it was a bag
of dog food.
It was just really off the wall.
You know, which is nice because it's real easy.
I can look at that in a second
and know exactly what button to hit
and be done with it.
Not similar.
Boom, 33 cents.
This job that Ashley has, I mean, if you think about it,
it's like this extreme example
of how technology is changing jobs
and changing work for everyone really.
Because the kind of thing she's doing,
you know, inputting information,
that used to be someone's full-time job
here in America.
Yeah, I had a job like that.
One summer I was doing data entry.
I just went to UPenn.
I had to call up pharmacies
and see if they had this drug
and put it in a spreadsheet.
And it's not like it was awesome.
It was not fun,
but it had the stuff that jobs have.
I knew I was supposed to be there every morning.
I knew that I was gonna get paid
minimum wage every two weeks.
And when I think about what Ashley is doing,
it's like taking the job that I did
and breaking up each little entry
into a million pieces
and just paying per piece.
That's a way worse job.
That is way harder to do.
I mean, it's basically like
Ashley has a version of your job,
but it's like jacked up on speed, right?
She has no idea how much work
there's gonna be for her tomorrow or the next day.
She doesn't know how much
she's gonna get paid for the work.
She doesn't know what to expect.
There's no promise of future work.
And there's intense competition
for the little work that's out there.
Like every five cent task that's posted,
anybody who signed up for the service
and has access to the internet
can go after the same job she can.
Here's an 11 minute survey for $1.10.
Doesn't tell you what it is from the Wharton School.
They put a lot of hits out.
Wanna see what it is?
I'm kinda curious.
Oh, they're already gone.
See, there are no more hits available.
So they're already gone.
Someone else beat you to it.
Yeah, yeah.
Does that happen a lot?
Yeah, it does.
Imagine that the second you saw a job post online,
you clicked on it to apply and bam, it was gone.
Somebody already took it.
Now imagine this happening to you
every five seconds for hours.
In the real labor market,
there is what we call friction.
Resumes, phone calls, in-person job interviews,
buying a suit, salary negotiations.
But here on Mechanical Turk,
everything happens in seconds.
A job is posted and then?
Yeah, it's gone.
It's gone again.
So I'll come back over here.
And you can imagine what this competition
does to the price.
All these hundreds of thousands of workers
racing for the same job.
They're driving the price down.
The price of themselves.
Because the companies who post work on Mechanical Turk
know that if all their tasks
are getting snapped up right away,
they can pay less for them.
So they'll lower the price.
Couple days after we talked to Ashley,
we checked back in.
Today I've earned 12 cents.
And yesterday I earned $1.81.
And then I had a 10.50 day.
That was good.
That was Christmas day.
Yeah, sad, isn't that sad?
Yeah.
Okay, but seriously, it is sad.
The money situation on Amazon Mechanical Turk,
it is brutal.
This is a super hard, low paying job.
It's piecework.
Ashley hopes to make $6 an hour.
Which means her goal is to make less
than the minimum wage.
It beats the hell out of nothing,
which is my alternative.
But I never make $6 an hour.
It's real hard.
It's real hard.
Of the people we talked to who did our task,
most of them told us they use Amazon Mechanical Turk
to supplement their income.
They have other jobs.
Only one of them told us he's making enough
to do it full time.
It's really hard to make a living this way.
And the people that we talked to,
they're not making Amazon Mechanical Turk
their long term bet.
It's just kind of a placeholder.
Because they can see that more and more people
are signing up for the site.
And that means fewer good paying jobs for them.
And it's not just the Turks who are racing each other
for these little jobs.
The computers are always gaining on them.
Software gets better all the time.
And it's better able to do stuff
that only Mechanical Turks used to be able to do,
like recognize what's in a picture,
transcribe speech, make decisions.
The more stuff that computers can do,
the fewer jobs there are for the Mechanical Turks.
And Ashley feels this.
In fact, she often gets these tasks
where her main job is to teach a computer what to do.
With enough information,
you can automate all kinds of jobs.
Even something we think of as inherently human,
like a doctor talking to a patient.
The other night, Ashley got this task
that seemed to be asking her to train a computer
to sound like a real doctor.
And they're trying to train the computer physician
how to word things,
like how a real doctor would word something.
She was given this scenario.
Okay, say you're a doctor
and you have a patient who hurt their leg.
How do you ask how they're doing?
A computer might say, how is your leg?
But a real doctor could say it a whole number of ways.
So the task was for Ashley to give five different options
for how the computer doctor could ask.
I would type in something like,
is your leg better today?
Have you noticed an improvement in your leg?
Literally, this is how you do it.
You know, how about early,
during the week, did your leg feel
like it was doing better?
You're really helping a computer to be more like you.
Like you're teaching that computer to be like you are.
Yeah, exactly.
And it even says that in there.
They want a human response.
A human response.
And a task like this shows
how Amazon Turk might be changing.
It started out as a place for very tiny tasks.
The kind of jobs that most people
might not wanna do anyway,
like choosing the best picture of Joe's coffee shop.
But now it's a place where Turks are teaching computers
to do more and more complicated jobs.
So if in your job,
you're required to sound like a human
and have a human response to other people,
that might be something the Turks are teaching computers
to do instead of you right now.
Like, what about like this, right?
Like what if right now some Turk is out there
training a computer to be a podcast host,
going like, how is the economy doing today?
The economy looked bad last week, is it doing better?
How do you feel about the economy?
Do you feel the economy is worse or better
than yesterday?
Exactly, like, okay, so that's what I'm saying.
Just sounding human, responding like a human,
that is a big part of our job.
And if someone can teach a computer to sound like us,
well, that's a problem for us.
Yeah, Mechanical Turk has been around for 10 years.
And when we were talking to Isaac Nichols,
the guy who helped us set up our task,
we asked him, what do you make of the system
that you created 10 years ago?
Is it too cutthroat a place?
Is it just too cheap?
The problem right now with Mechanical Turk
is it was designed with this sort of open-ended nature.
There were no rules and we didn't know,
you know, it was constructed in a way
to allow for people to experiment.
And now, you know, it's been a decade since it launched
and it's time for, you know,
some rules to be put into place.
What those rules are though, you know, I don't know.
The Turks have some ideas about what the rules should be.
And even though they were designed to be anonymous,
they found each other.
They talked to each other on forums,
they help each other navigate the system,
find shortcuts, figure out how to find the best hits.
They came up with this public review site,
TurkOpticon, to review people who post jobs for them.
Over Christmas, a bunch of Turks wrote
this big public letter to Jeff Bezos,
the head of Amazon.
And one thing that it said was, quote,
please stop selling us as nothing more than an algorithm
and instead introduce those who use your service
to the fact that we are living, breathing beings.
Before you ask me to go get a job today,
can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administer A's,
so I guess we just pray like the ministers say.
Now that our task has been done,
we can start tagging our episodes
with the names of the hosts for each show.
And you can thank Ashley for that.
And Matthew and Chris and Huang Zihong
and Manju and Hazel.
And Gina and William and Michael and Meg
and Cheryl and Ryan and Sindhu and Tanya.
David and Samantha and Brandi and Anita.
Grant, Xian Liu and Josh.
Thanks.
Thanks.
And special thanks today also to Ronik Chef
with Food Essentials, Reina Lunac with Amazon
and a bunch of other mechanical Turks
that we talked to online who helped us with this story.
Our show was produced by Thea Benin.
We'd love to hear what you thought of today's show.
You can email us, planetmoney at npr.org
or you can find us on Facebook or Twitter or Spotify.
And I just want to take a moment here
to seriously thank you guys for listening
because this is one of my last shows at Planet Money.
I'm moving on for a little while.
And so I need you to indulge me here for a second
because I love Planet Money so much.
And what I wanted to say is that
when I came to Planet Money, which was three years ago,
it had already started.
Like it had been a show I've been around
for three years and the table was all set.
The party was like going on.
There were all these dedicated listeners
and brilliant staff members
and everybody has just been so generous
and welcoming with me.
And so what happened was I proceeded
to learn pretty much everything that I know
about radio and economics
from the people here at Planet Money.
And I know that you guys know what that's like
because that's been your experience as well.
So thank you for listening, seriously.
And I love you guys.
We are all bummed to see Zoey go,
but I guarantee this will not be the last time
you hear her on Planet Money.
We are committed to having her back.
You know, we work closely with this American life,
but she will no longer be sitting right beside us,
which we are sad about.
All right, Zo, I'm Kaitlyn Kenney.
And I'm Zoey Chase.
Thanks for listening.
Thanks.
I heard them say,
nothing's ever promised tomorrow to day.
But we'll find a way.
Nothing lasts forever.
They say people in your life are seasons
and anything that happens is for a reason.
