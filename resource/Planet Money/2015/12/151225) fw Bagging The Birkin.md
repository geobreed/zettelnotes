There are people with Birkin bags and there are the rest of us. Today on the show: the elaborate, upside-down strategy that has kept a $60,000 purse the "it" bag for 30 years.

There are people with Birkin bags and then there are the rest of us. This purse, made by Hermes, the French luxury brand, averages $60,000. And it's been the "it" bag for 30 years.

The strange thing about Birkin bags: They always seem to be mysteriously out of stock. This is no accident. Today on the show, we go on a quest for a Birkin bag! And we find ourselves in a world where the normal rules of commerce are totally upside down.

VANEK SMITH: Hey, Sindhu.

SINDHU GNANASAMBANDAN, HOST:

Hey.

SMITH: So we're here finally.

I'm on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with Sindhu, our intern here at PLANET MONEY, and I'm about to set off on a kind of quest.

GNANASAMBANDAN: We're here. How do you feel?

SMITH: I feel like I'm going to throw up actually.

GNANASAMBANDAN: (Laughter) OK, well, don't throw up in the store, Stacey. I feel like that's bad tactic.

SMITH: Like all epic heroes, I have a plan.

I've been going over what I'm going to say. I think I'm ready.

GNANASAMBANDAN: What are you going to say?

SMITH: OK, I'm going to say - hey, do you have any Birkin bags?

The Birkin bag - it's a purse made by Hermes, the French luxury brand, and Birkins average around $60,000. You can get a starter Birkin for around 10,000. There are luxury goods and then there is the Birkin bag. For 30 years, the Birkin has been the it bag for rich and powerful women. Elizabeth Taylor carried one. Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian has one. Victoria Beckham apparently has, like, 100 of them.

This is the bag that proves you've made it, that you are on the top. There are people with Birkin bags and there are the rest of us. And apparently, even just getting to see one is kind of a big deal. They won't just show them to anyone. And this is why I'm so nervous. I am about to walk into an Hermes store, walk up to a salesperson and ask to see a Birkin bag, which is, like, my own personal nightmare. I find those stores really intimidating.

GNANASAMBANDAN: OK, you got this. Good luck.

SMITH: Thanks, man. I'll see you soon.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Bye. Oh, my God, I feel so bad for her.

Fourteen minutes later, Stacey finally emerged from the store.

Or - there she is. She's walking really fast.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Hey, you're back. How'd it go?

SMITH: Hi, Sindhu. OK.

GNANASAMBANDAN: (Laughter) Breathe. It's OK.

SMITH: It's OK. It's over. Yeah, so they didn't have any Birkins.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Surprise, surprise.

SMITH: This is the strange thing about Birkin bags. They always seem to be mysteriously out of stock. And this is no accident.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG)

UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Give it to me.

SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

GNANASAMBANDAN: And I'm Sindhu Gnanasambandan. Today on the show, the elaborate strategy that has kept the Birkin bag the large luxury it bag for decades.

SMITH: We go on a quest to see one of these bags and find ourselves in a world where the normal rules of commerce are totally upside down. Also, how you get someone to pay $60,000 for something that is, let's be honest, just a purse.

UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) Give it to me.

SMITH: Wednesday Martin - Wednesday's her first name - can remember the exact moment she started wanting a Birkin bag.

SMITH: It was right after she moved to the Upper East Side - it's one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in New York - and she was walking down the sidewalk, and she saw this very well-dressed woman walking towards her.

WEDNESDAY MARTIN: And we were the only people on the sidewalk, and as she walked toward me, rather than keeping to the right, she was slowly but surely walking, sort of, at me so that I had to move further and further to the right. And I was ceding more and more sidewalk territory to her until, finally, I found myself stopping right up against this garbage can that she had sort of walked me into, then she brushed right by me with her handbag. That was a dominance display, and that woman used her handbag to do it.

GNANASAMBANDAN: She's pretty sure it was a Birkin bag. They're a very simple, boxy handbag, kind of on the larger side, and they have a padlock on the clasp.

SMITH: And when this happened, Wednesday did not think - oh, my gosh, women in this neighborhood are crazy. I need to move. She thought - I need one of those bags.

MARTIN: That was the moment when I realized that handbags are really important in New York. And if I want to play ball on the Upper East Side, I better stop walking around with this white plastic bag with a couple of bananas in it. I better saddle up.

SMITH: Back in 1981, the CEO of Hermes was on a plane with the French actress Jane Birkin, and Jane complained she needed a weekend bag.

GNANASAMBANDAN: The Birkin bag was born.

SMITH: Wanting to buy a Birkin bag, that's the easy part. Even having the money isn't the really hard part. Finding one to buy? That is tricky, even for professionals. Michael Tonello ran into this. He had a business buying and selling luxury goods. And one day, one of his customers came in and said - hey, can you get me one of those Birkin bags?

MICHAEL TONELLO: I started asking for Birkin bags, but they quickly told me that they didn't have them. And I couldn't figure out why it was that Hermes didn't have any Birkin bags if it was, you know, a bag that Hermes made and sold.

SMITH: Michael started talking to other people who were trying to buy Birkins, and they were all being told the same thing. We are sold out. But we can put you on a waiting list.

TONELLO: Anywhere from two years to four years waiting list - at one point, they were saying that there was a waiting list to get on the waiting list. And it just all seemed kind of crazy to me.

GNANASAMBANDAN: If you got a bag that people are willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for, why won't you sell it to them?

SMITH: Hermes has an explanation. It says these bags take a really long time to make. They just can't keep up with demand. First of all, some of them are made out of these very exotic leathers, like a crocodile and ostrich. And Birkin bags are hand sewn by select artisans in the south of France. Hermes says that is why they are always sold out.

I ran this by Josh Weltman. He's worked in advertising for years. He was one of the producers of the show "Mad Men." They're, like, listen - these are totally handmade.

JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah.

SMITH: It takes 12 hours to make one. People have to apprentice for years in order to get to the level where they can make a Birkin bag. Like, this product is special.

WELTMAN: No.

SMITH: (Laughter).

WELTMAN: I'm sorry. It's not.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Josh says that if Hermes wanted to make more bags, they totally could. They've had 30 years to train those select artisans. He says the reason for the extreme scarcity of the Birkin bag has nothing to do with how it's made. It's part of the marketing.

SMITH: Josh says the whole idea of a luxury goods is something that not everyone has. And there are a couple of ways you can make sure that not everyone has your product. You can jack up the price. A lot of companies do this - fancy watch companies, luxury car companies - of course, the Birkin bag.

But Hermes has gone a step further. They don't just charge a lot for the Birkin bag. They make sure that not everyone can get one. They have made Birkin bags really hard to buy. And you have to go through all these weird rituals to get your hands on one.

GNANASAMBANDAN: But Wednesday Martin, our Upper East Sider, was determined to join the Birkin club. So she consulted an expert.

MARTIN: I conducted myself according to tribal code. And I went to a wise tribal elder, although she didn't look like an elder. She looked very young for her age.

SMITH: It was her friend's mom who owned a Birkin. Actually, she owned several Birkins. And her friend's mom called the salesperson she knew at Hermes and, quote, "effected an introduction."

She told Wednesday to send her husband to the Hermes store to introduce himself to the salesperson. Apparently, Wednesday would have a better shot at a Birkin if her husband said he wanted to buy it for her as a gift.

MARTIN: He had to show up in person and meet this lovely saleswoman who said, I hope you'll understand there - we'll have to wait.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Even Wednesday - from the right neighborhood, with the right connections, doing everything right - even she couldn't get a bag.

SMITH: And this goes beyond scarcity. Where most stores try to make you feel welcome, try to make you feel special, Hermes's strategy seems to be to reject and humiliate. Josh Weltman, the advertiser, says that is intentional.

WELTMAN: They play hard to get. That's how they seduce you.

SMITH: It almost sounds like they're kind of, like, humiliating...

WELTMAN: They haze you. It's a hazing process.

SMITH: Hazing doesn't, like, create resentment?

WELTMAN: No, it creates a bond once you're in. It makes you feel that you're worthy. It gives you identity.

SMITH: I mean, think about this. Hermes has created a $60,000 purse, and instead of convincing you why on earth you should pay that crazy amount for a Birkin bag, Hermes has people trying to convince them to let them buy one. Like, please let me spend $60,000 at your store.

GNANASAMBANDAN: And this may just sound like this insane marketing tactic used on insane people who have way too much money, but Josh says that you can actually find this tactic everywhere.

SMITH: The basic example is night clubs, like when they have that big line out front. And Josh says elite colleges do the same thing.

WELTMAN: The thing that they published about Harvard and Stanford and all the Ivy Leagues is the ratio of how many people they let in compared to the amount of people that they reject. It's not a high status school unless it's super selective.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Everyone wants to be a part of a club that's just out of reach.

WELTMAN: That's the soft part (laughter) that we're poking at in advertising, you know.

SMITH: It feels a little sinister that they're, like, marketing right to our soft spot. It's like we're helpless.

WELTMAN: Well, they didn't put the soft spot there, you know. You're the one that has the itch, you know.

SMITH: But...

WELTMAN: They're just letting you scratch it, right? I mean, that's a service.

SMITH: Wow. You're good at your job.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: There is, of course, a very obvious cost to this strategy of turning people away, to poking at that soft spot. For Hermes, it means that every time someone walks into a store and asks to buy a Birkin bag and they say no, that is a $60,000 sale they are not making.

WELTMAN: They don't get greedy. I guess that's what I'm - (laughter) sort of a weird thing to say about a company that's charging $70,000 for a bag.

SMITH: And not getting greedy pays off. Josh says the reason that the Birkin has been on the top of the handbag food chain for 30 years is exactly because it's so hard to get. It keeps people wanting one. Of course, to make money, Hermes does eventually have to sell a bag to someone.

GNANASAMBANDAN: Wednesday Martin did actually finally get one in this totally random way. Her husband was on this business trip in Japan, and he saw an Hermes store, so he went and asked - do you have a Birkin bag? They said no, sorry, we're out. He said I need one. They said no, we're out. And he said no - I need one.

MARTIN: And Japan is an extremely polite (laughter) culture. I think that after they told him a few times that they couldn't do that and he insisted a few times that, in fact, they could and he wanted them to, they must've just thought - this man is so rude (laughter). And this is so awkward. The best way to get him out of here might be to just let him buy one of these. So (laughter) they produced a bag.

SMITH: And remember our luxury buyer, Michael Tonello? He also ended up getting a Birkin bag in a totally different way. He was in an Hermes store buying a bunch of scarves for a customer.

TONELLO: And I piled up about 10 or 15 Hermes scarves, and as we were walking to the register to pay, just sort of nonchalantly, like, I mean, literally, it was an afterthought, I said to the salesperson - oh, you know, do you happen to have a Birkin bag? And the salesperson said oh, I don't know. Let me look in the back.

SMITH: What did you think?

TONELLO: I thought, she's going to go in the back room and come out tell me they don't have any Birkin bags.

SMITH: Instead, she came out with a big orange box - a Birkin bag. And she let him buy it for $20,000.

GNANASAMBANDAN: So then Michael goes across town to another Hermes store and tries the same thing. It totally works.

SMITH: Michael had accidentally cracked the code -buying a bunch of really expensive stuff at the Hermes store first then casually ask for a bag, and you'll get one.

TONELLO: I suddenly realized that it was a lot like chemistry class. The order in which you put the chemicals into the beaker are very, very important.

SMITH: Somehow, Michael had turned the Hermes shopping experience back into a normal commerce situation.

I have a pet theory about this. I think that after he bought all those thousands of dollars' worth of scarves, the salespeople at Hermes felt grateful to him. They felt like they owed him, and they wanted to be nice to him, like in a normal store. And that is the moment when Michael asked for the Birkin bag. He caught them at a weak moment.

GNANASAMBANDAN: But Stacey and I, we still hadn't seen a Birkin though. So when we met Wednesday, we asked if we could see hers.

SMITH: Do you mind it - can we see your bag?

So I've actually never seen one. I mean, I'm sure I've seen them around, but...

And this felt kind of momentous. That is the genius of Hermes. Even just seeing a Birkin bag feels like a big deal.

It's very, like, clean lines, very simple, very under - very plain, really.

MARTIN: It's very plain and simple and understated.

SMITH: I mean, if I just saw this on the street, and I didn't know what a special bag it was, I wouldn't, like, look at it twice.

MARTIN: You might just say - who cares? That's not such a great looking bag.

SMITH: OK, so here's the truth. That bag is so underwhelming. It is, like, aggressively underwhelming. It's ugly and boxy, and the leather doesn't even seem that nice. But as I was looking at it, I caught myself trying to see how special it was. I kept thinking, people pay $60,000 for this bag. This is a special bag. If I can't see that, I have the problem.

Can I touch it?

MARTIN: Yeah, touch it.

SMITH: I feel like it's almost like a religious - I feel like - I don't - there really is some weird aura about it.

This is really embarrassing to listen to right now - religious relic, aura - that's - (laughter) what happened to me? I was reporting a story about bags. But it's hard not to get sucked in, even when you know all the mechanisms behind what's going on. And Wednesday Martin said she knew how I felt.

Did you ever feel, like, a little suckered by Hermes, going through all of this?

MARTIN: Are you kidding? Of course, only every single second that I was doing it. I thought, I have lost it. I felt ridiculous about it all the time, and I still do (laughter). I still hope to come out of this interview sounding like a person with a sense of humor rather than a zombie. But in a sense, I did become a zombie.

SMITH: Still, Wednesday says, having a Birkin bag really did help her feel more at home on the Upper East Side. She never got pushed off a sidewalk again. People who didn't have Birkins approached her to ask her how she'd gotten it, to ask if they could hold it. People who did have Birkins wanted to exchange war stories. She said the bag helped her feel like she had a place in this new neighborhood.

For Sindhu and I, our quest was done. We had seen a real-life Birkin bag. We had touched it, and we decided to celebrate, we would retreat to our own world of luxury.

In this part of town, we can probably only afford a coffee. Do you, like, want to go get a coffee?

GNANASAMBANDAN: Let's get some $6 coffee.

(LAUGHTER)

GNANASAMBANDAN: It really does taste better.

SMITH: We always love to hear what you think of the show. Shoot us an email - planetmoney@npr.org, or you can tweet us - @planetmoney. You can tell us what your own personal Birkin quest was for.

**faster whisper:**
Hey, Sindhu. Hey. So we're here, finally. I'm on the Upper East Side of Manhattan
with Sindhu, our intern here at Planet Money, and I'm about to set off on a
kind of quest. We're here. How do you feel? I feel like I'm gonna throw up,
actually. Okay, well don't throw up in the store, Stacy. I feel like that
is a bad tactic. Like all epic heroes, I have a plan. I've been going
over what I'm gonna say. I think I'm ready. What are you gonna say? Okay, I'm
gonna say, um, hey, do you have any Birkin bags? The Birkin bag. It's a purse made by
Hermes, the French luxury brand, and Birkins average around $60,000. You can
get a starter Birkin for around $10,000. There are luxury goods and

stores really intimidating. Okay, you got this. Good luck. Thanks, man. I'll
see you soon. Bye. Oh my god, I feel so bad for her. 14 minutes later,
Stacey finally emerged from the store or there she is. So I can really
fast. Hey, you're back. How'd it go? Okay. Breathe. It's okay. Okay, it's
over. Yeah. So they didn't have any Birkins. Surprise, surprise. This is
the strange thing about Birkin bags. They always seem to be mysteriously
out of stock. And this is no accident.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. And I'm Sindhu

of these bags and find ourselves in a world where the normal rules of

She's pretty sure it was a Birkin bag. They're a very simple boxy

the clasp. And when this happened, Wednesday did not think, oh
my gosh, women in this neighborhood are crazy, I need to

I started asking for Birkin bags. But they quickly told me
that they didn't have them. And I couldn't figure out why it

know, a bag that Hermes made and sold.
Michael started talking to other people who were trying to
buy Birkins, and they were all being told the same thing. We
are sold out. But we can put you on a waiting list.
Anywhere from two years to four years waiting list. At
one point, they were saying that there was a waiting list
to get on the waiting list. And it just all seemed kind
of crazy to me.
If you got a bag that people are willing to pay tens of
thousands of dollars for, why won't you sell it to them?
Hermes has an explanation. It says these bags take a really
long time to make. They just can't keep up with demand.

They don't just charge a lot for the Birkin bag.
They make sure that not everybody can get one.
They have made Birkin bags really hard to buy.
And you have to go through all these weird rituals to get
your hands on one. But Wednesday Martin, our Upper
East Sider, was determined to join the Birkin Club.
So she consulted an expert.
I conducted myself according to tribal code.
And I went to a wise tribal elder, although
she didn't look like an elder, she looked very
young for her age. It was her friend's mom who
owned a Birkin. Actually, she owned several
Birkins. And her friend's mom called a salesperson
she knew at Hermes and, quote, affected in
introduction. She told Wednesday to send her
husband to the Hermes store to introduce himself
to the salesperson.
Apparently, Wednesday would have a better shot at
a Birkin if her husband said he wanted to buy it
for her as a gift.
He had to show up in person and meet this
lovely saleswoman who said, I hope you'll
understand that we'll have to wait.
Even Wednesday, from the right neighborhood with
the right connections, doing everything right,
even she couldn't get a bag.
And this goes beyond scarcity, where most stores
try to make you feel welcome, try to make you
feel special. Hermes's strategy seems to be to
reject and humiliate.
Josh Weltman, the advertiser, says that is
intentional. They play hard to get.
That's how they seduce you.
It almost sounds like they're kind of like
humiliating. They haze you.
It's a hazing process.
Hazing doesn't like create resentment.
No, it creates a bond.
Once you're in, it makes you feel that you're
worthy. It gives you identity.
I mean, think about this.
Hermes has created a sixty thousand dollar
purse. And instead of convincing you why on
earth you should pay that crazy amount for a
Birkin bag, Hermes has people trying to
convince them to let them buy one.
Like, please let me spend sixty thousand
dollars at your store.
And this may just sound like this insane
marketing tactic used on insane people who
have way too much money.
But Josh says that you can actually find this
tactic everywhere.
The basic example is nightclubs, like when
they have that big line out front.
And Josh says elite colleges do the same
thing. The thing that they publish about
Harvard and Stanford and all the Ivy
leagues is the ratio of how many people
they let in compared to the amount of
people that they reject.
It's not a high status school unless
it's super selective.
Everyone wants to be part of a club.
That's just out of reach.
That's the soft part that we're poking
at in advertising, you know.
It feels a little sinister that they're
like marketing right to our soft spot.
It's like we're helpless.
Well, they didn't put the soft spot
there. You know, you're the one that has
the itch, you know.
But.
They're just letting you scratch it.
Right. I mean, that's a service.
Wow.
You're good at your job.
There is, of course, a very obvious cost
to the strategy of turning people away
to poking at that soft spot.
For Hermes, it means that every time
someone walks into a store and asked
to buy a Birkin bag and they say no,
that is a sixty thousand dollar sale
they are not making.
They don't get greedy.
I guess that's what I'm sort of a
weird thing to say about a company
that's charging seventy thousand
dollars for a bag and not getting
greedy pays off.
Josh, is the reason that the Birkin
has been on the top of the handbag
food chain for 30 years
is exactly because it's so
hard to get.
It keeps people wanting one.
Of course, to make money, Hermes
does eventually have to sell a bag
to someone.
Wednesday, Martin did actually
finally get one in this totally
random way.
Her husband was on this business
trip in Japan and he's on Hermes
store. So he went in and asked, do
you have a Birkin bag?
They said, no, sorry, we're out.
He said, I need one.
They said, no, we're out.
And he said, no, I need
one.
And Japan is an extremely polite
culture.
I think that after they told
him a few times that they
couldn't do that and he insisted
a few times that in fact
they could and he wanted them to.
They must have just thought,
this man is so rude and this
is so awkward.
The best way to get him out of here
might be to just let him
buy one of these.
So they produced a bag.
And remember our luxury buyer,
Michael Tonello?
He also ended up getting a Birkin
bag in a totally different way.
He was in an Hermes store
buying a bunch of scarves for a
customer.
And I piled up about 10 or 15
Hermes scarves.
And as we were walking to the
register to pay,
just sort of nonchalantly like,
I mean, literally it was an
afterthought.
I said to the salesperson,
oh, you know, do you happen to
have a Birkin bag?
And the salesperson said, oh, I
don't know. Let me look in the
back.
What did you think?
I thought she's going to go in
the back room and come out and
tell me they don't have any
Birkin bags.
Instead, she came out with a
big orange box,
a Birkin bag.
And she let him buy it
for twenty thousand dollars.
So then Michael goes across town
to another Hermes store and tries
the same thing.
It totally works.
Michael had accidentally cracked
the code, buying a bunch of
really expensive stuff at their
Hermes store first, then
casually ask for a bag
and you'll get one.
I suddenly realized that it was
a lot like chemistry class.
The order in which you put
the chemicals into the
beaker are very,
very important.
Somehow, Michael had turned the
Hermes shopping experience back
into a normal commerce
situation.
I have a pet theory about
this. I think that after he
bought all those thousands of
dollars worth of scarves, the
salespeople at Hermes felt
grateful to him.
They felt like they owed him and
they wanted to be nice to him,
like in a normal store.
And that is the moment when
Michael asked for the Birkin
bag. He caught them at a weak
moment.
But Stacey and I, we still
hadn't seen a Birkin,
though. So when we met
Wednesday, we asked if we
could see hers.
Do you mind if we see your
bag? So I've actually never
seen one.
I mean, I'm sure I've seen
them around.
And this felt kind of
momentous.
That is the genius of Hermes,
even just seeing a Birkin bag
feels like a big deal.
It's very like clean lines,
very simple, very,
very under, very plain,
really.
It's very plain
and simple and understated.
I mean, if I just saw this on
the street and I didn't know
what a special bag it was, I
wouldn't like look at it
twice.
You might just say, who cares?
That's not such a great
looking bag.
OK, so here's the truth.
That bag is so
underwhelming.
It is like aggressively
underwhelming.
It's ugly and boxy.
And the leather doesn't even
seem that nice.
But as I was looking at it,
I caught myself trying
to see how special it was.
I kept thinking people pay
sixty thousand dollars
for this bag.
This is a special bag.
If I can't see that,
I have the problem.
Can I touch it?
Yeah, touch it.
I feel I feel like it's
almost like a religious.
I feel like I don't know.
There really is some weird
aura about it.
This is really embarrassing
to listen to right now.
Religious relic aura.
That's what happened to me.
I was reporting a story
about bags, but it's hard
not to get sucked in,
even when you know
all the mechanisms
behind what's going on.
And Wednesday, Martin
said she knew how I felt.
Did you ever feel like
a little suckered
by Hermes
going through all this?
Are you kidding?
Of course.
Only every single second
that I was doing it,
I thought I have lost it.
I felt ridiculous
about it all the time.
And I still do.
I still hope
to come out of this interview
sounding like a person
with a sense of humor
rather than a zombie.
But in a sense,
I did become a zombie.
Still, Wednesday says
having a Birkin bag
really did help her
feel more at home
on the Upper East Side.
She never got pushed
off a sidewalk again.
People who didn't have
Birkins approached her
to ask her how she'd gotten it,
to ask if they could hold it.
People who did have Birkins
wanted to exchange war stories.
She said the bag helped her
feel like she had a place
in this new neighborhood.
For Sindhu and I,
our quest was done.
We had seen a real live Birkin bag.
We had touched it.
And we decided to celebrate.
We would retreat
to our own world of luxury.
In this part of town,
we can probably only
afford a coffee.
Do you want to go get a coffee?
Let's get some six dollar coffee.
It really does taste better.
