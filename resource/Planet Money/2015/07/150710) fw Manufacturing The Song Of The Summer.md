The story of the secret battle to create the song of the summer — the music industry's holy grail.

There's a secret battle every year. The battle is over creating the song of the summer, the music industry's holy grail.

It starts long before the song hits the airwaves with "writing camp" — a pop-up version of the old hit factories that produced pop songs.

Writing camp is expensive. But the real money doesn't start flowing until after the song is done.

Note: Today's show originally aired in July 2011.

Music: BOPD's "Ain't No Thing," Rihanna's "Umbrella," The Black Eyed Peas's "I Gotta Feeling," Katy Perry's "California Gurls," R. Kelly's "If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time," Jennifer Lopez's "I'm Real," and Fetty Wap's "Trap Queen." Find us: Twitter/ Facebook/ Spotify/ Tumblr.

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

It's the middle of July, and on the music charts right now, the competition for song of the summer is in full effect. What we're going to tell you about on this podcast is the secret battle that has been going on for most of the last year to create that song. It's the holy grail of the record industry. You know what I'm talking about. It's the song that's blasting out of every car with the windows down when the car is stopped, like - remember 2007, it was this song.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "UMBRELLA")

RIHANNA: (Singing) Now that it's raining more than ever, know that we'll still have each other. You can stand under my umbrella. You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella, eh, eh, eh, under my umbrella-ella-ella, eh, eh, eh, under my umbrella.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

How could I forget "Umbrella"?

CHACE: This is one of my favorite songs of all time.

SMITH: I love it, too. And then, of course, the song that everybody heard - that even my kids could sing was this one - 2009.

CHACE: Black Eyed Peas.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOTTA FEELING")

BLACK EYED PEAS: (Singing) That tonight's gonna be a good night. that tonight's gonna be a good night, that tonight's gonna be a good, good night. Tonight's the night. Let's live it up. I got my money. Let's spend it up.

CHACE: You know, they really ground you down with that song. It was impossible not to like it by the end of the summer, 2009.

SMITH: I confess. I do like it. And then the next year there was, of course, this classic song of the summer.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CALIFORNIA GURLS")

KATY PERRY: (Singing) California girls, we're undeniable, fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. West Coast represent, now put your hands up, oh, oh, oh.

CHACE: Katy Perry, "California Gurls." You know the song. Don't pretend like you don't know it because you do.

SMITH: I know the song.

CHACE: Well, good.

SMITH: Listen, I'm just picturing PLANET MONEY listeners on the way to the beach. They put the top down on the car, cranking up their economics podcast.

CHACE: That's exactly the point of the song of the summer, OK. So the field of battle for the song of the summer is strewn with casualties - songs that just didn't quite have the stifling ubiquity that means it's a hit like the Black Eyes Peas.

(SOUNDBITE OF BOPD SONG, "AIN'T NO THING")

CHACE: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Zoe Chace.

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Today we air one of our favorite podcasts we've ever done. It is about the song of the summer. It originally aired in 2011, and it's about how much money does it actually cost to make a song and how much does it cost to make it a hit.

CHACE: OK, on to the podcast. We're going to walk you through how much it costs to build one of these summer's contenders and we're going to use Rihanna's latest single, "Man Down."

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MAN DOWN")

RIHANNA: (Singing) Man down. Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum.

SMITH: This song has Rihanna's name on it, and, of course, it has that little Caribbean lilt to it, but dozens of people and lots of money went into making it and hopefully making it a hit. Now, Zoe, you have been dissecting this song for weeks now. I've heard it playing out of your cubicle over and over again through the day. And you're going to walk us through, step-by-step, how much it costs to make the song, and then our listeners can decide if it was worth it in the end.

CHACE: OK, so let's start. It might not surprise you to know the making of the song doesn't actually begin with Rihanna herself.

SMITH: Shocker.

CHACE: Right. Rihanna gets a bad rap on that, but it's not like Frank Sinatra wrote "Lady Is A Tramp," you know what I mean.

SMITH: Fair enough.

CHACE: This is not a new thing for pop music. Like, songs used to be manufactured in a building. It was called a hit factory like the Motown building in Detroit and the Brill Building in New York. And pop songs are still made in a factory, but it's a temporary factory. And these days, you call it a writing camp. And at a writing camp, a record label hires the best producers and music writers in the country, flies them all into the same city and drops them into the nicest recording studios in that city for, like, two weeks. And I talked to someone who was there when "Man Down" was written.

RAY DANIELS: It was like, you know, an all-star game. You get everybody in - we're going to have the best of the best and we're going to make the best records.

CHACE: That's Ray Daniels. He's manager of a songwriting team called Rock City. Rock City was invited to the Rihanna writing camp in LA. This was March of 2010. And that brings us to the first cost of a hit song, which is the cost of renting all those studios that make up a writing camp.

DANIELS: Let's say we got 10 rooms working. Every day, them rooms are costing anywhere between $2,000 and $2,500 per day, per room. You got 10 rooms going - that's $25,000 per day.

SMITH: OK, OK. I'm going to actually keep the tally here so we know where we're at - $25,000 and that's not including, like, you know, the masseuse and the nice dinner they go out to, right. So $25,000 a day, and what are they doing this whole time?

CHACE: OK, let's take the room where "Man Down" was created. It's a recording studio - two brothers, Timothy and Theron Thomas.

SMITH: They're the songwriters.

CHACE: They are the songwriters. And they are matched up with a producer, which is this guy Sham Joseph. The songwriters brought an idea for the song to the writing camp. They were sort of thinking about it - they knew it was Rihanna, she's from Barbados - and they were thinking let's do this female response to Bob Marley's "I Shot The Sheriff," right, which is a good idea. And the producer, Sham Joseph, would come to the writing camp just with his laptop with a bunch of beats - a bunch of music - on the laptop. No words.

SMITH: So there's no musicians involved at this point.

CHACE: No, no instruments, OK, nobody would play instruments - no instruments. So the songwriters and the producer's in the studio. Sham opens up his laptop, he plays the track, no lyrics at this point.

(SOUNDBITE OF RIHANNA SONG, "MAN DOWN")

CHACE: The songwriters are listening to the track.

DANIELS: They'll go into the booth, and they'll hum the record. They'll just say a melody. (Humming).

CHACE: And they start to come up with this little melody, you know, the part over the top of the music that you'll actually sing along to.

SMITH: As they're standing there, they're listening to this, they're going, man down.

CHACE: Yeah, exactly. It happens very, very quickly. Just listen to the demo that was created. You can actually hear one of the writers singing the songs.

(SOUNDBITE OF DEMO, "MAN DOWN")

UNIDENTIFIED SONGWRITER: (Singing) Oh and I took his heart when I pulled out that gun. Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum. Man down. Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum. Man down.

CHACE: They already had the concept, remember, so when they put the lyrics down on paper and record it, it all happens pretty quickly.

DANIELS: They literally wrote "Man Down" in about 12, 13 minutes.

SMITH: (Laughter) Twelve - I love that, like, the whole creative process of a song takes place in the period of time it would take me to go get a cup of coffee at Starbucks.

CHACE: Yes, it's actually really hard to do that - to come up with these lyrics. So - and the other thing is they're not just writing one song. They have to come up with dozens and dozens of these songs because at the end of the two weeks, Rihanna's going to come in, listen to all the demos and pick her favorites for the album. Her record label, Def Jam, foots the bill for this entire process.

DANIELS: It had to cost at least $200,000. I mean, it was at least 40 guys out there, like, I was shocked how much money they were spending.

CHACE: Wow.

DANIELS: But guess what, they got the whole album out of that one camp.

SMITH: OK, so they write the whole album in that couple of weeks. And I'm just going to crunch the numbers here so we can keep track. The camp costs around $200,000, right? And there are 11 tracks on the new Rihanna album, so that's 11 potential hit singles, if she's great. And so you divide 200,000 by 11, and you get, I don't know, around $18,000. So for our example of "Man Down," we can say that the expense of writing this song cost $18,000.

CHACE: No, no, no, no, no, no. That's just for the overhead - the rooms and the dinners. The songwriter and the producer each get a fee for their service after the song was picked. So it's $15,000 to the writer and $20,000 to the person who did the music.

SMITH: OK, OK, 18, 15, 20 - I'm adding this up and the total is $53,000 spent so far on "Man Down." But at this point, like, there's no actual Rihanna on it (laughter).

CHACE: (Laughter) Right, that's the money laid out before Rihanna even steps into the studio. And when Rihanna steps into the studio, she brings her vocal producer, and the vocal producer tells Rihanna how to sing the song.

MAKEBA RIDDICK: I need you to belt this out. I need you to scream this as if you're on one end of the block and you're trying to talk to somebody three blocks away.

CHACE: That's Rihanna's vocal producer, Makeba Riddick. And she didn't actually do "Man Down," but she's coached Rihanna so many times through voicing chart-topping singles that I just called her up and asked her how much she costs.

RIDDICK: It can start anywhere between $10,000 to $15,000 to go in and do a song.

CHACE: And it sounds expensive, but picture the working conditions, OK. Makeba Riddick explained to me, it's not just Rihanna in the booth and the vocal producer in the control room. In the studio, it's like a party is going on. There's 30 to 40 people there, you know, the artist's entourage and people's phones are going off, and they're ordering in food. It's like a mini music video or something.

RIDDICK: They'll have, you know, strobe lights, you know. They'll have incense burning. They'll have smoke machines, and they'll have doves.

CHACE: (Laughter) Have you really ever seen that?

RIDDICK: Yes, I have.

SMITH: Doves, like the birds?

CHACE: Doves.

SMITH: Like a Prince video or a John Woo film - slow-motion doves flying to help you sing.

CHACE: Yeah.

SMITH: (Laughter) OK.

CHACE: Doves actually help me track the podcast so.

SMITH: You're demanding that one.

CHACE: Yeah. Doves. But the thing is the job of the vocal producer is to get the song done. And the label president could, and often will, just show up at five in the morning like where's Rihanna's vocals? You know, are you done? And Rihanna doesn't need doves flying around the studio. Riddick says Rihanna is very focused. And she wouldn't tell me exactly what Rihanna needs to get in the mood.

SMITH: OK. So for the tally, we will not count the bird wrangler. I'm just going to write down $15,000, and that's for the vocal coaching to focus you while the party rages around you.

CHACE: Right. Then the song gets mixed, you know, the vocal and the music put together. Then the song is mastered at an entirely different studio. And altogether, that adds another $10,000 or so.

SMITH: $10,000, got it.

CHACE: It's a lot of money to make a superstar's record. But only superstars get that treatment.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MAN DOWN")

RIHANNA: (Singing) Oh, Mama, Mama, Mama, I just shot a man down in central station in front of a big ol' crowd.

SMITH: All right, mathematics time. We have the cost of the writing camp, the songwriter, the producer, the vocal coach, the room rental, whatever birds are involved, an engineer mixing - my total here is $78,000 so far. And we have a finished song, right?

CHACE: OK. You do have a song, but nobody's heard that song yet. So you don't have a hit song, right; $78,000 is pennies compared to what comes next to make it a hit. Here's manager Ray Daniels.

DANIELS: A rollout of one record might cost a million dollars.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "S&M")

RIHANNA: (Singing) Na, na, na come on.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Rihanna's here. Hey, Rihanna.

DANIELS: The reason why it costs so much is because you need everybody to move at once. You want them to turn on the radio and hear Rihanna...

(SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED RADIO SHOW)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Rihanna's live in studio 3 now.

DANIELS: ...To turn on BET and see Rihanna.

(SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED BET SHOW)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: ...You're reactions to be Rihanna's latest video, "Man Down."

(APPLAUSE)

DANIELS: When you look on Billboard, you look on the iTunes chart...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Oh, my God. "Loud" is number one on iTunes right now.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #4: What?

DANIELS: I need to pay to make sure the record is on iTunes. When you log on to Apple Store, I want you to see Rihanna first. All of that costs. I need everything to click at once. That's what the money comes from.

SMITH: And he said a million dollars at the top, a million dollars. But, you know, before I add that to this tally - I mean, that seems like a lot of money just to roll out a record. What does it take? What do they do with that?

CHACE: OK, so to get the song into everybody's ears, you know, you need marketing. So you need billboards, commercials, banner ads on iTunes. You have to move the artist all around the country to different radio stations, to do interviews and promote the record. And you're paying for radio play.

SMITH: Payola.

CHACE: Payola. Call it what you want. In order to have a hit song, it has to be on the radio. It costs money to get a song on blast on every radio station at the same time. I'm going to give you an example of how it works, how far the record labels will go to make a hit. This song is from 2001.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I'M REAL")

JA RULE: (Singing) ...The way you talk.

JENNIFER LOPEZ: (Singing) 'Cause I'm real.

JA RULE: (Singing) The way you stare, the way you look, the style yo' hair.

LOPEZ: (Singing) 'Cause I'm real.

JA RULE: (Singing) The way you smile, the way you smell that drives me wild.

LOPEZ: (Singing) 'Cause I'm real.

JA RULE AND JENNIFER LOPEZ: (Singing) And I can't go on without you.

SMITH: Of course that's Jennifer Lopez, and, I mean, listen, that is a good song. I remember this song.

CHACE: It's a great song.

SMITH: It's got a good hook. I remember hearing it on the radio.

CHACE: Right. Well, one of the reasons that you know that song, one of the reasons that you heard it on the radio is because the record label bribed DJs to play it. And we know this from court cases, and I saw that in order to get that song played on the radio in Buffalo, the record label paid the radio programmers $939. I saw this in the court documents.

SMITH: That's very precise - $939 gets you airplay in Buffalo. And that's just Buffalo. I mean, imagine what it costs to get J. Lo in New York or on, you know, an LA station across the country.

CHACE: So I talked to somebody who was a programmer back then in the early 2000s. And his name is Paul Porter. And these days he runs a media watchdog group called Industry Ears. But he used to be a video programmer for BET. And he explains it like this. The labels didn't pay, you know, for one record. They would pay for a relationship with the station. The song request would come way later.

PAUL PORTER: You don't get bought on certain records. You get paid first, and then people come back and ask you favors. So here's for example. I go to New York for a weekend. I take the Excella (ph) up. I stay at the Soho grand. It's a beautiful, luxurious, all-glass room. I get tickets to see the Knicks. I go over to somebody's house, pick up an envelope that has $5,000 in it. I have a great weekend. I go back, and I don't hear from the person for weeks. Then I hear about an R. Kelly video.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "IF I COULD TURN BACK THE HANDS OF TIME")

R. KELLY: (Singing) Oh, if I could turn...

PORTER: It's a 10-minute video. And it was like a pop country song. It was not a BET thing.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "IF I COULD TURN BACK THE HANDS OF TIME")

R. KELLY: (Singing) And, my darling, you, you would be mine.

PORTER: And the song - some people liked it, but it's 10 minutes of R. Kelly, and it sucked to me. But the guy had been so nice. I had a great weekend. He never ever asked me anything. And he said, Paul, look, I just need to get this played a couple of times. That's all he asked for; not major rotation. It was 10 minutes, and I played it.

SMITH: Now, I know you have these stories of this happening in the past. Everyone is very careful to say, oh, this is how it used to be. But is it happening today? I mean, if "Man Down" is going to get played on the radio, and we already said it could take a million dollars to do it, is any of that money actually going toward Payola?

CHACE: Well, this is where it gets complicated. It's fuzzy, OK. Five years ago, everything changed in the relationship between the record companies and the radio stations because Eliot Spitzer, before the scandal and before he was governor of New York, he was New York's attorney general, and he was a big anticorruption guy. So in 2006, he launched this big investigation into Payola practices, and he uncovered a lot. That's how I got the information about J. Lo. And he got all the major labels and all the major programmers to admit that bribes for song play had been rampant through the '90s and into the 2000s, and they all paid huge fines and set up new compliance standards.

SMITH: But, you know, you just told me that the record labels still have these huge budgets for radio. If they're not using it for outright Payola, for bribery, then what are they spending the money on?

CHACE: Well, it's a little unclear.

SMITH: (Laughter).

CHACE: Right. Paul Porter, the former programmer who played that R. Kelly song, claims that FedEx trucks are still showing up on Saturday mornings with envelopes full of $100 bills, but he didn't give me any evidence of outright Payola that's happening right now. And Ray Daniels, you know, our industry insider that we spoke to in the beginning - I asked him about this, too, of course. And he says since Spitzer, it's not so overt. He would characterize it more as a nice date versus prostitution.

DANIELS: Radio, you're talking about treating the radio guys nice and telling them start it off in the mix show. I need 75 spins a week. No, I need this station to play this record 100 times a week. You want me to play your music? Treat me good. It's like if you want something from a girl. What you want? What you want, get it girl. When you want her to be yours, what you got to do? You got to treat her nice. Take her on the restaurants that are expensive, buy her expensive gifts. You got to treat her nice. That don't mean you're paying for her. That means you're paying to show her that you're serious about her. I'm not going to call it Payola, but I will say that.

SMITH: There's something I just do not understand about this that seems so weird to me, which is why is this Payola even illegal in the first place? Why is it unethical to pay some money to advertise your album, basically, by putting a song on the air? You know, I think about grocery stores, and cereal companies pay grocery stores a stocking fee so that they get good placement in the grocery store. I think about movies where companies will pay the movie producers money in order to put their products in their product placement. All of this seems perfectly normal, but when it comes to radio stations, all of a sudden, everybody's like, oh, no, it's illegal. You can't pay money to put a song on the radio.

CHACE: I mean, that's a good point, but the argument is that radio is different. Eliot Spitzer, when he did his investigation, he said that pay-for-play is deception. So, you know when a radio DJ says we're playing the best music of the '80s, '90s and today?

SMITH: Yeah. Our number one song today is...

CHACE: Yeah, is that the best music, you know? If those songs are just paid for, then that's kind of a lie. And Spitzer argued that it's fraud. Furthermore, the radio waves are officially public property. They are regulated by the FCC. And radio stations just rent the frequency. It's regulated by the government. Taking money to promote a song is not considered, legally, to be in the public interest. So if you do pay for a song to be on the radio, you're supposed to disclose it like, say, this song by Lady Gaga was just aired because of money donated to my sell-a-ticket from Interscope.

SMITH: (Laughter).

CHACE: Or, you know, something to that effect.

SMITH: I still think it's ridiculous 'cause, you know, these same radio stations play songs called jingles. They play the (singing) 1-800-M-A-T - the 1-800-MATTRESS jingle. And they get paid for playing that song, but, oh, no, no, you all of a sudden play "Man Down," take a little money, that's all of a sudden wrong? That seems kind of arbitrary.

CHACE: Well, the other argument is actually whether Payola even works because a radio station is not going to put a lousy song into heavy rotation just because they're paid a lot of money to do it because they'll lose all their listeners if they do that. Their listeners will change the station. And so radio stations are constantly testing this out. And they have market research groups testing Rihanna songs and seeing which one's have the potential to be big hits.

SMITH: Speaking of big hits, let's see if Rihanna made it. Mr. DJ, Jess Jiang, turn the music up.

CHACE: Turn the music up.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MAN DOWN")

RIHANNA: (Singing) ...Man down, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum. Man down. Oh, Mama, Mama, Mama, I just shot a man down.

SMITH: All right, it is time to total up the bill for Rihanna's "Man Down."

CHACE: Yes.

SMITH: We got the writing camp, the songwriters, the producers and the mixers. That's $78,000. And we add in the radio - however they get the money to them - the tour and the marketing; and the grand total to create and market "Man Down" by Rihanna is $1,078,000.

CHACE: Oh, and the video drop.

DANIELS: Oh, yeah. You forgot the video. We're not even talking about the fact that the video costs like $100,000 to $150,000. We - this is money. Like, we're talking about money just to - and for something that might not work.

SMITH: All right, a $1.25 million with the video. And the final question I guess is what did they get for their investment? I mean, how's "Man Down" doing?

CHACE: Well.

SMITH: (Laughter). Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? After all this work, after this whole podcast.

CHACE: To be honest - basically - let me put it like this - I've been playing it more at PLANET MONEY than it's been playing in the entire country this week. (Laughter) I mean, it hasn't sold that well. Radio play has been minimal. But, you know, that's how it goes with the song of the summer.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TRAP QUEEN")

FETTY WAP: (Rapping) ...To me, boy...

SMITH: It's been a few years since we originally aired this podcast, and so I think we can, at this point, definitively say that Rihanna's "Man Down" did not become the song of the summer that year. She ran headlong into a woman named Adele with a song you probably heard of, "Rolling In The Deep." I called up Zoe, and I said, hey, it's 2015, what is the song of this summer? Go. And Zoe said she's probably too old to know what the true song of the summer is, but she voted for this one, the one we're hearing now, Fetty Wap, "Trap Queen."

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TRAP QUEEN")

FETTY WAP: (Rapping) She my trap queen, let her hit the bando. We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go. We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos. At 56 a gram, 5 a 100 grams though...

SMITH: Let us know what you thought of today's show. We are planetmoney@npr.org, or on Twitter @PlanetMoney.

CHACE: I'm Zoe Chace.

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TRAP QUEEN")

FETTY WAP: (Rapping) And I get high with my baby. I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah. And I can ride with my baby. I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah. And I can ride with my baby. I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah.

So you have been dissecting this song for weeks now
I've heard it playing out of your cubicle over and over again through the day
And you're gonna walk us through step-by-step how much it costs to make the song and then our listeners can decide
If it was worth it in the end, okay
So, let's start it might not surprise you to know the making of the song doesn't actually begin with Rihanna herself
Right Rihanna gets a bad rap on that, but it's not like Frank Sinatra wrote lady is a tramp
You know, like this is not a new thing for pop music like songs used to be manufactured in a building
It was called a hit factory like the Motown building in Detroit and the Brill building in New York
And pop songs are still made in a factory, but it's a temporary factory and these days you call it a writing camp
And at a writing camp a record label hires the best producers and music writers in the country
Flies them all into the same city and drops them into nicest recording studios in that city for like two weeks
And I talked to someone who was there when man down was written. It's like, you know all-star game you get everybody in
That's Ray Daniels he's manager of a songwriting team called Rock City
Rock City was invited to the Rihanna writing camp in LA
This was March of 2010 and that brings us to the first cost of a hit song
Which is the cost of renting all those studios that make up a writing camp
Let's say if you got 10 rooms working every day them rooms are costing anywhere between $20,000 to $30,000
Let's say if you got 10 rooms working every day them rooms are costing anywhere between
$2,000 and $2,500 per day per room. You got 10 rooms going that's $25,000 per day
Okay, okay. I'm gonna actually keep the tally here. So we know where we're at
$25,000 and that's not including like, you know the masseuse and the nice dinner they go out to right
So $25,000 a day and what are they doing this whole time? Okay
Let's take the room where man down was created
It's a recording studio two brothers Timothy and Teron Thomas
They're the songwriters. They are the songwriters and they are matched up with a producer, which is this guy sham
Joseph the songwriters brought an idea for the song to the writing camp. They were sort of thinking about it
They knew it was Rihanna. She's from Barbados and they were thinking let's do this female response to Bob Marley's
I shot the sheriff right this is a good idea and the producer sham
Joseph had come to the writing camp just with his laptop with a bunch of beats a bunch of music on the laptop
No words, so there's no musicians involved at this point. No no instruments. Okay, nobody would play instruments
No instruments. So the songwriters and the producers in the studio
Sham opens up his laptop. He plays the track
No lyrics at this point. The songwriters are listening to the track
They'll go into the booth and they'll hum the record they're just say a melody
And they start to come up with this little melody
You know the part over the top of the music that you'll actually sing along to as they're standing there
They're listening to this. They're going man down
Yeah, exactly. It happens very very quickly. Just listen to the demo that was created
You can actually hear one of the writers singing the songs
I put out that gun
They already had the concept remember so when they put the lyrics down on paper and recorded it all happens pretty quickly
They literally wrote man down about 12 13 minutes
12 I
Love that like the whole creative process of a song takes place in in the period of time
It would take me to go get a cup of coffee at Starbucks
Yes, it's actually really hard to do that to come up with these lyrics
So and the other thing is they're not just writing one song
They have to come up with dozens and dozens of these songs because at the end of the two weeks
Rihanna is gonna come in listen to all the demos and pick her favorites for the album
Her record label Def Jam foots the bill for this entire process. It had to cost at least 200 grand
I mean it was the least 40 guys out there
Like I was shocked how much money they were spending
But guess what they got the whole album out of that one can't okay
So they write the whole album in that couple of weeks and I'm just gonna crunch the numbers here
So we can keep track the camp costs around two hundred thousand dollars, right?
And there are 11 tracks on the new Rihanna album. So that's 11 potential hit singles
She's great. And so you divide two hundred thousand by eleven and you get I don't know around eighteen thousand dollars
So for our example of man down we can say that the expense of writing this song cost eighteen thousand dollars
No, no, no, no, no. No, that's just for the overhead the rooms and the dinners
The songwriter and the producer each get a fee for their service after the song was picked
So it's fifteen thousand to the writer and twenty thousand to the person who did the music. Okay, okay
1815 20 I'm adding this up and the total is
Fifty three thousand dollars spent so far on man down, but at this point like there's there's no actual Rihanna on it
Right, that's the money laid out before Rihanna even steps into the studio and when Rihanna steps into the studio
She brings her vocal producer and the vocal producer tells Rihanna how to sing the song
I need you to belt this out. I need you to scream this as if you're
You're on one end of the block and you're trying to talk to somebody three blocks away
That's Rihanna's vocal producer McKeever Riddick and she didn't actually do man down
But she's coach Rihanna so many times through voicing chart-topping singles that I just called her up and asked her how much she costs
It can start anywhere between ten to fifteen thousand dollars
To go in and do a song and it sounds expensive but picture the working conditions
Okay, McKeever Riddick explained to me it's not just Rihanna in the booth and the vocal producer in the control room in the studio
It's like a party is going on. There's 30 to 40 people there
You know the artists entourage and people's phones are going off. They're ordering in food
It's it's like a mini music video or something. They'll have
You know strobe lights, you know, they'll have
Incense burning they'll have smoke machines and they'll have dove
Have you really ever seen that? Yes, I have doves like like the birds
Like like a prince video or a John Woo film slow-motion doves flying to help you sing. Yeah
Okay doves actually helped me track the podcast. So you're demanding that way
Yeah doves
But the thing is the job of the vocal producer is to get the song done and the label
President could and often will just show up at five in the morning. Like where's Rihanna's vocals
you know, are you done and
Rihanna doesn't need doves flying around the studio
Riddick says Rihanna's very focused and she wouldn't tell me exactly what Rihanna needs to get in the mood
Okay, so for the tally we will not count the bird wrangler
I'm just gonna write down
$15,000 and that's for the vocal coaching to focus you while the party rages around you, right?
Then the song gets mixed, you know
The vocal and the music put together then the song is mastered and entirely different studio and altogether that adds another
10k or so
It's a lot of money to make a superstars record, but only superstars get that treatment
All right mathematics time
We have the cost of the writing camp the songwriter the producer the vocal coach the room rental
Whatever birds are involved an engineer mixing
My total here is $78,000 so far and
We have a finished song, right? Okay. You do have a song but nobody's heard that song yet
So you don't have a hit song, right?
$78,000 is pennies compared to what comes next to make it a hit. Here's manager Ray Daniels a
rollout of one record might cost a million dollars
The reason why it cost so much is cuz you need everybody to move at once
You want them to turn on the radio here Rihanna Rihanna's live in studio 92 3 now
Turn on BET and see Rihanna
To Rihanna's latest video man down
When you look on billboard, you look on the iTunes chart
Loudest number one on iTunes
I need to pay to make sure the record is on iTunes when you log on to Apple Store
I want you to see Rihanna first all of that cost. I need everything
To click at once that's what the money comes from and he said a million dollars up there at the top a million dollars
But you know before I add that to this tally, I mean that seems like a lot of money
Just to roll out a record. What does it take? What do they do with that? Okay
So to get the song into everybody's ears, you know, you need marketing
So you need billboards commercials banner ads on iTunes
You have to move the artists all around the country to different radio stations to do interviews
And you're paying for radio play
Paola
Paola call it what you want in order to have a hit song. It has to be on the radio
It costs money to get a song on blast on every radio station at the same time
I'm gonna give you an example of how it works how far the record labels will go to make a hit
This song is from 2001
Of course, that's Jennifer Lopez and I mean listen that is a good song. I remember this song
It's got a great song good hook. I remember hearing it on the radio, right?
Well, it's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
It's a good song
I remember hearing it on the radio, right?
Well, one of the reasons that you know that song
one of the reasons that you heard it on the radio is because the record label bribed DJs to play it and
We know this from court cases and I saw that in order to get that song played on the radio in Buffalo
the record label paid the radio programmers
nine hundred thirty nine dollars
I saw this in the court documents. Well, that's very precise
$939 gets you AirPlay and Buffalo.
And that's just Buffalo.
I mean, imagine what it costs to get JLo in New York
or on an LA station or across the country.
So I talked to somebody who was a programmer back then
in the early 2000s.
And his name is Paul Porter.
And these days, he runs a media watchdog group
called Industry Ears.
But he used to be a video programmer for BET.
And he explains it like this.
The labels didn't pay for one record.
They would pay for a relationship with the station.
The song request would come way later.
You don't get bought on certain records.
You get paid first,
and then people come back and ask you favors.
So here's, for example,
I go to New York for a weekend.
I take the Excella up.
I stay at the Soho Grand.
It's a beautiful, luxurious, all-glass room.
I get tickets to see the Knicks.
I go over to somebody's house,
pick up an envelope that has $5,000 in it.
I have a great weekend.
I go back.
And I don't hear from the person for weeks.
Then I hear about an R. Kelly video.
It's a 10-minute video.
And it was like a pop country song.
It was not a BET thing.
And my darling, you,
you would be mine.
In the song, some people liked it,
but it's 10 minutes of R. Kelly,
and it sucked to me.
But the guy had been so nice.
I had a great weekend.
He never, ever asked me anything.
And he said,
Paul, look, I just need to get this played
a couple of times.
That's all he asked for, not major rotation.
It was 10 minutes, and I played it.
Now, I know you have these stories
of this happening in the past.
Everyone's very careful to say,
oh, this is how it used to be.
But is it happening today?
I mean, if Man Down is gonna get played on the radio,
and we already said it could take a million dollars
to do it,
is any of that money actually going toward Paola?
This is where it gets complicated.
It's fuzzy, okay?
Five years ago, everything changed
in the relationship between the record companies
and the radio stations.
Because Eliot Spitzer, before the scandal,
and before he was governor of New York,
he was New York's attorney general,
and he was a big anti-corruption guy.
So in 2006, he launched this big investigation
into Paola practices, and he uncovered a lot.
That's how I got the information about J. Lo.
And he got all the major labels
and all the major programmers to admit
that bribes for song play had been rampant
through the 90s and into the 2000s,
and they all paid huge fines
and set up new compliance standards.
But you just told me that the record labels
still have these huge budgets for radio.
If they're not using it for outright Paola,
for bribery, then what are they spending the money on?
Well, it's a little unclear, right?
Paul Porter, the former programmer
who played that R. Kelly song,
claims that FedEx trucks are still showing up
on Saturday mornings with envelopes full of $100 bills,
but he didn't give me any evidence
of outright Paola that's happening right now.
And Ray Daniels, our industry insider
that we spoke to in the beginning,
I asked him about this too, of course,
and he says, since Spitzer, it's not so overt.
He would characterize it more
as a nice date versus prostitution.
Radio, you're talking about treating the radio guys nice
and telling them, start it off in the mix, yo.
I need 75 spins a week.
No, I need this station to play this record
100 times a week.
You want me to play your music, treat me good.
It's like if you want something from a girl.
What you want, when you want to get a girl,
when you want her to be yours, what you gotta do?
You gotta treat her nice.
Take on the restaurants that are expensive,
buy her expensive gifts, you gotta treat her nice.
That don't mean you're paying for her.
That mean you're paying to show her
that you're serious about her.
I'm not gonna call it payola, but I will say that.
There's something I just do not understand about this
that seems so weird to me,
which is why is this pay-all even illegal
in the first place?
Why is it unethical to pay some money
to advertise your album, basically,
by putting a song on the air?
I think about grocery stores,
and serial companies pay grocery stores a stocking fee
so that they get good placement in the grocery store.
I think about movies,
where companies will pay the movie producers money
in order to put their products in their product placement.
All this seems perfectly normal,
but when it comes to radio stations,
all of a sudden everybody's like,
oh no, it's illegal, you can't pay money
to put a song on the radio.
I mean, that's a good point,
but the argument is that radio is different.
Elliot Spitzer, when he did his investigation,
he said that pay for play is deception.
So you know when a radio DJ says,
we're playing the best music
of the 80s, 90s, and today.
Yeah, our number one song today is.
Is that the best music?
If those songs are just paid for,
then that's kind of a lie,
and Spitzer argued that it's fraud.
Furthermore, the radio waves
are officially public property.
They are regulated by the FCC,
and radio stations just rent the frequency.
It's regulated by the government.
Taking money to promote a song
is not considered legally to be in the public interest.
So if you do pay for a song to be on the radio,
you're supposed to disclose it.
Like say, this song by Lady Gaga
was just aired because of money donated
to my sell a ticket from Interscope,
or you know, something to that effect.
I still think it's ridiculous,
because you know, these same radio stations
play songs called jingles.
They play the 1-800-M-800 mattress jingle,
and they get paid for playing that song,
but oh no, no, you all of a sudden play man down,
take a little money, that's all of a sudden wrong?
That seems kind of arbitrary.
The argument is actually whether payola even works,
because a radio station is not gonna put a lousy song
into heavy rotation just because they're paid
a lot of money to do it,
because they'll lose all their listeners if they do that.
Their listeners will change the station.
And so radio stations are constantly testing this out,
and they have market research groups
testing Rihanna songs,
and seeing which ones have the potential to be big hits.
Speaking of big hits, let's see if Rihanna made it.
Mr. DJ, Jess Jang, turn the music up.
All right, it is time to total up the bill
for Rihanna's Man Down.
We got the writing camp, the songwriters,
the producers, and the mixers, that's 78,000,
and we add in the radio,
however they get the money to them,
the tour and the marketing,
and the grand total to create and market
Man Down by Rihanna is $1,078,000.
Oh, and the video drop.
Oh yeah, you forgot the video.
We're not even talking about the fact
that a video costs $100,000 to $150,000.
This is money.
We're talking about money
just for something that might not work.
All right, a million and a quarter with the video.
And the final question, I guess,
is what did they get for their investment?
I mean, how's Man Down doing?
Well.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me after all this work,
after all this whole podcast?
Basically, let me put it like this,
I've been playing it more at Planet Money
than it's been playing in the entire country
this week.
I mean, it hasn't sold that well.
Radio play has been minimal,
but that's how it goes with the song of the summer.
It's been a few years
since we originally aired this podcast.
And so I think we can, at this point,
definitively say that Rihanna's Man Down
did not become the song of the summer that year.
She ran headlong into a woman named Adele
with a song you've probably heard of,
Rolling in the Deep.
I called up Zoe and I said,
hey, it's 2015, what is the song of this summer?
Go.
And Zoe said she's probably too old
to know what the true song of the summer is,
but she voted for this one,
the one we're hearing now,
Fetty Wap, Trap Queen.
Let us know what you thought of today's show.
We're Planet Money at npr.org
or on Twitter at Planet Money.
I'm Zoe Chase.
And I'm Robert Smith.
Thanks for listening.
