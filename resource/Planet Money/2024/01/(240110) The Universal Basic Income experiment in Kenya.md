There's this fundamental question in economics that has proven really hard to answer: What's a good way to help people out of poverty? The old-school way was to fund programs that would support very particular things, like buying cows for a village, giving people business training, or building schools.

But over the past few decades, there has been a new idea: Could you help people who don't have money by ... just giving them money? We covered this question in a segment of This American Life that originally ran in 2013. Economists who studied the question found that giving people cash had positive effects on recipients' economic and psychological well-being. Maybe they bought a cow that could earn them money each week. Maybe they could replace their grass roofs with metal roofs that didn't need fixing every so often.

Episode 480: The Charity That Just Gives People Money

The success of just giving people in poverty cash has spawned a whole set of new questions that economists are now trying to answer. Like, if we do just give money, what's the best way to do that? Do you just give it all at once? Or do you dole it out over time? And it turns out... a huge new study on giving cash was just released and it's got a lot of answers.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

DAVE BLANCHARD, HOST:

There's this fundamental question in economics that has proven really hard to answer - how to spend money to help people out of poverty. The old-school way of doing it was to fund programs that would support very particular things - buying cows for a village or giving people business training or building schools.

AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:

But over the past few decades, there has been a new idea. What if the cure for people not having money was just giving them money, no strings attached? The argument for this idea is people know their own situation best. They can decide if they need a cow or training or a school. They just need some money.

BLANCHARD: This idea has spawned a whole new set of questions that economists are trying to answer. Like, if we do just give money, what's the best way to do that? Do you just give it all at once, or do you dole it out over time, like through what's called a universal basic income? Well, a huge new study on giving cash was just released, and it's got a lot of answers.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLANCHARD: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Dave Blanchard.

ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Today on the show - what have we learned about the best ways to give money to people who need it?

BLANCHARD: We go to Kenya and hear from gossipy neighbors. We find out what people spend their money on when there are no strings attached, and we discover how a cow might be a better bank than a bank.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLANCHARD: At PLANET MONEY, we've been interested in this idea of just giving cash to people in poverty for a long time. We covered a major study that looked into this back in 2013. And at the time, the just-give-cash idea was still really novel.

ARONCZYK: The study was run by this nonprofit called GiveDirectly. Back then, they gave a few hundred thousand dollars to over 500 households in rural Kenya.

BLANCHARD: So in today's episode, we're going to first listen back to our original reporting on that study from 2013. Then, in the second half of the show, we're going to hear about what we've learned since then.

ARONCZYK: In our original episode, Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum traveled to Kenya. They visited one of the villages where some of the residents had received money.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCVHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

JACOB GOLDSTEIN: To get to this one village, you drive on the main road, past the sign that says equator - because that's where the equator is - and then you turn off onto these increasingly rough dirt roads and you have to stop and ask for directions. Eventually, you have to get out of the car and walk down a path.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)

GOLDSTEIN: It's very green. There are trees and birds, little farm plots where people are growing corn. And then finally, by the side of the path, you find the guy who got the money on his phone.

(SOUNDBITE OF NOKIA STARTUP TONE)

BERNARD OMONDI: Nokia.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: This is Bernard Omondi (ph). He's 25 years old. He's got two kids. He lives in a small house with mud walls, a dirt floor and an old couch. There's no sink 'cause there's no plumbing. There's no running water. There's no electricity.

The way it all happened, he says, is that, one day, the village elder came by with some people he'd never met. They explained that they wanted to give him $1,000, which, to him, seemed like a very strange idea.

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) I had to be suspicious because, in African setup, we believe you cannot - somebody cannot give you such kind of huge money without working for it. Even our own president cannot give you, so I had to be suspicious.

KESTENBAUM: But Omondi said, fine. I'm a poor man. You want to give me money? I'm not going to say no. The visitors gave him a cheap cellphone. And then a while later, he got the text message.

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) It was sent very early in the morning. I was still in my bed. I jumped up. My wife asked me, Bernard, what is it? Then I told her, the guys of GiveDirect (ph) have sent us the money. It's here.

GOLDSTEIN: He still has the message on his phone.

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) Confirm you have received 41,000 (non-English language spoken).

GOLDSTEIN: All over the village that morning, people were getting their first payment from GiveDirectly and having that jump-out-of-bed experience.

DANIEL OTIENO OMBOCK: (Non-English language spoken).

GOLDSTEIN: This is one of Bernard's neighbors, Daniel Otieno Ombock (ph).

OMBOCK: (Through interpreter) I got the message when I was in bed. And I told my wife, hey, you also read this message. She immediately - she saw it and read - she burst into laughter. She laughed and told me, now, my husband, what do we do?

KESTENBAUM: It's worth pointing out just how much money a thousand dollars is in this village. A thousand dollars is about what one of these families spends in an entire year. So you could think of it as someone coming up and offering to double your salary. But really, it's a much bigger deal than that. Most of the people in this village have no savings at all, so a thousand dollars is just this unimaginable sum. Daniel had never had this much money at once - nothing close to it.

GOLDSTEIN: So what do you do when more money than you've ever had in your life suddenly drops onto your cellphone? If you're Bernard Omondi, you buy one of these.

(SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE STARTING)

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) This motorcycle is called Bajaj Boxer. It consumes low fuel.

KESTENBAUM: The motorcycle cost him about 600 bucks. And this is not the kind of motorcycle you ride around so everyone will think you're cool. Around here, where most people live on dirt paths too narrow for cars, motorcycles are basically used as taxis. And Bernard bought his so he could become a taxi driver. It beat his old job. He used to work as a laborer. Often, he would spend all day carrying heavy stones from one place to another. That's when he could find work. A lot of days, there was no work at all. Now that he has his motorcycle, he says his work is much steadier. His kids used to go hungry. They don't anymore.

GOLDSTEIN: People bought all kinds of things with the money. One family bought a little mill to grind corn for people in the village. Another started selling soap and cooking oil. Daniel Otieno Ombock, the other guy who jumped out of bed when he got the message, bought something he'd always wanted.

OMBOCK: (Non-English language spoken) mattress high-density beds.

GOLDSTEIN: Mattress high density bed, it turns out, is basically just a mattress. He used to sleep on a mat on the ground.

OMBOCK: (Through interpreter) Now I look like a human being. I'm now a human being.

GOLDSTEIN: What were you before?

UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Non-English language spoken).

(LAUGHTER)

OMBOCK: (Non-English language spoken).

UNIDENTIFIED INTERPRETER: (Non-English language spoken).

OMBOCK: (Through interpreter) Before, I was an image of a human being. But in a real sense, I wasn't a human being.

(Non-English language spoken).

KESTENBAUM: The thing that really changed his life, he says, was the new roof. Daniel bought a metal roof to replace his old one, which was made of grass. He showed it to us.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR SHUTTING)

KESTENBAUM: And if buying a new roof sounds like something that's nice to have but isn't really going to help Daniel in the long run, you've probably never owned a grass roof. Just about everyone we talked to had replaced their grass roofs with metal ones.

CAROLYN ADIAMBO: I was just very happy (laughter). I was very happy about the money.

GOLDSTEIN: This is Carolyn Adiambo (ph), who also bought a metal roof and who explained why everyone was doing it. First of all, grass roofs are terrible roofs. They leak, failing to perform what is arguably the single most important job of any roof. When it rains, everything you own gets wet. It's hard to sleep. You have to keep moving around to find a dry spot. But also, grass roofs need to be constantly maintained. You have to keep replacing the grass, and apparently you can't just cut any grass from the field. You need a special kind of grass, and often you have to pay for it.

ADIAMBO: The grass is very expensive because you have to buy grass every year - even three times a year - and it costs a lot.

GOLDSTEIN: A metal roof costs more upfront - two or three hundred dollars - but it can last for more than 10 years. And in the long run, it's way cheaper than a grass roof. So buying that metal roof means that, every year, Carolyn and the others won't have to spend money buying new grass. It's like they just boosted their income for the next decade. They'll have more money in their pockets - money to pay for school fees or food or to buy a cow.

KESTENBAUM: And buying a cow - that was also really common.

GOLDSTEIN: Oh, yeah. That's your cow.

OMBOCK: (Through interpreter) I named her Apala (ph). It's a female cow - a very good one 'cause it produces milk - a lot of milk.

KESTENBAUM: Daniel told us his cow cost about $400. He says it produces two liters of milk a day. His family drinks one liter and sells one liter for about 50 cents. Carolyn also bought a cow, but she says, don't think of it as a cow. Think of hers as a bank.

ADIAMBO: The cows are just like bank. Yeah. When we put it there, it's just as if we have saved it in the cow.

GOLDSTEIN: And why buy a cow instead of putting the money in the bank?

ADIAMBO: Eh - in the bank. You know, money in the bank - sometimes you can just go and take it - small, small, small, small, small - until it got finished.

KESTENBAUM: A cow, on the other hand, you can't fritter away a few shillings at a time. If you want to get your money out of a cow, you have to take your cow to market and sell it.

GOLDSTEIN: All these things people spent money on - cows, roofs, a motorcycle - they seem like reasonable choices. In fact, they seemed so reasonable, we started to worry that people were just telling us the good-news stories. So we asked a different question - not what did you do with the money, but what did your neighbors do?

KESTENBAUM: And then we started to hear different stories. Bernard told us, sure, I spent the money well, but not everybody did.

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) There are so many guys who are very careless. And I know, as you are going to walk around in some homes, you're going to see guys who misused their money. You'll get that some of them didn't even put up a house, didn't even buy a motorcycle. Some of them are still staying in their grass-thatched houses. Yeah, you just see there's nothing - there's no change in his life, and they misused the money.

GOLDSTEIN: What did they do with the money?

OMONDI: (Through interpreter) Some of them are drunkards, so they probably used it to buy alcohol. Others just spent the whole amount on food. They just ate and became fat, and there's nothing to see. Nothing has remained of it.

KESTENBAUM: Bernard didn't name anyone in particular. But another guy in the village - a guy named Julius (ph) - said, my neighbor right over here - look, he still has a thatched roof on his house. He wasted his money. He was so embarrassed he didn't even want to talk to you.

JULIUS: (Through interpreter) He saw your vehicle, and he knew that you were around. He decided to run away. That - they're nowhere now.

KESTENBAUM: So we went to the neighbor's house and, just like Julius said, he wasn't home. There were two little kids there who told us that their parents had gone into town.

GOLDSTEIN: It seemed like Julius might be right. So we asked GiveDirectly about the neighbor. And a woman named Lydia Tala, who works for GiveDirectly and is from the region, managed to reach him on the phone the next day. He told her he wasn't hiding, and he wasn't embarrassed. He said his first wife had died. He wanted to get remarried. But in this part of Kenya, the groom traditionally has to pay the bride's family. So that's what he spent the money on. He spent it on a dowry so he could get remarried, and that's why he still had a thatched roof.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLANCHARD: That was Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum back in 2013. And in the years since that study, giving cash unconditionally to help people out of poverty has become more common for development economics. Critics used to worry that the money would be wasted by the recipients. But in part because of this very study, many economists have come to recognize that when you give people in poverty money, they usually do smart things with it. They don't waste it.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARONCZYK: So that answers the question of whether just giving cash can help people out of poverty. It can. Now the question has turned to how best to give people that money. GiveDirectly has been researching this very question. After the break, we find out what they've learned.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLANCHARD: So yes, giving cash to people in poverty with no strings attached seems to work. Now, what's the best way to give people that cash?

ARONCZYK: One proposal is giving everyone in a community small amounts of money on a regular basis - say, monthly. This is known as universal basic income - or UBI. So economists are asking, if we want to help people out of poverty, is the UBI model a good way to do it?

BLANCHARD: One of the people interested in this question? - Nobel-Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee. I called him up to talk recently, but he was having a little trouble with our annoying recording setup and his headphones.

ABHIJIT BANERJEE: I'm actually not terrible at these things.

BLANCHARD: OK.

BANERJEE: It's just - I have two headphones. If I can make one of them work...

BLANCHARD: (Laughter).

BANERJEE: ...I shouldn't be embarrassing.

BLANCHARD: You clearly have other strengths. If you've got a Nobel Prize, I don't think you have to beat yourself up for not being able to make the Bluetooth headphones work, you know?

BANERJEE: Yes.

ARONCZYK: For many years, Abhijit had been interested in the question of how to help people out of poverty and also in this idea of universal basic income. Then, several years after the GiveDirectly study from our original story, he was approached by the co-founder of GiveDirectly, an economist named Paul Niehaus, because Paul had an idea for a new research study.

BANERJEE: Paul pitched it to me, saying, you are interested in all these issues. Do you want to be involved in a UBI evaluation?

BLANCHARD: Abhijit was intrigued. Economists in a lot of different fields were interested in UBI as a better way to help poor people, but he felt this study could go further. For the study to be really useful, he thought, they would need to compare giving everyone in a village small, regular monthly payments like a UBI against giving everyone one big lump sum all at once.

BANERJEE: I was, from the beginning, saying, we need to benchmark it to a lump sum.

BLANCHARD: Why?

BANERJEE: I thought one problem with UBI is that it's small amounts of money every month. And the problem is that people are - find it very difficult to save at home. And that was - so from the beginning, my concern is that is it this - is this going to be too much of a challenge for these people to turn their small amounts into a larger amount, which they'll need to really start a business? So that was the - very much the thinking behind the lump sum.

BLANCHARD: Was there a moment when you worried that the lump sum wasn't going to make it in amongst all these discussions?

BANERJEE: I - you know, I tend to be very, let's say, stubborn. So I was going to fight that one out.

ARONCZYK: Eventually, Abhijit got his way. The study compares monthly and lump-sum payments. In some villages, everyone got a lump sum of $500 all at once. In other villages, people got monthly payments of about $22 a month. First payments went out in 2018.

JANE MARTHA ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) When they came to our village, they first walked all through the village.

BLANCHARD: This is Jane Martha Achieng Adongo (ph). She remembers the first time GiveDirectly came to her small village. It's called Magawa. It's in western Kenya, on the plains, close to Lake Victoria. There's a lot of trees surrounding the village, a lot of farms.

(SOUNDBITE OF COWS MOOING)

BLANCHARD: What's the noise in the background?

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) They're just cows passing by.

BLANCHARD: OK.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) They're going to drink water in the lake.

ARONCZYK: Yeah, do not get in the way of that cow.

BLANCHARD: (Laughter) That cow wants its water.

ARONCZYK: (Laughter).

BLANCHARD: Now, when GiveDirectly came to the village, Jane Martha had a similar reaction to Bernard Omondi from our original story. She was skeptical.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) When someone comes to the village and tells you that they are going to give you money, I do not believe. But the moment I received my first amount, I was very happy.

BLANCHARD: Jane Martha was in one of the monthly payments groups for the study, not the lump sum group. Now, she already had a small business that sold bread and clothes, but this new monthly payment allowed her to expand and sell more things.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) Apart from the clothes, I am currently also selling plastics.

BLANCHARD: What kind of plastics?

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) I am selling plastic utensils. I am selling lunchbox. I'm also selling plastic chairs, and I'm also selling jugs.

BLANCHARD: And would that have been possible before these payments?

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) That was not possible.

ARONCZYK: The extra money helped her to also build a new house. It has three rooms, and it's a lot nicer than her old house. But for the purposes of Abhijit's study, there was one really interesting thing that Jane Martha and other people in her village did with their monthly payments.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) When we started receiving money from GiveDirectly, there was a woman who came and approached - asked 10 of us to form a merry-go-round.

BLANCHARD: A woman in her village approached her about forming a merry-go-round, she said.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) And when I say merry-go-round, what I mean is everyone contributes a certain amount of money every month from their transfers, and it's given to one person.

ARONCZYK: The people in the merry-go-round pool their money each month and give one big payment to one person in the group. Each month, a different person gets that big payment. In the end, Jane Martha got the same amount as her monthly payments, but as one big chunk. This is actually pretty common in areas without access to banks because it's an effective way to save money.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) The merry-go-round is helping us to at least have a lump-sum amount for you to be able to do something bigger at once.

BLANCHARD: Hmm. So getting a bigger lump sum is more useful at times than getting a smaller monthly payment.

ACHIENG ADONGO: (Through interpreter) Yeah. Getting money from a merry-go-round in a lump sum is better for me.

ARONCZYK: And our economist and researcher Abhijit Banerjee found it wasn't just Jane Martha's village doing this. A lot of villages were turning their monthly payments - or their UBI payments - into lump sums.

BANERJEE: That's beautiful. In a sense, that's the kind of thing, when you see it, you say, OK, the world makes sense.

BLANCHARD: At the beginning of the study, Abhijit had been concerned that the monthly payments wouldn't be as effective as lump-sum payments in helping people out of poverty. And he was potentially right. But the participants in the study found a solution to that on their own.

BANERJEE: They are doing what you would think you would do, which is - I really need 500, and I have 22. How do I get from 22 to 500? I put it in a merry-go-round. Eventually, it's going to be my turn. And when it does, I'm going to have my 500, and I'm going to build my new shop or whatever it is.

BLANCHARD: So the goal of Abhijit and his co-authors in this study was to figure out how effective a universal basic income could be - you know, getting regular monthly payments - and then to compare that to a lump sum.

ARONCZYK: We now have the results for the initial two years of the study. When it came to the villages getting the monthly payments, there were certain aspects where they performed better than the lump-sum villages. There were lower incidences of depression, which makes some sense. Being certain that money is coming in regularly might relieve some stress.

BLANCHARD: And the results also addressed a fear some critics of UBI have - that people will get checks monthly and just stop working. The study showed a lot of participants did work less - for other people. They instead started their own businesses and ended up working the same amount but for themselves.

ARONCZYK: But overall, when it came to the question of which payment approach would lift more people out of poverty, at this point in time, the lump sum seems to be more effective, which is what Jane Martha told us. The researchers found that the villages where people received a lump-sum payment - they started more businesses. Those businesses made more money, and people overall had higher incomes.

BLANCHARD: There is one more aspect of the study to share. There were actually two groups getting monthly payments - two different UBI groups. One group got payments for just two years. They were the short-term group. The other is going to keep getting them for a total of 12 years - the long-term group. And when Abhijeet looked at the results of the first two years of the study...

BANERJEE: What's striking is the short-term and the long-term don't look the same. They have each got 24 months of the same amount of money, but they are behaving entirely differently.

BLANCHARD: For two years, both groups got the same amount in the same way monthly. But just knowing that they'd be getting money for 12 years made the long-term group behave differently.

ARONCZYK: People getting short-term monthly payments experienced the least benefit of any group in the study. But people getting those long-term monthly payments - oddly, their results looked similar to the lump-sum group. This was the group that Jane Martha was in. And like her, a lot of people in this group joined merry-go-rounds. They became planners. They saved their money. In short, they invested in their futures.

BLANCHARD: The program will end in 2030. Until then, Abhijeet and other researchers will keep collecting data to try to answer what he calls the cosmic things - big-picture questions, like, will the group of people receiving monthly payments keep saving? And will the positive results of the study persist even after the payments stop, or will the participants wind up back where they started?

is that one day the village elder came by with some people he'd never met.
They explained that they wanted to give him one thousand dollars,
which to him seemed like a very strange idea.
I had to be suspicious because in an African setup, we believe
you cannot, somebody cannot give you such kind of huge money without working for it.
Even our own president cannot give you. So I had to be suspicious.
But Mundi said, fine, I'm a poor man. You want to give me money?
I'm not going to say no. The visitors gave him a cheap cell phone.
And then a while later, he got the text message.
It was sent very early in the morning.
I was still in my bed. I jumped up.
My wife asked me, Bernard, what is it?
Then I told her the guys of GiveDirect have sent us the money. It's here.
He still has the message on his phone. Confirm you have received 41,000.
All over the village that morning,
people were getting their first payment from GiveDirectly and having that
jump out of bed experience.
This is one of Bernard's neighbors, Daniel Otieno Ombok.
I got the message when I was in bed and I told my wife, hey, you also read this message.
She immediately, she saw it and read. She burst into laughter.
She laughed and told me now, my husband, what do we do?
It's worth pointing out just how much money $1,000 is in this village.
$1,000 is about what one of these families spends in an entire year.
So you could think of it as someone coming up and offering to double your salary.
But really, it's a much bigger deal than that.
Most of the people in this village have no savings at all.
So $1,000 is just this unimaginable sum.
Daniel had never had this much money at once. Nothing close to it.
So what do you do when more money than you've ever had in your life suddenly drops off?
This suddenly drops onto your cell phone. If you're Bernardo Mundi, you buy one of these.
The motorcycle cost him about $600.
And this is not the kind of motorcycle you ride around so everyone will think you're cool.
Around here, where most people live on dirt paths too narrow for cars,
motorcycles are basically used as taxis.
And Bernard bought his so he could become a taxi driver.
It beat his old job. He used to work as a laborer.
Often he would spend all day carrying heavy stones from one place to another.
That's when he could find work. A lot of days, there was no work at all.
Now that he has his motorcycle, he says his work is much steadier.
His kids used to go hungry. They don't anymore.
People bought all kinds of things with the money.
One family bought a little mill to grind corn for people in the village.
Another started selling soap and cooking oil.
Daniel Otieno Mbok, the other guy who jumped out of bed when he got the message,
bought something he'd always wanted.
Mattress, high-density beds.
Mattress, high-density bed, it turns out, is basically just a mattress.
He used to sleep on a mat on the ground.
Now I look like a human being. I'm not a human being.
What were you before?
Before I was an image of a human being, but in real sense, I wasn't a human being.
The thing that really changed his life, he says, was the new roof.
Daniel bought a metal roof to replace his old one, which was made of grass.
He showed it to us.
And if buying a new roof sounds like something that's nice to have,
but isn't really going to help Daniel in the long run,
you've probably never owned a grass roof.
Just about everyone we talked to had replaced their grass roofs with metal ones.
I was just very happy. I was very happy about the man.
This is Carolyn Adhiambo, who also bought a metal roof
and who explained why everyone was doing it.
First of all, grass roofs are terrible roofs.
They leak, failing to perform what is arguably the simplest way
to do the single most important job of any roof.
When it rains, everything you own gets wet, it's hard to sleep.
You have to keep moving around to find a dry spot.
But also, grass roofs need to be constantly maintained.
You have to keep replacing the grass,
and apparently you can't just cut any grass from the field.
You need a special kind of grass, and often you have to pay for it.
The grass is very expensive because you have to buy grass every year,
three times, and it costs a lot.
A metal roof costs more upfront, two or three hundred dollars,
but it can last for more than ten years,
and in the long run, it's way cheaper than a grass roof.
So buying that metal roof means that every year,
Carolyn and the others won't have to spend money buying new grass.
It's like they just boosted their income for the next decade.
They'll have more money in their pockets,
money to pay for school fees or food or to buy a cow.
And buying a cow, that was also really common.
Yeah, that's your cow.
Daniel told us his cow cost about four hundred dollars.
He says it produces two liters of milk a day.
His family drinks one liter and sells one liter for about fifty cents.
Carolyn also bought a cow, but she says don't think of it as a cow.
Think of hers as a bank.
And why buy a cow instead of putting the money in the bank?
A cow, on the other hand, you can't fritter away a few shillings at a time.
If you want to get your money out of a cow,
you have to take your cow to market and sell it.
All these things people spent money on, cows, roofs, a motorcycle,
they seem like reasonable choices.
In fact, they seemed so reasonable,
we started to worry that people were just telling us the good news stories.
So we asked a different question, not what did you do with the money,
but what did your neighbors do?
And then we started to hear different stories.
Bernard told us, sure, I spent the money well, but not everybody did.
There's so many guys who are very careless,
and I know as you're going to walk around in some homes,
you're going to see guys who misuse their money.
You'll get that some of them didn't even put up a house,
didn't even buy a motorcycle.
Some of them are still staying in their garage house.
Yeah, you'll just see there's nothing,
there's no change in his life and they misuse the money.
What did they do with the money?
Some of them are drunkards, so they probably use it to buy alcohol.
Others just spend the whole amount on food.
They just ate and became fat and there's nothing to see.
Nothing has remained of it.
Bernard didn't name anyone in particular,
but another guy in the village, a guy named Julius, said,
My neighbor, right over here, look, he still has a thatched roof on his house.
He wasted his money.
He was so embarrassed, he didn't want to pay for it.
He saw your vehicle and he knew that you were around.
He decided to run away, but they're nowhere now.
So we went to the neighbor's house,
and just like Julius said, he wasn't home.
There were two little kids there who told us that their parents had gone into town.
It seemed like Julius might be right.
So we asked GiveDirectly about the neighbor and a woman named Lydia Tala,
who works for GiveDirectly and is from the region,
she told us that she was going to go to the neighbor's house.
The neighbor, who works for GiveDirectly and is from the region,
managed to reach him on the phone the next day.
He told her he wasn't hiding and he wasn't embarrassed.
He said his first wife had died.
He wanted to get remarried.
But in this part of Kenya, the groom traditionally has to pay the bride's family.
So that's what he spent the money on.
He spent it on a dowry so he could get remarried.
And that's why he still had a thatched roof.
That was Jacob Goldstein and David Kestenbaum back in 2013.
And in the years since that study,
giving cash unconditionally to help people out of poverty
has become more common for development economics.
Critics used to worry that the money would be wasted by the recipients.
But in part because of this very study,
many economists have come to recognize
that when you give people in poverty money,
they usually do smart things with it.
They don't waste it.
So that answers the question of whether just giving cash can help people out of poverty.
It can.
Now the question has turned to how best to give people that money.
GiveDirectly has been researching this very question.
After the break, we find out what they've learned.
Darien Woods here.
Now the saying goes, let's not reinvent the wheel.
But maybe we should reinvent that saying.
I find this expression that we shouldn't reinvent the wheel really annoying.
Because the fact is that ever since we did invent the wheel,
we have been reinventing it.
The wheel, the spoked wheel, the gear, and more.
The wheel's invention and reinvention throughout history
has been crucial to modern life and the economy.
Things that you invent for one purpose
can eventually end up doing completely new things that you never imagined.

So yes, giving cash to people in poverty with no strings attached seems to work.
Now, what's the best way to give people that cash?
One proposal is giving everyone in a community
small amounts of money on a regular basis,
say monthly.
This is known as Universal Basic Income, or UBI.
So economists are asking, if we want to help people out of poverty,
is the UBI model a good way to do it?
One of the people interested in the UBI model
is the UBI model a good way to do it?
One of the people interested in this question,
Nobel Prize winning economist Abhijit Banerjee.
I called him up to talk recently
but he was having a little trouble
with our annoying recording setup and his headphones.
I'm actually not terrible at these things.
I have two headphones.
If I can't make one of them work, it should be embarrassing.
You clearly have other strengths.
If you've got a Nobel Prize,
I don't think you have to beat yourself up
for not being able to make the Bluetooth headphones work.
For many years,
Abhijit had been interested in the question
of how to help people out of poverty
and also in this idea of Universal Basic Income.
Then, several years after the GiveDirectly study
from our original story,
he was approached by the co-founder of GiveDirectly,
an economist named Paul Niehaus,
because Paul had an idea for a new research study.
Paul used it to me saying,
you are interested in all these issues.
Do you want to be involved in a UBI evaluation?
Abhijit was intrigued.
Economists in a lot of different fields
were interested in UBI as a better way
to help poor people.
But he felt this study could go further.
For the study to be really useful, he thought,
they would need to compare
giving everyone in a village
small regular monthly payments, like a UBI,
against giving everyone one big lump sum all at once.
I was from the beginning saying
we need to benchmark it to a lump sum.
Why?
I thought one problem with UBI
is that it's small amounts of money every month.
And the problem is that
people are finding it very difficult to save at home.
And that was, from the beginning,
my concern is that
is this going to be too much of a challenge
for these people to turn their small amounts
into a larger amount,
which they'll need to really start a business.
So that was very much the thinking
behind the lump sum.
Was there a moment when you worried
that the lump sum wasn't going to make it in
amongst all these discussions?
You know, I tend to be very, very,
let's say stubborn.
So I was going to find that one out.
Eventually, Abhijit got his way.
The study compares monthly and lump sum payments.
In some villages,
everyone got a lump sum of $500 all at once.
In other villages,
people got monthly payments of about $22 a month.
First payments went out in 2018.
When they came to our village,
they first walked all through the village.
This is Jane Martha Achieng Adongo.
She remembers the first time
GiveDirectly came to her small village.
She said,
She remembers the first time
GiveDirectly came to her small village.
It's called Magawa.
It's in western Kenya, on the plains,
close to Lake Victoria.
There's a lot of trees surrounding the village,
a lot of farms.
What's the noise in the background?
Yeah, do not get in the way of that cow.
That cow wants its water.
Now, when GiveDirectly came
to the village,
Jane Martha had a similar reaction
to Bernard Amundi from our original story.
She was skeptical.
Jane Martha was in one of the monthly
payments groups for the study,
not the lump sum group.
Now, she already had a small business
that sold bread and clothes,
but this new monthly payment allowed her
to expand and sell more things.
Apart from the clothes,
I'm currently also selling plastics.
What kind of plastics?
I'm selling plastic utensils,
I'm selling lunchbox,
I'm also selling plastic chairs
and I'm also selling jacks.
And would that have been possible
before these payments?
That was not possible.
Jane Martha wanted to build a new house.
It has three rooms and it's a lot nicer
than her old house.
But for the purposes of Abagid's study,
there was one really interesting
thing that Jane Martha and other people
in her village did with their monthly payments.
When we started receiving money
directly, there was a woman
who came and approached us,
10 of us,
to form a merry-go-round.
A woman in her village approached her
about forming a merry-go-round,
she said.
And when I say merry-go-round,
what I mean is,
everyone contributes a certain amount of money
every month from their transfers
and it's given to one person.
Merry-go-round pool their money each month
and give one big payment
to one person in the group.
Each month, a different person gets that big payment.
In the end, Jane Martha got
the same amount as her monthly payments
but as one big chunk.
This is actually pretty common in areas
without access to banks,
because it's an effective way to save money.
So, getting a bigger lump sum
is more useful
at times than getting a smaller
monthly payment.
And our economist
and researcher Abhijit Banerjee found
it wasn't just Jane Martha's village
doing this.
A lot of villages were turning their monthly payments
or their UBI payments
into lump sums.
That's beautiful, in a sense that's
kind of thing when you see it, you say, okay,
the world makes sense.
At the beginning of the study, Abhijit had been concerned
that the monthly payments wouldn't be
as effective as lump sum payments
in helping people out of poverty.
He was potentially right
but the participants in the study found
a solution to that on their own.
They are doing what you would think
you would do, which is
I really need 500
and I have 22. How do I get
from 22 to 500?
If I put it in a merry-go-round,
eventually it's going to be my turn
and when it does, I'm going to have my 500
and I'm going to build my
new shop or whatever it is.
So the goal of Abhijit and his co-authors
in the study was to figure out how effective
a universal basic income could be.
You know, getting regular monthly payments.
And then to compare that
to a lump sum.
We now have the results for the initial two years
of the study. When it came to the villages
getting the monthly payments,
there were certain aspects where they performed
better than the lump sum villages.
There were lower incidences
of depression, which
makes some sense. Being certain
that money is coming in regularly
might relieve some stress.
And the results also addressed a fear
some critics of UBI have.
That people will get checks monthly
and just stop working. The study showed
a lot of participants did work
less for other people.
They instead started their own
businesses and ended up working the same amount
but for themselves.
But overall, when it came to the question
of which payment approach would lift more
people out of poverty, at this point
in time the lump sum seems
to be more effective.
Which is what Jane Martha told us.
The researchers found that the villages
where people received a lump sum payment
they started more businesses.
Those businesses made more money
and people overall had higher
incomes. There is
one more aspect of the study to share.
There were actually two
groups getting monthly payments.
Two different UBI groups.
One group got payments for just two
years. They were the short term group.
The other is going to keep getting
them for a total of 12 years.
The long term group.
And when Abhijit looked at the results of the first
two years of the study.
What's striking is the short term and the long term
don't look the same. They have
each got 24 months of the same
amount of money. But they are behaving
entirely differently.
For two years both groups got the same
amount in the same way monthly.
But just knowing that they'd be getting
money for 12 years made the long
term group behave differently.
People getting short term monthly payments
experienced the least benefit
of any group in the study.
But people getting those long term monthly
payments, oddly, their
results looked similar to the lump sum
group. This was the group
that Jane Martha was in. And like her,
a lot of people in this group joined
merry-go-rounds. They became planners.
They saved their money.
In short, they invested in their futures.
The program will end
in 2030. Until then,
Abhijit and other researchers will
keep collecting data to try to answer
what he calls the cosmic things.
Big picture questions like
will the group of people receiving
monthly payments keep saving?
And will the positive results of the study
persist even after the payments stop?
Or will the participants
wind up back where they started?
