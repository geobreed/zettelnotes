In 2022, artist Stuart Semple opened up his laptop to find that all his designs had turned black overnight. All the colors, across files on Adobe products like Photoshop and Illustrator, were gone. Who had taken the colors away? The story of what happened begins with one company, Pantone.

Pantone is known for their Color of the Year forecasts, but they actually make the bulk of their money from selling color reference guides. These guides are the standard for how designers pretty much anywhere talk about color.

On today's show, how did Pantone come to control the language of the rainbow? We look back at the history of Pantone, beginning with the man who made Pantone into the industry standard. And, we hear from Stuart, who tried to break the color monopoly.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

SAM YELLOWHORSE KESLER, HOST:

The day that Stuart Semple decided to become an artist, he was 8 years old. His mom took him to a museum in London, and from across the floor of the gallery, he saw this beacon of yellow.

STUART SEMPLE: You've never seen color like that before.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: The painting was Sunflowers by Van Gogh.

SEMPLE: It just knocked me sideways. And I was literally shaking. And I think it was the colors that were doing it to me.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Those colors are what inspired Stuart to become an artist. These days, he makes giant installation pieces with bright yellow, smiley faces made of steel, or he does these pop art collages with lots of neon colors.

JEFF GUO, HOST:

Stuart often designs his art on the computer, which is why it was a big deal two years ago when all of his colors disappeared.

SEMPLE: One day, I switched my laptop on, and all the colors in the files are black. All the colors are gone.

GUO: And who had taken the colors? A company called Pantone. You see, Pantone owns the color palette that a lot of people use in programs like, say, Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.

SEMPLE: The way to think about Pantone is it's a language. So if I say cat to you, you can picture a cat. So if I say 249 C - and you can open your book and look up 249 C, and I can open my book and look up 249 C. We're talking the same language. We're talking about exactly the same color.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Pantone books and Pantone color palettes are the industry standard for how designers pretty much anywhere talk about color.

GUO: Like, if we wanted to make a bunch of PLANET MONEY frisbees, we would tell the manufacturer, we want those frisbees to be green number 348 C, and it's Pantone that created and owns that entire system of colors.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: But on that day two years ago, when Stuart's designs were all turned black, Pantone had decided that if people wanted to use Pantone colors in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, they'd have to start paying a monthly or annual fee. Until then all the colors in their artwork and their designs and their projects would be gone.

SEMPLE: It's a huge thing. And it's not just me. Like, this is, like, a global problem that is not right.

GUO: Now, Pantone is this giant in the industry, and Stuart is just one artist. But he wasn't just going to sit back and do nothing. Stuart decides...

SEMPLE: I've got to do something about this. This is just wrong.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: He's going to mount a rescue mission.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: He's going to rescue the colors.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sam Yellowhorse Kesler.

GUO: And I'm Jeff Guo. Stuart was going up against the Pantone monopoly. Pantone created the standard for how people talk about color, a standard that, for Pantone, has become incredibly lucrative.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Today on the show, how does an industry standard become the standard? How did Pantone come to control the language of the rainbow? And how did Pantone amass so much power that they could one day turn all the colors black?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: The modern world could not function without standards, a bunch of people or companies deciding, OK, this is what a USB-C plug looks like. Or this is the shape of a light bulb socket. Or this bunch of dots and dashes will be the sign in Morse code for (yelling) SOS.

GUO: (Laughter) But the thing about standards is they only work if everyone is on the same standard, which kind of becomes this chicken or egg question, right? How do you make a standard into a standard? The story of how Pantone became a standard starts with one man about 60 years ago.

RICHARD HERBERT: A nice man but a tough man.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: This is Richard Herbert. He's talking about his dad, Larry, the inventor of the Pantone standard.

HERBERT: He used to always use the saying, it takes a tough man to make a tender chicken. So it takes a tough man to make an accurate color.

GUO: Now, we did reach out to Larry for this episode, but he wasn't available. Richard, though, worked at Pantone for decades. He eventually became the president of the company.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: And Richard tells us that back in the 1960s, his dad, Larry, worked at a printing company, making brochures and signs and posters. And he noticed this issue - it was really hard for people to talk about color. If some client wanted a certain shade of blue for their poster or magazine ad, they would have to actually send a sample of the color.

HERBERT: You know, our famous thing was cut a piece off their tie and send it into the print and say, match this color. And then every time they had to match that color, it would be custom mixing. They had their own ink formula books, and they could get close. But it was very random.

GUO: And not just ties. People would hand Larry the wildest of references. Like, here's a piece of a vase. Can you match that color? Or maybe this leaf from my backyard.

HERBERT: I have heard anecdotally of people bringing in a dog.

GUO: (Laughter).

HERBERT: You know, match my dog, you know?

GUO: I want this brochure to be the color of Fido.

HERBERT: Yeah. Exactly.

GUO: All this made Larry's job pretty chaotic, right? This little scrap of a tie might get faded. It might get lost.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: The dog might get lost.

GUO: Yeah. Now, some printing companies and ink manufacturers had what are called color reference books with catalogs of different colors and how to mix them. But every color book had a different set of shades and used different formulas.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Larry wanted designers to be able to go to any print shop and get the exact same color. He wanted to make a set of shades that everybody could use, a universal language for color, a standard.

GUO: The purpose of a standard, of course, is to help different parts of an industry all work together. Think of like a shipping container. Shipping containers mostly come in a standard size and shape. And now the whole supply chain is designed around those standard-sized shipping containers, from the cargo ships to the cranes to the ports to the trucks.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: And now, a lot of times, standards are created by the government or by a group of companies working together. But people and companies have also famously fought over whose standards would win out. Think, like, VHS versus Betamax.

GUO: But in the case of Pantone, Larry was just one guy. How did he get his standard to succeed? Two things. First, he made a really thoughtful standard. He researched which colors were the most commonly used, and he narrowed the list down to about 500. And for each of those colors, he developed an ink recipe for how to reproduce that color consistently.

HERBERT: There would be a number. Back in those days, it was called PMS for Pantone Matching System. PMS, a number and, underneath, an ink formula.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: But what's even more important than coming up with a good standard is to really go out and sell your standard. And here is where Larry had a clever strategy. He started with the ink manufacturers, but he knew that the big ones weren't going to give him the time of day. So he targeted the smaller ones, the mom-and-pop ink shops.

HERBERT: You know, I think he knew enough that, let me work with the small guys that I'm used to working with that I was buying ink from anyway. And, you know, he knew the community, so it was a better way to start. Low-hanging fruit, you know?

GUO: Pretty soon, Larry gets 20 of those 21 smaller ink manufacturers on board with his Pantone color standard. And from there, it just kind of snowballed 'cause, you see, standards benefit from what are called network effects. The more people in the industry who started to use Pantone's way of talking about color, the more people who wanted to use Pantone's way of talking about color.

HERBERT: Once he got a certain amount of U.S. ink makers on board, then he hopped on the plane. And he started in Europe and met with the ink companies there and did the same thing and got them to sign on and continue to, I guess, onto the Middle East and then to Asia and then back.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: And because Larry was one of the first people to try to standardize this industry, he was quickly able to get everybody around the world to use his system. By 1968, he'd succeeded. He'd turned Pantone into an industry standard.

GUO: And this is when Larry and the Pantone color system faced its biggest test - copycats. Now, if you think about other standards, like, say, the metric system, no one owns the metric system. A lot of standards are open like that. They're free to use. But in Pantone's case, Larry always insisted that his company, Pantone, owned this standard.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: So when he noticed another company selling copycat books, he took them to court. These knockoff Pantone books were called Para-Tone.

HERBERT: They didn't even try to make it look different.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: The lawsuit was about whether Pantone could own the standard it had created, whether it could copyright the colors and codes in the Pantone system.

GUO: Para-Tone's argument - at least one of them - was that nobody can copyright colors. Colors are a natural phenomenon. One company can't own the rainbow.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Pantone, though, said what it made was more like a dictionary or a novel.

HERBERT: You can't copyright a word. But when you organize words in a specific way, it tells a story and a unique story. The same is true with color. You can't copyright a color. But, you know, if you create this arrangement of colors that creates a system, that's protectable, and that's copyrightable.

GUO: And the judge in this lawsuit sided with Pantone. The judge said Pantone was not copyrighting or trying to own the rainbow. They had created a system. They had created a standard.

HERBERT: And that was really just the watershed moment that just said, OK, we have a court-tested copyright on this system, and don't mess with us.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Since that lawsuit in 1968, Pantone has basically had a monopoly on how companies talk about color, a monopoly that has proven to be very lucrative.

GUO: After the break, how Pantone makes money off its standard, and what happens when one person tries to go up against the Pantone monopoly.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: OK. So it has been about 60 years since Larry Herbert first created the Pantone color standard. And let us just show you how important this has become to the day-to-day workings of the real world. We are in an industrial part of Queens, N.Y., walking into what's called a dye house.

CHRISTIAN DRANKWALTER: How's it going?

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Good. Everything's good.

GUO: This is Christian Drankwalter, owner of this place that, you know, dyes fabric for customers like Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Vera Wang - big, big fashion houses.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: And this dye house - imagine an industrial laundromat, what looked like washing machines, agitating clothes back and forth with different colored dyes.

DRANKWALTER: Like, a very bright neon pink.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: One of the machines was overflowing with maybe the pinkest pink I've ever seen in my life. It looked like a Pepto-Bismol waterfall.

DRANKWALTER: My sneakers get ruined. My clothes get ruined, so...

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: You made a bold choice with the white sneakers.

DRANKWALTER: Yeah.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: (Laughter).

DRANKWALTER: Luckily, I own a dye house, so I could just dye my clothes if they get ruined. Yeah.

GUO: So the reason we're here is because for people in the fashion industry, like Christian, Pantone has become invaluable. It lets people quickly take an idea, like, color, and get on the same page.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: So, for example, Christian told us one of his clients, Disney, recently ordered a bunch of felt fabric dyed a specific salmon color, maybe for, like, a piglet costume. Now, Disney could say, just watch a Winnie the Pooh movie and pause it on Piglet and then match that color.

GUO: But what if Christian happens to pause the movie when Piglet is in shadow? Or what if Christian's screen has different color settings? This is where the Pantone standard comes in.

DRANKWALTER: They could just send me an email that says, we want this to match Pantone 15-1626, and I can reference my book, and we're looking at the same exact thing.

GUO: And so these days, almost every brand you can think of talks about themselves in the language that Pantone invented. Take Target's red bull's eye logo. That is Pantone 186.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Netflix's red, though - that's Pantone 1795 C.

GUO: But Kodak red - that is Pantone 485 C.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: And each of these reds refers to a specific code that you can look up in the Pantone books and color palettes.

GUO: Right. You know how, like, there used to be this official kilogram that sat in a vault in Paris, and this was the one kilogram to rule all the kilograms? These Pantone books are like that. They are the definitive authority on what any of these colors look like.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: We wanted to be in the presence of one of these books - to hold it in our hand.

You have a book here.

DRANKWALTER: Yeah. We have several.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Christian grabs a couple of books off a messy shelf.

DRANKWALTER: This one I haven't used in a long time.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Oh, wow.

GUO: These Pantone books are thick binders full of thousands of these little fabric swatches, each the size of a stamp.

DRANKWALTER: These are physical cotton chips. You see? Like, it's the truest to color, and it doesn't become subjective. And this is what I reference to the most.

GUO: These books - they are like seeing that official kilogram in person. But unlike the official kilogram, this book, this color standard, is controlled by a corporation trying to make money. And the main way they make money is by selling these books.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: The books that Christian uses cost $3,000 brand new.

DRANKWALTER: This is even a different book.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Bigger, fancier versions, like the ones that include a set of plastic chips. Those go for $9,000.

DRANKWALTER: They're very expensive. It is a lot to keep having to buy new ones all the time.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: See, it's not enough to just buy a set once. Pantone says the colors will fade over time, and they're always adding new colors, new codes. But Christian says you can't run a color business without the Pantone colors.

GUO: And Pantone - it has expanded its business beyond just physical books and swatches. They also make digital palettes. A lot of designers use those palettes in programs like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. And it's those digital palettes that became the center of the drama that day back in 2022, when artists around the world discovered that their designs had all turned black, like what the artist Stuart Semple experienced at the beginning of the story.

SEMPLE: One day, I switched my laptop on, and all the colors in the files are black. All the colors are gone.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: For years and years, Adobe had been paying Pantone for the right to use Pantone's digital color palettes and its software. But that deal ended in 2022, which is when everybody's Pantone colors in their Adobe files started to go black. So Pantone went directly to users and said, if you want your colors back, you have to pay $15 a month going forward.

GUO: Now, some people blamed Adobe for this. But for Stuart, this was an ugly reminder of just how much power Pantone wielded because it owned the standard, and it could turn it off whenever.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Stuart decides he's going to liberate Pantone's digital color palette.

What do you do?

SEMPLE: Well, here's the funny thing. I - I've got to get this right. I created a color palette of my own that was extremely similar to theirs.

GUO: Why did you have to word that so carefully?

SEMPLE: There's just certain things that could probably get me in trouble.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Yeah. Stuart basically just made a free copy of Pantone's palette. He calls his version Freetone. It's this file that has Pantone's colors and codes. And when you add it as a plug-in to Adobe, suddenly, your colors are back, same as before. Stuart says Freetone was immediately popular. It's been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.

GUO: And Stuart does know that what he's doing is legally iffy. But to him, it's almost like an act of civil disobedience.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Has anyone from Pantone ever reached out to you about this?

SEMPLE: No, it's really weird. I've heard nothing from Pantone at all. No, not one thing.

GUO: Stuart says he'd actually welcome the opportunity to go to court, to stand up there and ask, is it fair for Pantone to hold a monopoly on the language of color?

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: This is the question at the heart of this story. If you look at the standards that are out there in the world, a lot are overseen by a government or a nonprofit organization. For instance, a nonprofit manages the standard for USB plugs. The U.S. government created the original standard for how color TV was broadcast over the air.

GUO: Has any of this ever made you think, whoa, maybe we should just not use Pantone anymore? Maybe we should, you know, get together and come up with something like the standard for color that's open, that's free, that is, you know, owned by all of us and not just one company.

SEMPLE: Yeah. I mean, that's a beautiful idea, and it's certainly something I've entertained. But to produce something like that, you need two things. You need mass adoption. It's no good having a language if you're the only person in the world who speaks it. And also, the cost and the infrastructure of implementing something like that is massive. I can't create a whole new color standard and get everyone in the world to use it.

GUO: The whole Pantone saga - it raises a lot of questions about the economics of standards. On one side, standards are incredibly valuable. They create efficiency and consistency. When Pantone invented this common language for color, there was no longer a need to cut up ties or walk Fido to the print shop. And creating that standard took a lot of work. It required research, testing, selling it to countries around the world. All that labor is what allowed Pantone to make an entire industry out of color.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: But on the other hand, the way that standards work is that they are monopolies. They kind of have to be. A standard is only valuable when everybody uses it. But things can get messy when a single company like Pantone controls that standard.

GUO: When we spoke with Richard Herbert, the former president of Pantone and the son of the man who created the Pantone color system, we did ask him what he thought about this criticism that Pantone wields its monopoly power in an unfair way.

HERBERT: The reality is you don't have to use Pantone. You could use whatever system works the best. And, you know, we talk about a standard. Pantone became a de facto standard 'cause it worked the best.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: But it's also true that when everybody else in your industry adopts a standard like Pantone, you kind of have to use that standard, too.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: By the way, we did reach out to Adobe for this story. Adobe eventually made it possible for those blacked-out files to show up in color again. But they're not official Pantone colors.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: Now, Pantone is not just the owner of this color standard. They also have all these side hustles. They work with big brands to create custom colors. Like, for the "Minions" movie, Pantone created Minion yellow.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Yeah. And actually, when we began reporting the story, I actually had this dream for PLANET MONEY to have one of those colors, for PLANET MONEY to have our own spot on the Pantone system - maybe even right next to the Minions.

GUO: (Laughter) Right where we belong.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Yeah, so we asked Pantone, and after three months, there's still been no word. So the other day, we asked someone else who knows a thing or two about colors.

We were wondering if you might consider making us a color.

SEMPLE: I'd love to make you a color. It would be really fun. Yeah, of course.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Oh, OK.

GUO: Amazing.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Oh, great. OK, awesome.

GUO: Stuart isn't just the creator of that digital color palette Freetone. He also has a whole line of paints and pigments.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: So we're working with Stuart to get a PLANET MONEY color made. The question is now, what color?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1, BYLINE: Aren't we in, like, a solid green territory?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2, BYLINE: The planet is mostly blue ocean.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3, BYLINE: Is it gold? I'm thinking gold.

YELLOWHORSE KESLER: Listeners, send us your ideas. There's a link to a survey in the show notes.

KENNY MALONE, BYLINE: Gray? Shall we pick gray? Is gray a good color?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4, BYLINE: Kenny, I should say, is color blind. That might be relevant.

MALONE: Yeah. I don't know why I'm in this meeting.

I want this brochure to be the color of Fido.
Yeah, exactly.

Think like VHS versus Betamax.
But in the case of Pantone, Larry was just one guy.
How did he get a standard to succeed?
Two things.
First, he made a really thoughtful standard.
He researched which colors were the most commonly used and he narrowed
the list down to about 500.
And for each of those colors, he developed an ink recipe for how to
reproduce that color consistently.
There would be a number.
Back in those days, it was called PMS for Pantone Matching System.
PMS a number and underneath an ink formula.
But what's even more important than coming up with a good standard is to
really go out and sell your standard.
And here is where Larry had a clever strategy.
He started with the ink manufacturers, but he knew that the big ones
weren't going to give him the time of day.
So he targeted the smaller ones, the mom and pop ink shops.
You know, I think he knew enough that let me work with the small guys
that I'm used to working with, that I was buying ink from anyway.
And, you know, he knew the community.
So it was a better way to start.
Low hanging fruit, you know.
Pretty soon, Larry gets 20 of those 21 smaller ink manufacturers
on board with his Pantone color standard.
And from there, it just kind of snowballed.
Because, you see, standards benefit from what are called network effects.
The more people in the industry who started to use Pantone's way of talking
about color, the more people who wanted to use Pantone's way of talking about color.
Once he got a certain amount of U.S. ink makers on board,
then he hopped on the plane and he started in Europe and met with the ink
companies there and did the same thing and got them to sign on and
continued, I guess, on to the Middle East and then to Asia and then back.
And because Larry was one of the first people to try to standardize this
He was quickly able to get everybody around the world to use his system.
By 1968, he'd succeeded.
He'd turned Pantone into an industry standard.
And this is when Larry and the Pantone color system faced its biggest test,
copycats.
Now, if you think about other standards, like, say, the metric system,
no one owns the metric system.
A lot of standards are open like that.
They're free to use.
But in Pantone's case, Larry always insisted that his company, Pantone,
owned this standard.
So when he noticed another company selling copycat books,
he took them to court.
These knockoff Pantone books were called Paratone.
They didn't even try to make it look different.
The lawsuit was about whether Pantone could own the standard it had created,
whether it could copyright the colors and codes in the Pantone system.
Paratone's argument, at least one of them,
was that nobody can copyright colors.
Colors are a natural phenomenon.
One company can't own the rainbow.
Pantone, though, said what it made was more like a dictionary or a novel.
You can't copyright a word.
But when you organize words in a specific way,
it tells a story and a unique story.
The same is true with color.
You can't copyright a color.
But if you create this arrangement of colors that creates a system,
that's protectable and that's copyrightable.
And the judge in this lawsuit sided with Pantone.
The judge said Pantone was not copywriting or trying to own the rainbow.
They had created a system.
They had created a standard.
And that was really just the watershed moment that just said,
OK, we have a court-tested copyright on this system,
and don't mess with us.
Since that lawsuit in 1968, Pantone has basically
had a monopoly on how companies talk about color,
a monopoly that has proven to be very lucrative.
After the break, how Pantone makes money off its standard.
And what happens when one person tries to go up against the Pantone monopoly?
Waylon, how much do you think it would cost to buy one of those big digital

In this economy?
I mean, you're probably right.
But this question is the exact kind of thing
that we find answers to on our show.
We take one big economic idea, make it understandable,
and, you know, even fun.
That's the indicator from Planet Money and NPR.

Hey, Darian Woods here.
The company Nvidia dominates the AI chip market.
Its success comes from designing computer chips
and a software ecosystem.
Thousands of people over decades there
have been building middleware to enable AI developers
to use the hardware.
And that is all proprietary to Nvidia.
In our latest bonus episode, it's my extended conversation
with David Rosenthal, the co-host of The Acquired podcast.
We talk about Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang,
and how the company went from video game graphics cards
to AI juggernaut.

OK, so it has been about 60 years
since Larry Herbert first created
the Pantone color standard.
And let us just show you how important this has become
to the day-to-day workings of the real world.
We are in an industrial part of Queens, New York,
walking into what's called a dye house.
How's it going?
Good, everything is good.
This is Christian Drankwalter,
owner of this place that dyes fabric
for customers like Calvin Klein,
Marc Jacobs, Vera Wang, big, big fashion houses.
In this dye house, imagine an industrial laundromat
with what looks like washing machines
agitating clothes back and forth
with different colored dyes.
Like a very bright neon pink.
One of the machines was overflowing
with maybe the pinkest pink I've ever seen in my life.
It looked like a heptabismal watermark.
My sneakers get ruined, my clothes get ruined.
You made a bold choice with the white.
Yeah, luckily I own a dye house
so I could just dye my clothes if they get ruined.
So the reason we're here is because
for people in the fashion industry, like Christian,
Pantone has become invaluable.
It lets people quickly take an idea like color
and get on the same page.
So for example, Christian told us
one of his clients, Disney,
recently ordered a bunch of felt fabric
dyed a specific salmon color,
maybe for like a piglet costume.
Now Disney could say, just watch a Winnie the Pooh movie
and pause it on Piglet and then match that color.
But what if Christian happens to pause the movie
when Piglet is in shadow?
Or what if Christian's screen has different color settings?
This is where the Pantone standard comes in.
And they could just send me an email that says,
we want this to match Pantone 15-1626
and I can reference my book
and we're looking at the same exact thing.
And so these days, almost every brand you can think of
talks about themselves in the language
that Pantone invented.
Take Target's red bullseye logo.
That is Pantone 186.
Netflix's red though, that's Pantone 1795C.
But Kodak red, that is Pantone 485C.
And each of these reds refers to a specific code
that you can look up in the Pantone books
and color palettes.
Right, you know how like there used to be
this official kilogram that sat in a vault in Paris
and this was the one kilogram to rule all the kilograms?
These Pantone books are like that.
They are the definitive authority
on what any of these colors look like.
We wanted to be in the presence of one of these books,
to hold it in our hand.
You have a book here.
Yeah, we have several.
Christian grabs a couple books off a messy shelf.
This one I haven't used in a long time.
Oh wow.
These Pantone books are thick binders
full of thousands of these little fabric swatches,
each the size of a stamp.
These are physical cotton chips.
You see like, it's the truest to color
and doesn't become subjective
and this is what I reference to the most.
These books, they are like seeing
that official kilogram in person.
But unlike the official kilogram,
this book, this color standard
is controlled by a corporation trying to make money.
And the main way they make money
is by selling these books.
The books that Christian uses cost $3,000 brand new.
This is even a different book.
Bigger, fancier versions
like the ones that include a set of plastic chips,
those go for $9,000.
They're very expensive and it is a lot
to keep having to buy new ones all the time.
See, it's not enough to just buy a set once.
Pantone says the colors will fade over time
and they're always adding new colors, new codes.
But Christian says you can't run a color business
without the Pantone colors.
And Pantone, it has expanded its business
beyond just physical books and swatches.
They also make digital palettes.
A lot of designers use those palettes
in programs like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.
And it's those digital palettes
that became the center of the drama that day back in 2022
when artists around the world discovered
that their designs had all turned black.
Like what the artist Stuart Semple experienced
at the beginning of the story.
One day I switched my laptop on
and all the colors in the files are black.
All the colors are gone.
For years and years, Adobe had been paying Pantone
for the right to use Pantone's digital color palettes
in its software.
But that deal ended in 2022,
which is when everybody's Pantone colors
and their Adobe files started to go black.
So Pantone went directly to users and said,
if you want your colors back,
you have to pay $15 a month going forward.
Now, some people blamed Adobe for this,
but for Stuart, this was an ugly reminder
of just how much power Pantone wielded
because it owned the standard
and it could turn it off whenever.
Stuart decides he's going to liberate
Pantone's digital color palette.
What do you do?
Well, here's the funny thing.
I go get this right.
I created a color palette of my own
that was extremely similar to theirs.
Uh-huh.
Why did you have to word that so carefully?
There's just certain things
that could probably get me in trouble.
Yeah, Stuart basically just made a free copy
of Pantone's palette.
He calls his version Freetone.
It's this file that has Pantone's colors and codes.
And when you add it as a plugin to Adobe,
suddenly your colors are back, same as before.
Stuart says Freetone was immediately popular.
It's been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.
And Stuart does know that what he's doing is legally iffy,
but to him, it's almost like an act of civil disobedience.
Has anyone from Pantone ever reached out
to you about this?
No, it's really weird.
I've heard nothing from Pantone at all.
Not one thing.
Stuart says he'd actually welcome the opportunity
to go to court, to stand up there and ask,
is it fair for Pantone to hold a monopoly
on the language of color?
This is the question at the heart of this story.
If you look at the standards that are out there
in the world, a lot are overseen by a government
or a nonprofit organization.
For instance, a nonprofit manages the standard
for USB plugs.
The US government created the original standard
for how color TV was broadcast over the air.
Has any of this ever made you think,
well, maybe we should just not use Pantone anymore.
Maybe we should, you know, get together
and come up with something at the standard for color
that's open, that's free, that is, you know,
owned by all of us and not just one company.
Yeah, I mean, that's a beautiful idea
and it's certainly something I've entertained.
But to produce something like that,
you need two things.
You need mass adoption.
It's no good having a language
if you're the only person in the world who speaks it.
And also the cost and the infrastructure
of implementing something like that is massive.
I can't create a whole new color standard
and get everyone in the world to use it.
The whole Pantone saga, it raises a lot of questions
about the economics of standards.
On one side, standards are incredibly valuable.
They create efficiency and consistency.
When Pantone invented this common language for color,
there was no longer need to cut up ties
or walk Fido to the print shop.
And creating that standard took a lot of work.
It required research, testing, selling it
to countries around the world.
All that labor is what allowed Pantone
to make an entire industry out of color.
But on the other hand, the way that standards work
is that they are monopolies.
They kind of have to be.
A standard is only valuable when everybody uses it.
But things can get messy when a single company
like Pantone controls that standard.
When we spoke with Richard Herbert,
the former president of Pantone
and the son of the man
who created the Pantone color system,
we did ask him what he thought about this criticism
that Pantone wields its monopoly power in an unfair way.
The reality is, is you don't have to use Pantone.
You could use whatever system works the best.
And, you know, we talk about a standard.
Pantone became a de facto standard
because it worked the best.
But it's also true that when everybody else
in your industry adopts a standard like Pantone,
you kind of have to use that standard too.
By the way, we did reach out to Adobe for the story.
Adobe eventually made it possible
for those blacked out files to show up in color again.
But they're not official Pantone colors.
Now Pantone is not just the owner of this color standard.
They also have all these side hustles.
They work with big brands to create custom colors.
Like for the Minions movie,
Pantone created Minion Yellow.
Yeah, and actually when we began reporting the story,
I actually had this dream for Planet Money
to have one of those colors.
For Planet Money to have our own spot
on the Pantone system.
Maybe even right next to the Minions.
Right where we belong.
Yeah, so we asked Pantone
and after three months, there's still been no word.
So the other day, we asked someone else
who knows a thing or two about colors.
We were wondering if you might consider
making us a color.
Well, I'd love to make you a color.
It'd be really fun.
Yeah, of course.
Amazing.
Oh great, okay, awesome.
Stuart isn't just the creator
of that digital color palette Freetone.
He also has a whole line of paints and pigments.
So we're working with Stuart
to get a Planet Money color made.
The question is now, what color?
Like a solid green territory?
The planet is mostly blue ocean.
Is it gold?
I'm thinking gold.
Listeners, send us your ideas.
There's a link to a survey in the show notes.
Gray, should we pick gray?
Is gray a good color?
Kenny, I should say is color blind.
That might be relevant.
Yeah, I don't know why I'm in this meeting.
