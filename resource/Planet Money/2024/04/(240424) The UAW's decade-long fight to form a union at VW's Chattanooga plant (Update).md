Union membership in the U.S. has been declining for decades. But, in 2022, support for unions among Americans was the highest it's been in decades. This dissonance is due, in part, to the difficulties of one important phase in the life cycle of a union: setting up a union in the first place. One place where that has been particularly clear is at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Back in 2008, Volkswagen announced that they would be setting up production in the United States after a 20-year absence. They planned to build a new auto manufacturing plant in Chattanooga.

Volkswagen has plants all over the world, all of which have some kind of worker representation, and the company said that it wanted that for Chattanooga too. So, the United Auto Workers, the union that traditionally represents auto workers, thought they would be able to successfully unionize this plant.

They were wrong.

In this episode, we tell the story of the UAW's 10-year fight to unionize the Chattanooga plant. And, what other unions can learn from how badly that fight went for labor.

This episode was hosted by Amanda Aronczyk and Nick Fountain. It was produced by Willa Rubin. It was engineered by Josephine Nyounai, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and edited by Keith Romer. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer.

AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:

That is where we left it back in October 2023. Now, as we know, things did, in the end, go well for the union, so what changed? What changed to flip so many votes at the Chattanooga plant? To answer that, we called up professor Stephen Silvia again.

STEPHEN SILVIA: If you want to start at what made things different, it was the election of Shawn Fain.

ARONCZYK: Shawn Fain became president of the United Auto Workers in March of 2023. And late last year, he led the UAW on strike nationally and won huge victories against the big three automakers. That's General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which used to be Chrysler.

SILVIA: Many people looking at it were in some ways skeptical at first, but the thing that was amazing is the way that the UAW was very clever in selecting tactics.

ARONCZYK: Traditionally, the UAW would target just one of the big three car companies at a time. But Shawn Fain threw out that old playbook, and the UAW decided to hold strikes at all big three companies at the same time - but not at every single plant. They picked strategic plants so when they shut one of these down, it meant that another plant downstream wouldn't be getting what they needed to do their jobs. So the whole thing was very disruptive to production, and it also let a lot more workers stay on the job, collecting paychecks.

SILVIA: By having a strike that would have a relatively small number of employees involved, you could shut down a significant amount of production. And they were very successful.

ARONCZYK: And as the workers in the Chattanooga plant watched all of this, another thing Stephen says that made Shawn Fain and the UAW seem more attractive was transparency. Workers got to watch the UAW negotiate in real time, often with livestreaming updates on the negotiations. Like, there's this one video where Shawn Fain gives his response to a Stellantis offer.

SHAWN FAIN: Everything they're looking for in this document is about concessions. So I'll tell you what I want to do with their proposal. I'm going to file it in its proper place because that's where it belongs, the trash, because that's what it is.

STEVE COCHRAN: Shawn is different because he is so transparent and honest with everyone. That's the thing that we like best about it.

ARONCZYK: This is Steve Cochran again, does maintenance for the Volkswagen factory in Tennessee. He's a union organizer. When I called him up, he was in his car driving home from work. Steve says that Shawn's transparency tactics were able to change some people's perceptions of unions in the South.

COCHRAN: Having all that done in the public eye was very, very, very eye-opening, very educational for a lot of people everywhere.

ARONCZYK: When we last left Steve, the union had just lost their third election. He and the other union organizers were getting ready to regroup. Since then, there's been one other big change, this time from the Volkswagen side.

COCHRAN: The company decided to stay neutral this time. You know, they didn't put out a big anti-union campaign. They didn't put out fear tactics to us. They said, hey, it's going to be your decision. Y'all decision is what it is, and we'll stay as neutral as possible. And they did.

ARONCZYK: Steve says this is because the brass at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany told the management at the Chattanooga factory that, you will not run an anti-union campaign. Because of that, the stalling tactics that the company had used last time did not come into play. So Steve Cochran said it was much easier to make his case this time, even in conservative Tennessee, which is a right-to-work state where unions are very politicized. They're considered aligned with the Democratic Party and are generally pretty unpopular.

COCHRAN: You have to understand, though, there's a lot of Republican voting people in Chattanooga, a lot of them. We're never going to tell anybody how they should or shouldn't vote. That'll never happen. But everybody put that aside. They put all that aside - said, we got to do it ourselves.

ARONCZYK: And then after all of those campaigns - four in the past dozen or so years - last week, workers at Steve Cochran's factory voted overwhelmingly to form a union.

COCHRAN: We had a watch party at the union office. And after we were there and stuff, there was some good fireworks going off and some people drinking a little bit of alcohol and stuff. Nothing got out of hand.

ARONCZYK: Steve, how did it feel to walk into work on the first day after the vote?

COCHRAN: It is a lot better feeling than walking in after a loss. I know that. I was very proud at the outcome and very - smiling and stuff, but I didn't gloat.

ARONCZYK: Steve said there were a couple of people who might have cheered a little, maybe a few handshakes, some high-fives. But mostly, people just got back to work side-by-side with their colleagues regardless of how they voted.

COCHRAN: We've been at this thing for 12 long years. And it's just - it's a great feeling now, you know? But honestly, people can disagree about something. We're still going to do our job, though, and build the best quality cars we can. That shows you the true grit.

ARONCZYK: And Steve's hoping that maybe this is the start of a new era of unionizing in the South.

COCHRAN: We're one of the first dominoes, you know? So if our domino knocks their domino and the next dominoes, this may be a huge, huge push throughout all of the automotive industry in the South.

ARONCZYK: The next domino Steve hopes will fall are the Mercedes factory in Vance, Ala., a Toyota engine plant in Missouri, a Hyundai plant in Alabama, and a plant that Volkswagen is currently building in South Carolina.

Quick note we mentioned Amazon in the show Amazon is a sponsor of NPR and they pay to distribute some of our content
This is planet money from NPR
Last week unions got a big win
Workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee voted to unionize by a lot
2628 votes for
985 against and this is a result that even less than a year ago
Kind of felt like a long shot, which I feel comfortable saying because we did a whole episode on the plant in Chattanooga
Today we are revisiting that episode
It ran originally in October 2023 and it's about why it has been so hard to unionize in places like Tennessee
Why it wasn't happening and then at the end we will have an update about what changed last week and how this win
Is potentially just the first domino to fall it all starts with the story of a party back in May 2011
hundreds of people dressed business casual show up has more dervs and
Witnessed the grand opening of a brand new 2 million square foot auto manufacturing plant
It's like a fun party and some of the guests are cars
The crowd is invited to an enormous room with rows and rows of chairs facing a stage
The overhead lights dim and the video screens flash the volkswagen logo
Thus auto is finally back in the states the future for Volkswagen begins
here in Chattanooga
I
Gotta say it's such a weird announcement. Yeah, it kind of gets weirder as part of the opening ceremonies
There's an interpretive dance
It's weirder as part of the opening ceremonies
There's an interpretive dance by people in white bodysuits and it kind of appears like they're assembling a Volkswagen
Afterwards there is a more just straight-ahead press conference, right?
Tennessee senator Bob Corker is there and he's
emotional the greatest moment in my public career was receiving the call from the Volkswagen group that they were coming to
Chattanooga and I want to thank all of you for making that decision
The opening of this Volkswagen manufacturing plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee was the culmination of years of negotiation
The company had shut down its only American plant back in the 1980s
And this was their comeback and the competition to win Volkswagen's new plant was fierce around that time
Southern states were desperate to lure in big companies
South Carolina gave BMW more than a hundred thirty million dollars in incentives and Alabama gave Mercedes more than 250 million worth of
Incentives to build a plant there and Tennessee they wanted in they wanted a car plant to Stephen Sylvia professor of international relations at American
University, he says the state did everything they could to woo
Volkswagen well Bob Corker works very closely with the state establishment and
they get a range of
Subsidies and other benefits they offer Volkswagen. They offer tax abatements. They offer them land
They offer them
Educational facilities when you add it all up it comes to more than
570 million dollars in aid tax breaks and incentives right in at the time a typical auto plant cost about a billion dollars
So that is how does auto came back to the states and set up in Tennessee now
Just to remind you of what this moment was like the plant opens as the country is still recovering from the financial crisis
For locals, this is like this one shiny star in a long dark night when the Volkswagen plant starts hiring
85,000 people apply for just 2,000 jobs
2,000 new jobs making cars and of course, this is interesting not just to locals but also to unions
Specifically the United Auto Workers, you know the union that traditionally represents people who work in car manufacturing and currently has members
They want these to be union jobs, right because the way the UAW sees it
Chattanooga is one place where they maybe can regain some ground
The UAW used to represent a majority of auto workers in the US back in 1979
They had more than one and a half million members by the time this plant opened that number had fallen to below
400,000 and Stephen says that decline is in part because of right-to-work laws that make it hard to form and fund a union
But it's also because a bunch of foreign-owned car companies came into the US and set up non-union factories
the UAW has had a
frustrating time for
Almost 20 years trying to organize
foreign-owned car plants and failing but the arrival of Volkswagen in the south for the UAW this seems different
potentially good the UAW leadership saw
Volkswagen as their best opportunity their best opportunity for good reason because
Volkswagen has plants all over the world and they all have some kind of worker representation
Plus the company had actually come out and said that they wanted that in Chattanooga at their new plant
So management was open to a union the UAW definitely wanted a union now
It's just a matter of convincing the workers. Yeah, you'll want a union, too
What could go wrong?
Hello, welcome to Planet Money. I'm Amanda Aronchik and I'm Nick Fountain
Union membership in the US has been declining for decades in part because of how difficult this one phase in the lifecycle of any
Union has become be setting up of that union and if you want a case study in just how many ways things can go
Wrong. Well, look no further than Chattanooga
Today on the show we look at three attempts over ten years to establish a union at this one car plant in Tennessee
And what these attempts tell us about why union campaigns live or die
Hey, it's Aisha Roscoe from NPR's up first podcast
I'm one of thousands of NPR network voices coming to you from over 200 local newsrooms across the country
We bring all Americans closer together
Through free and independent journalism music politics culture and so much more the NPR network
What you hear changes everything learn more at NPR org slash network
One of the 2000 workers hired by Volkswagen at their new plant in Chattanooga is Steve Cochran
I was there the first day the first car was produced. So I've been there since the groundbreaking pretty much
Steve's job is to maintain the equipment when something breaks. He's one of the people they call to fix it
He used to work at Goodyear tire factory. His entire career has been working in factories, right?
And he says when you work at one of these places you got to stay sharp
I mean, even though there's a lot of automation in there
There's still a lot of hands on the car screwing in bolts and stuff
So I still got all ten toes and ten fingers and there's a lot of people out there that don't my age
You know because they get them hung up in something or do something dumb
I like to go home with all my with all my digits and all the same way I come in, you know
So I get that I get that I feel like that's a reasonable thing to expect from work
Oh, yeah
Now Steve had been in a union before when he'd worked for Goodyear
So when he heard that Volkswagen was supportive of unions, he was like, yeah, great
It's what I want to like if you get a job at General Motors Ford or any of the places like that
It's life-changing that changes your life for years. It changes everything that you ever do
That should be the same thing when you get a job at Volkswagen
Volkswagen had set starting wages at the plant at fourteen dollars and fifty cents an hour
Which was pretty decent for Chattanooga, but Steve is pretty sure that if they had a union
They'd probably get higher wages better benefits more time off
Not long after the plant opens the United Auto Workers hold their first meeting in Chattanooga
Steve shows up and he's into it pretty quickly. He decides that not only does he want a union
He wants to be a union organizer
So he starts campaigning for the UAW. He's making flyers. He's talking to people doing social media
He's trying to convince his co-workers. We need a union
We need the UAW now to establish a local chapter that is able to sit down and negotiate with Volkswagen
They have to prove that a majority of workers actually want a union. Here is how that happens
Union officials go around with
Authorization cards, this is professor Stephen Sylvia again, so they're not membership cards, but they're
authorization cards what they say on them is I
Authorize the UAW to be my
representative in
Collective bargaining right the first step to getting a union at the plant is getting signed cards from a majority of the workers
Which the UAW says they got but here's where things go a little sideways
Remember how Volkswagen ended up in Tennessee that
570 million dollars worth of incentives
Yeah, many of those politicians behind those incentives do not want the UAW at this plant
They do not want the UAW in Chattanooga. They do not want the UAW on a boat
They do not want it with a goat. They do not want the UAW anywhere near anything
Right the way they figured a union at the plant could lead to contagion
Next thing you know all the companies in Chattanooga would end up unionized that would be expensive for business
So Volkswagen trying to be pro-labor, but also trying to keep things, you know
Kind of chill with the Republicans running the state
They are stuck in this mushy middle and they do this kind of weird thing
They reject the cards don't recognize the union, but at the same time they still insist
They do want a union
So the UAW decides to try the next option for setting up a union with an election
Which to Volkswagen seems more acceptable an election is called
There's a week and a half of official campaigning where the UAW makes their case and people opposed to the union make theirs
And then there's gonna be a secret vote both sides campaign everywhere
There are billboards TV ads radio ads testimonials a lot of people who don't work at the plant
Also get into the mix like Maury nicely
He's a lawyer who works for an anti-union group called Southern momentum
This is part of a presentation that Maury gave to workers to convince them not to vote for the UAW and in this
Moment in the presentation. He's pointing to a pyramid which is on the screen
I
Spoke with Maury and according to him
he was brought into this campaign by some Volkswagen workers who did not want a union at the plant if you want to think of
Southern momentum think of it as it's basically a loudspeaker for these
employees who are concerned about the UAW who
Beyond Southern momentum didn't have a voice
Southern momentum was partly funded by donations from members
But Maury also acknowledges that money came from people who didn't work at the plant local businesses and people who really didn't want the UAW
To come to Chattanooga another person who really didn't want the UAW to come to Chattanooga
Senator Bob Corker one of the politicians who offered Volkswagen that
570 million dollars plus in incentives and said that the plant opening was the greatest moment in his public career
Well right before the big vote
He shows up in a news segment pointing out how dangerous and radical the union leaders are the officers a month ago talking about fighting
combat and all of those kind of things if that's the environment you want UAW certainly is the people for you to chew or the
People to choose then on the first day of voting. He delivers a shocker
He says he has it on good authority that if workers reject the union
Volkswagen would commit to expanding its operation and build its new SUV right there in Chattanooga
After three days of voting, it's finally time to tally up the votes and see who's won for the Union
626 votes against it
712 it's decided there will be no union at the plant in Chattanooga and
Tomori from Southern Momentum
Bob Corker and a bunch of local politicians weighing in like this on the union election that totally made sense
These were Tennessee politicians. These were Chattanooga politicians
These were citizens saying this is not the best thing for our state and that's exactly what those people should be doing
But for maintenance worker Steve Cochran the senator had gone too far
I'd say he was probably one of the biggest deciding factors that in the media ran with it
You know
They pushed it everywhere on the news ready on everything to work to Steve
The senator had intimidated the workers and he thinks some of them might have changed their votes
Oh some people did out of a fear thing
I ain't gonna say they believed him, but they said, you know, what if you know, what you know?
What if what if Bob Corker is right? What if Volkswagen sets up a new plant elsewhere?
What if they cut our jobs? What if what if what if so that was union campaign number one
Doomed Steve would say by a politician putting his finger on the scales and maybe that is the takeaway from this first campaign
sometimes big powerful people
Interfere with union drives and change the outcome the past bunch of years leaders at Amazon and Boeing have gotten in trouble for this
threatening dire consequences if their workers unionize
For workers sometimes those threats can overshadow the potential upsides of joining a union like how much more vacation
They might get or more pay which brings us to chapter two the micro unit
After the failure of the 2014 campaign in Chattanooga the UAW decides that they should try again and quickly
We gotta do something different. So Steve and some of his fellow workers come up with a new plan
They decide instead of trying to organize the whole plant. What if they start a
Micro unit, you know a small group that would get to bargain directly with management in this case
It would be just for the skilled workers
So not like workers on the line, but electricians and machinists those kind of jobs when there's 150 of you
You know, you're like, you know about all of them, you know
So me you kind of talk to each other stuff and know how things are gonna shake out
Steve thinks a bunch of these skilled workers are going to vote for a micro unit
Many of them have been in unions before and they supported the UAW in the first campaign
And the plan is if they win then they can scale up and unionize the whole plan
The process plays out kind of like it did the last time Steve and the other organizers try to get people to sign
Authorization cards Volkswagen again rejects those cards again
There's some campaigning then an election and this time the UAW wins
We won by 68 percent. You actually did better than that Steve
71% of workers voted for the micro unit
This is a big deal all of these foreign-owned car companies BMW Mercedes Nissan
They'd been setting up plants in the south and none of them had unions now at this point
Volkswagen's management's like wait a second
We're not really into this whole micro unit thing because we do want some kind of worker representation
But it needs to represent all the workers not a fraction of them
We can't negotiate with just some of you that's verboten
Now this is when Stephen the professor says that Volkswagen's attitude towards the union
Hardens and so what happens is they go to fight it. So they hire Ler Mendelsohn, which is a very well-known
Union busting law firm and then they learn about the union avoidance playbook
This is where it's injected into the Volkswagen bloodstream. Once it's there
It just takes and they just run with it
We should mention that we reached out to Volkswagen for this story and they declined to comment
So now instead of the fight happening with ads and billboards and flyers, it's gonna happen with lawyers
Lots of lawyers Volkswagen and the UAW asked the National Labor Relations Board to weigh in on the dispute
They're the federal agency that oversees union elections and for a peek into how that agency works. We called up Wilma Liebman
She's a former chair of the Labor Board and also a former Planet Money guest
By the way, I came here about a couple months ago to do it an interview for a different Planet Money episode
Wilma knows a lot about labor unions. That's why we call her
She's also worked for the UAW as a consultant and as one of their ethics officers
Wilma says that the UAW went to the board to try to get Volkswagen to recognize the micro unit and Volkswagen
They refused and here's where it gets interesting and albeit kind of wonky way
A lot of times when this kind of thing happens Wilma says companies will actually
Weaponize the whole labor board process and use it to gum things up. I think some employers
Slow walk it so they make it look like they're engaging in good faith bargaining
But if they really are determined to avoid
Unionization and having to bargain with the union there are different ways that the whole process can be slowed down
Wilma says that's what happened here. Generally the Labor Board has permitted these micro units
But Volkswagen argued that grouping those skilled workers together that did not qualify
Maintenance workers like Steve work with everyone in the plant. They weren't really what's known as a community of interest
They weren't a self-contained group the UAW
Of course argues that this micro unit that they're trying to set up is a community of interest
Volkswagen's like nope, so back and forth hearing this appealing that
Volkswagen drags this whole thing out as long as they can which Wilma says is perfectly legal
There's no real penalty for employers using all these kinds of delaying strategies
There's no fines. There's no damages to speak of it doesn't have much in the way of teeth
Despite all of that around the end of 2016
It's finally starting to look like Volkswagen is running out of things to appeal
And the UAW might get their micro unit
but then big plot twist a new president is elected Donald Trump you may remember him and
The political orientation of the Labor Board completely changes. Yeah, so this agency is famous for
What's typically called flip-flopping every time the White House changes a more formal expression is policy oscillation
I too have been accused of policy oscillation by my family
It happens to the best of us
So here is what happens a new chair is appointed by the president and now the board is like
You know what we need to look at how we define community of interest again
Tighten up those rules for forming a micro unit. All of a sudden the UAW is back at square one
Wilma says the Labor Board can be
Annoyingly inconsistent over time that the rules are always changing. I think the reasons for that are pretty obvious
It's you know, the labor and capital have deep divides
and the labor law and the role of unions in the US have always been subject to very
deeply held and divided views
The UAW and Volkswagen continue to fight over the micro unit thing in the background for years
Kind of gets stuck in a stalemate. So the takeaway from the second failed union drive in Chattanooga
Timing really matters under some administrations
The NLRB seems to take the side of management like what happened to the UAW in Chattanooga and under others
The NLRB is just way more union friendly
Like how they had a bunch of rulings in favor of the new union at Starbucks and for some grad students who have
Organized around the country just kind of depends on who's in charge. Meanwhile Steve and his buddies. They still want a union
Coming up after the break, they take their fight to the factory floor
Try a little spontaneous protest
By 2018 the plant has been open for seven years
Steve and the other union supporters have been trying to get a union set up pretty much the whole time
But this conflict has sort of been a slow burn
Yeah, they never really had a big dramatic type moment that you see in a union movie
But then a week and a half before Christmas 2018 that moment happens and it basically launches the union's third campaign
It happens when the company changes this one policy
So we have a shutdown every Christmas and every summer, you know for putting new equipment in whatever it is
It's called winter shutdown and they they pay us for that week
The shutdown was so that they could change up the assembly lines so they could start making their new SUV
This time it was going to take even longer than the week. They usually needed three extra days
Normally how this would work is that workers would have the option to just not get paid for those days
But this time management makes an announcement and says hey everybody for those three extra days
You're gonna have to use your paid time off
We were just like, you know, really?
People like I don't I ain't doing that
They didn't like it. So at that moment
There are a bunch of people working on the floor of the plant and they're all looking at the plant
At that moment there are a bunch of people working on the floor of the plant and they're all looking at each other
over these half assembled cars muttering to each other about
management taking away three of their already limited paid days off
For a lot of the workers that's three out of just ten days that they get each year
If y'all make us use all of it up then when are we gonna have to take time off to be our families
be sick, take our kids to the doctor, you know, so it's kind of like, you know, that doesn't work for me
And meanwhile the workers know that the people who made this new policy
are sitting just upstairs up in their glass walled offices
You know this one guy said, man, what can we do?
You know, I'm gonna walk a bird during our break time, so I'll go bird with you
By break time the number of angry people has grown
About 50 of us marched upstairs and now we're not gonna do this
At first management kind of digs in, but the workers, they dig in too
Yeah, because when break time ends, they don't go back to the floor
Production just stops
They could start the line back up because there's so many people missing from the line
Steve says he could see on the managers' faces that their little protest, it was working
So the workers and the managers are in this standoff
The cars on the plant floor are not being assembled
Finally the managers say, okay, they'll think about it
By the end of the day, they're like, fine, you don't have to use your paid days off
When that happened that actually changed the way they handled that stuff for a little while
But it didn't stick. Steve says that not too long after, they actually changed the policy back
And Steve, he used this moment, he told his colleagues
If they had a union, this flip-flopping by management around policies, it would not be happening
I try to explain to people if we had had a contract and that stuff was written in a contract
Then we wouldn't have to do that no more
All that stuff is just not left up to somebody's, this is how I feel about it today
In the months after this mini-protest, Steve and the other union supporters
Are actively trying to drum up support for another election
But you know what was also happening around this time?
The FBI has raided the home of United Auto Workers Union President Gary Jones
This is part of a probe regarding alleged corruption within the U.S. auto industry
Yeah, the whole time they're campaigning, this corruption scandal at the UAW is all over the news
Again, in addition to the pro-union side, there's a campaign against the union
And they are making a very big deal of this scandal
So a lot of the discussion in the campaign flowed down to
Is this really who you want representing you?
Southern Momentum's Maury Nicely again
He says he doubled down on this message, made the whole campaign very personal
Is this who you want? Look guys, is this who you want to marry?
Is this who you want to step up and say I do too?
When the campaign for the third election wrapped up, the vote tally came in
For the union, 776
Against it, 833
The union loses again
Now, some of this obviously had to do with the UAW's legal problems
The corruption scandal was like a gift
Oh yeah, oh yeah, absolutely, I mean I certainly take no revelry in that
But that obviously colored and influenced that election
Maury says he knew workers who were open to the idea of joining a union
They just didn't want to join the UAW
So the takeaway from union drive number three, it's kind of a self-evident one
Maybe don't have a giant scandal in the middle of your union election
Right, but Maury said there was more going on here than just the scandal
The real reason he says that this third union drive failed, really why they all failed
Was because of where they were taking place
We are a very right-leaning state, particularly in terms of politics
And union equals democrat, right?
And anti-union equals republican
So when you come into Tennessee, you're probably already dealing with that
On this point, union organizer Steve Cochran actually agrees
He says people decide whether they're pro or anti-union based partly on their political identities
But he says that didn't happen by accident
It was the result of a deliberate campaign by anti-union forces
They've politicized it
That's the biggest one that I've seen where they're saying, well, if you vote in favor of union, you're a democrat
And I'm like, no, that's not true
That has nothing to do with anything inside my workplace
It just doesn't, I mean, sorry, but democrat or republican, either one, you know, it doesn't matter
But they did a real good job of doing that, you know, playing them kind of politics with people
Steve has been at this for more than 10 years
He's tried three times to get his plan organized, but he says he's still not done
Do you think there's, is there a plan to try to unionize the whole plant again?
Oh, always. Oh, oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah, always, always
It's kind of a thing. You either give up or die, you know, I mean, you know, you keep pushing or you die
You just want it up, you know, don't give up
Steve has been watching the big UAW strikes happening right now across the country
If those go well for the union, maybe next time more workers at his plant in Chattanooga will vote yes
That is where we left it back in October 2023
Now, as we know, things did in the end go well for the union
So what changed? What changed to flip so many votes at the Chattanooga plant?
To answer that, we called up professor Stephen Sylvia again
If you want to start at what made things different
It was the election of Sean Fain
Sean Fain became president of the United Auto Workers in March of 2023
And late last year, he led the UAW on strike nationally
And won huge victories against the big three automakers
That's General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, which used to be Chrysler
Many people looking at it were in some ways skeptical at first
But the thing that was amazing is the way the UAW was very clever in selecting tactics
Traditionally, the UAW would target just one of the big three car companies at a time
But Sean Fain threw out that old playbook
And the UAW decided to hold strikes at all big three companies at the same time
But not at every single plant
They picked strategic plants
So when they shut one of these down, it meant that another plant downstream
Wouldn't be getting what they needed to do their jobs
So the whole thing was very disruptive to production
And it also let a lot more workers stay on the job collecting paychecks
By having a strike that would have a relatively small number of employees involved
You could shut down a significant amount of production
And they were very successful
And as the workers in the Chattanooga plant watched all of this
Another thing, Stephen says, that made Sean Fain and the UAW seem more attractive was transparency
Workers got to watch the UAW negotiate in real time
Often with live streaming updates on the negotiations
There's this one video where Sean Fain gives his response to a Stellantis offer
Everything they're looking for in this document is about concessions
So I'll tell you what I'm going to do with their proposal
I'm going to file it in its proper place
Because that's where it belongs, the trash, because that's what it is
Sean is different because he is so transparent and honest with everyone
That's the thing that we like best about him
This is Steve Cochran again, does maintenance for the Volkswagen factory in Tennessee
He's a union organizer
When I called him up, he was in his car driving home from work
Steve says that Sean's transparency tactics were able to change some people's perceptions of unions in the South
Having all that done in the public eye was very, very eye-opening, very educational for a lot of people everywhere
When we last left Steve, the union had just lost their third election
He and the other union organizers were getting ready to regroup
Since then, there's been one other big change, this time from the Volkswagen side
The company decided to stay neutral this time
They didn't put out a big anti-union campaign, they didn't put out fear tactics above us
They said, hey, it's going to be your decision
It's about the decision, what it is, and we'll stay as neutral as possible
And they did
Steve says this is because the brass at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany told the management at the Chattanooga factory that
You will not run an anti-union campaign
Because of that, the stalling tactics that the company had used last time did not come into play
So Steve Cochran said it was much easier to make his case this time
Even in conservative Tennessee, which is a right-to-work state where unions are very politicized
They're considered aligned with the Democratic party and are generally pretty unpopular
You have to understand though, there's a lot of Republican voting people in Chattanooga
A lot of them
We're never going to tell anybody how they should or shouldn't vote, that'll never happen
But everybody put that aside
They put all that aside and said, we've got to do it ourselves
And then, after all of those campaigns for in the past dozen or so years
Last week, workers at Steve Cochran's factory voted overwhelmingly to form a union
We had a watch party at the union office
And a lot of people were there and stuff
There was some good fireworks going off and some people drinking a little bit of alcohol and stuff
Nothing got out of hand
Steve, how did it feel to walk into work on the first day after the vote?
It is a lot better feeling than walking in after a loss, I know that
I was very proud and had the outcome and very smiling and stuff
But I didn't gloat
Steve said there were a couple of people who might have cheered a little, maybe a few handshakes, some high fives
But mostly people just got back to work, side by side with their colleagues, regardless of how they voted
We've been at this thing for 12 long years
It's a great feeling now, you know
But honestly, people can disagree about something
We're still going to do our job though and build the best quality cars we can
That shows you the true grit
And Steve's hoping that maybe this is the start of a new era of unionizing in the South
We're one of the first dominoes
So if our domino knocks their domino and the next domino
This may be a huge, huge push throughout all the automotive industry in the South
The next dominoes Steve hopes will fall are the Mercedes factory in Vance, Alabama
A Toyota engine plant in Missouri
A Hyundai plant in Alabama
And a plant that Volkswagen is currently building in South Carolina
