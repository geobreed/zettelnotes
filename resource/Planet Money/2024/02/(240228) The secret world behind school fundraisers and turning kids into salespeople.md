Fundraising is a staple of the school experience in the U.S. There's an assembly showing off all the prizes kids can win by selling enough wrapping paper or chocolate to their neighbors. But it's pretty weird, right?

Maria Lares is arguably the heart and soul of Villacorta Elementary School in La Puente, California. She's been teaching at the school for more than 30 years and has been on the Parent-Teacher Association there the entire time.

"The PTA actually means a lot to me," she says. "I'm an immigrant, and when I got here my parents – they worked 12 hours a day. So they never attended any school things. So as a teacher I said, 'Uh-uh, PTA's my baby!' And it has been for all these years."

The way Maria sees it, the main job of the school's PTA is to fund the activities that make school fun for kids — e.g., pizza parties for the honor roll students, bringing in a big reptile show for kids, or helping pay for the 6th graders to go to science camp for a week.

This year, Maria's number one priority is for the PTA to raise enough money to send every single kid at the school on at least one field trip.

It's been three years since the whole school went on one. The school didn't fundraise in time last year, and they didn't go on field trips the previous two years because of COVID-19. So this year, Maria is determined to make field trips happen. And she's looking forward to one field trip in particular for her first graders.

"I like to take my class to the beach. On a boat ride," she said. "They'll tell you, 'I've never been to the beach!' They have never been on boats before."

The beach is just 40 minutes away, but 90% of students at this school are economically disadvantaged and 20% are unhoused, so many of her students have never seen the ocean.

To pay for a trip to the beach and all the other field trips, the PTA at Villacorta Elementary raises money through their own fundraisers, like nacho sales and t-shirt sales. But those don't generate huge amounts of money, so once or twice a year, they'll go through a school fundraising company. Those companies put on these flashy assemblies where they show students all the prizes they could win if they sell enough chocolate, or popcorn, or wrapping paper.

"Mr. Cheesecake," aka Andrew Smith, is known for getting students to sell ... cheesecake. Here he is kicking off a school fundraiser.

Now offsetting the costs of field trips with fundraising happens at pretty much every school. Wealthy schools also fundraise to help cover the cost of their more expensive trips.

But why is this the system? Why do schools let companies come in to turn kids into little salespeople?

Public schools get their official budgets from local property taxes, as well as states and the federal funding. Technically, schools get more money per student today than they have historically gotten.

For Villacorta Elementary, the district gets around $4.5 million a year. It's about $16,000 per student at this school, which is a little more than the national average of $14,347, according to 2021 Census Data. But it's not like the principal gets all of that money to spend. The district actually spends almost all of it on things like salaries for teachers and benefits and the cost of running the building. What the principal gets to spend is closer to $1,200 per kid. And because it's public funds, there are a lot of rules about how he can spend this money.

"It's sort of a give and take," says the principal George Hererra. "If I put [the money] to field trips, then I shortchange somewhere."

But when the PTA raises money from fundraisers like selling cheesecake or chocolate, that is not part of the official school budget. It is not "public funds." So this money can go to anything. Which is very valuable to a school.

Marguerite Roza, a school funding expert at Georgetown Universitiy's McCourt School of Public Policy, said it would be possible to just change the rules about how school money can be spent. And, she said, if a school really wanted to prioritize field trips in their official budget, they could. No fundraising from the PTA necessary.

Because, of the $1,200 the principal gets per student, around $500 could be spent on field trips. That would be enough money to send everyone at the whole school on approximately 17 field trips a year. But that is not what this principal does.

George chooses to spend his budget on a teacher's aide for his students that are learning English and an attendance clerk to try to deal with the school's attendance problem. The clerk calls parents when a student is absent to ask why their child is missing school.

"For me, my decision is very academic-based. You know, what intervention do we need? Do we need to hire an intervention teacher? Do we need to provide after-school tutoring?"

And choosing to prioritize his budget this way might be tactical.

Marguerite Roza, the school funding expert, says it is a lot easier to ask parents and the community to pitch in for something like field trips than it is to go around asking parents to donate money to pay for the salary of an attendance clerk. The PTA could fundraise for that instead. But schools all over the U.S. choose to fundraise for the fun school perks instead because it works. People like to give money for this kind of cause.

But that means the fundraisers never stop.

Every year the PTA at Villacorta has a goal to raise $20,000. To get there, they held about 10 fundraisers: a popcorn fundraiser, a Mother's Day shop, a jogathon but with bubbles called a "bubble run." For one fundraiser, the teachers worked at McDonald's for a day. (The teachers made the fries, and the principal served cookies.)

One of the big fundraisers, the Bubble Run, was essentially a jogathon with bubbles. Students got the community to donate money.
Sarah Gonzalez/NPR

When the school uses a fundraising company, the company takes a cut of everything students sell. In Villacorta's experience, the company usually gets 60% and the school gets 40%, which is not the best deal. But the companies help the school bring in more money per fundraiser.

After a year of fundraising, Maria's school was just shy of their $20,000 goal. The sixth graders were the first to go on a field trip.They went to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California. But, all the other grades still have to go on their field trip; Maria's beach trip for the first graders still has to happen. So, the fundraising continues.

Their next fundraiser starts March 18th. They're selling peanut brittle, gummy bears and chocolate covered popcorn.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST:

Some of you may have had these assemblies in school, like in elementary school or in high school. There's music. The lights are dim, and some non-school person is on stage like, don't you want this glow-in-the-dark bike? Or how about a limo for you and your friends to go to Peter Piper Pizza? Just look at all these prizes.

SOPHIA FABELA: He was just like, and this bubble blower. And then he's like, we have a dancing space duck.

ANDREW SMITH: I don't know if you know what this is actually - Nintendo Switch Lite.

(CHEERING)

GONZALEZ: I'm talking about assemblies like this one.

SMITH: My name is Mr. Cheesecake.

(LAUGHTER)

GONZALEZ: Mr. Cheesecake, really Andrew Smith (ph), known for getting students to sell cheesecake because, yeah, to win some of these prizes...

SMITH: We have the Radical Rocket kids' scooter. We're going to have what we call the squish ball.

GONZALEZ: ...You have to sell stuff, like cheesecake or wrapping paper or little chocolate bunnies.

DANIELLE TORRES: We sold little popcorns and candies.

SOPHIA: There was chocolate bears with peanut butter inside. There was chili lemon peanuts, chili lemon mangoes.

RAY AGUILAR: I remember the jalapeno popcorn.

GONZALEZ: And the more you sell, the better the prizes.

SMITH: So everyone put your hands like this. Pump them up and say big money.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Big money.

SMITH: Now the reason...

GONZALEZ: A little weird, right? But this big money, flashing prizes in little kids' faces is the start of the classic beloved and despised school fundraiser. Every year, multiple times a year, schools all over the U.S. - wealthy schools, private schools, low-income schools - have this kind of kick off fundraising assembly.

SMITH: Now, the reason we're raising big money for your school is not only we're hoping to get a projector screen - a new one - but also, we are going to be doing things like field trips. Now, let me ask you, do you like field trips?

(CHEERING)

SMITH: Awesome. More field trips, more fun, more activities, more equipment, more supplies - everything comes back to you here at the school. So you're only helping yourself.

GONZALEZ: Not quite everything, but yes, the point of these assemblies is to raise money for schools. Fundraising is kind of baked into the school experience. But why? Why do schools turn kids into little salespeople? And why do we let companies come in like this and dangle prizes in front of students?

(SOUNDBITE OF RASCALS BASHING IMMATURE ROCK SONG, "NO SCHOOL NO RULES")

GONZALEZ: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sarah Gonzalez, and I have been following one school's fundraising efforts for over a year to see how much they raise and what the money goes to. The school, Villacorta Elementary in La Puente, Calif., has one big goal this year - to raise enough money to send every single student on one field trip. The whole school hasn't been able to go on one in three years. Today on the show, one year at one school to show us what it takes to send all of the first graders to the beach and fill the gaps in the official school budget.

OK. In order for someone like a Mr. Cheesecake...

SMITH: Say big money.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Big money.

GONZALEZ: ...Or any school fundraising company rep to be able to get access to students at, in this case, Villacorta Elementary and recruit them as little salespeople, they have to go through the school's PTA, the parent-teacher association. Particularly, they have to go through this woman...

MARIA LARES: Hello. I'm Maria Lares. This is my 39th year of teaching.

GONZALEZ: ...Maria Lares, longtime kindergarten teacher...

LARES: My love is in kindergarten.

GONZALEZ: ...Who recently started teaching first grade. And the first graders are bossy. They're opinionated, and she thinks it's super fun.

LARES: They can do more (laughter). I can reason with them. You know, it's a different ballgame. They run the show, too.

GONZALEZ: Her classroom is big and colorful. There's a playhouse, a writing station and artwork all up the walls, basically up to the ceiling.

How do you get up there?

LARES: I have to get - climb up there on a chair (laughter). But that's OK. Don't tell anybody.

GONZALEZ: (Laughter).

Maria is petite. She wears deep dark purple glasses, and she has this smile that just, like, reminds you of your kindergarten teacher, if you had a good one. Just watching her, you can tell she is a gem of a teacher, like the way she encourages her first graders in class.

LARES: You are going to be readers, I promise you. I'm going to teach you how to read, but you have to follow my directions. You have to do what I tell you.

GONZALEZ: Maria has been teaching at this school for 30 years, and she's been on the PTA here the entire time.

LARES: The PTA actually means a lot to me because when I was growing up - I'm an immigrant, and when I got here, my parents, they worked 12 hours a day, so they never attended any school things. So to me, I was - I always want to be part of the PTA. I always want - and I could never because my mom couldn't come. But so as a teacher, I said, uh-uh, PTA's my baby (laughter). And it has been for all these years. And besides teaching, I do everything that I can for PTA, not just the treasury but everything.

GONZALEZ: Maria is arguably the heart and soul of this school. She's the one with the goal of sending every single student on at least one field trip a year, and without Maria and the PTA, it might not happen.

Like zero field trips? You would not have - you wouldn't have any field trips?

GEORGE HERRERA: We're very limited into what we could do.

GONZALEZ: This is the principal at Maria's school, George Herrera.

You have - in your school budget, do you have a budget for field trips?

HERRERA: So I do have a budget, so it's sort of a give and take. You know, if I put it to field trips, then I shortchanged somewhere.

GONZALEZ: All right, here's how schools get funded. A lot of the money comes from local property taxes, but also states and the federal government give money, too. And technically, schools get more money per kid today than they have historically gotten. For Villacorta Elementary, the district gets like $4.5 million a year. It's about $16,000 per kid at the school, which is a little more than the national average. But it's not like the principal gets all of that money to spend, right? The district actually ends up spending almost all of it on things like salaries for teachers, benefits, the cost of running the building. What the principal gets to spend is closer to $1,200 per kid. And because it's public funds, there are a lot of rules about how he can spend this money. He does have to make choices.

HERRERA: And so I got to figure out sort of give and take, kind of like a home budget. What am I going to cut and what am I going to have?

GONZALEZ: Yeah. But when the PTA raises money from fundraisers like selling cheesecake or chocolate, that is not part of the official school budget. It is not public funds, so that money can go to anything, which is very, very valuable to a school. And the way Maria Lares, the gem of a teacher/PTA treasurer, sees it, the main job of her school's PTA is to fund the stuff that keeps school exciting for kids, like field trips or a big reptile show for students, nacho parties.

LARES: We provide all the fun stuff, I tell the kids, to get them here and wanting to come and wanting to do better.

GONZALEZ: Every year, this PTA's goal is to raise $20,000, and it goes to a lot.

LARES: Oh, there's just so many things that we fund.

GONZALEZ: The PTA helps pay for the sixth graders to go to an outdoor science camp for a week. They buy three books for every single student.

LARES: So that every single child could walk home with three books at the end of the year.

GONZALEZ: They really want to be able to buy risers for the new choir, but this year, the No. 1 priority is paying for field trips.

LARES: Since we've been - gone for so long without field trips.

GONZALEZ: Yeah, the school didn't fundraise in time to send everyone on a field trip last year, and they didn't go the year before or the year before that because of COVID. So it's been three years since the whole school went on one. But this year, Maria is determined to make field trips happen again. Every grade gets to decide where they want to go, but for Maria, there's really only one field trip she wants for her first graders...

LARES: I like to take my class to the beach on a boat, right?

GONZALEZ: ...A boat ride at the beach. And people are always like, really, are you sure?

LARES: You're taking the little ones to the beach? But I've always done it, and I've never had anything - knock on wood (laughter) - happen, so let's see.

GONZALEZ: Her school is in Los Angeles County, but many of her students have never seen the ocean.

LARES: They'll tell you, I've never been to the beach. They have never been on boats before. They don't even know.

GONZALEZ: How far is the closest beach to here?

LARES: Well, the one we go to is Newport Beach. It's a good 40 minutes away.

GONZALEZ: So, like, it's not like the beach is so far away.

LARES: It's not.

GONZALEZ: Yeah.

LARES: But just our community - lots of them don't have cars. They work weekends, you know?

GONZALEZ: When the little ones have gone on the big beach trip in the past, Maria says it's so worth it for them.

LARES: We let them go on the sand, look for shells, build castles. I mean, it's not a long time, but they do get to ride the boat, eat their lunch and play in the sand.

GONZALEZ: You know, it's not that expensive either. The boat ride, which is a little harbor tour, costs like $6 per kid. But Maria has found that that is too much to ask parents to pay. So she likes for the PTA to cover at least $3 of every boat ride.

LARES: So if it comes to three, maybe they can pay. And if they don't, we either have PTA or the teacher will just roll it (ph). She will.

GONZALEZ: Three dollars makes such a difference? You know, like, if it's $3, usually the parents will pay. If it's six, I don't know.

LARES: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anything after five they're like, hmm.

GONZALEZ: About 90% of students at this school are economically disadvantaged. Twenty percent are unhoused.

LARES: They're not out on the streets, but they are living with other families and in the garage and in places like that.

GONZALEZ: Right. It is a low-income school. But I mean, offsetting the costs of field trips for parents happens at all schools. Even really, really wealthy schools will fundraise to help cover the cost of, like, a big, fancy plane ride for students to visit the U.S. Capitol for a week. So OK, for Villacorta Elementary to send all the first graders to the beach and on a boat, they need like $120 for the boat ticket, plus another $600 for the school bus to get all of the kids to the beach and back. So Maria and the PTA need like $700. But that's just for the first grade field trip, right?

All in, for the whole school to go on a field trip - all eight grade levels, basically pre-K through sixth grade - they need nine school buses, plus the money to offset the cost of whatever play or aquarium or museum each class wants to go to. So really, they need like $8,000 a year for everyone to go on a field trip. But I mean, all year long they are paying for many things - right? - the science camp, the reptile show, three books for every student, so total goal - $20,000 raised. And the school organizes their own fundraisers to try to get there. They do jog-a-thons, nacho sales, T-shirt sales, but those do not raise huge amounts of money.

So once or twice a year, they'll also do a big - we'll call it - corporate fundraiser, where they go through a school fundraising company, you know, the ones that put on those flashy assemblies. And those companies - they, like, go looking for PTA members. They go looking for all of the Marias in a school. And they find them.

LARES: We've had people knocking on our doors trying to get us to change companies. And are you committed to them? They'll say, you know, because we have something to show you.

GONZALEZ: These companies do a lot to try to get a school's business. They take the PTA out.

LARES: At a restaurant like Olive Garden - I remember going - Red Lobster - they go all out. And they invite you during the summer to go out. And so and then look at the new products that they're going to have.

GONZALEZ: Like, what do you mean? What, like, they (laughter) invite you to Red Lobster and then...

LARES: And they feed you.

GONZALEZ: ...At the table - and they feed you, of course.

LARES: They treat us so nice to try to get our business because they know PTAs have big business. And they are, you know...

GONZALEZ: But it didn't used to be this way.

LARES: I worked at it for 30 years, and when I started, we had to go out and look. OK, so should we sell chocolate? What companies - we had to go looking for them. They didn't offer to come and feed us. And then it just became a business, like, over the years, I'd say the last 10 years.

GONZALEZ: Now, Maria gets to, like, choose who gets her business. And for her it is not about who takes her to Olive Garden. It comes down to which company rep is going to make her work easier. Like recently, this one rep said, you know what? I'll hand out the hundreds and hundreds of bags of popcorn that your kids sell so you don't have to - pfft (ph), sold.

LARES: I'm a classroom teacher. I don't have time to be sorting things and putting them in teacher's boxes. And then that teacher said, I never got it. And I said, but I put it right here, you know?

GONZALEZ: You can just tell she's done that many times. Once a rep said, I can give you 50% of the profit of everything that students sell, which is not the usual split. Normally, the company takes more. But for the school to keep 50% of the profit, there would be no prizes. And Maria was like, oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, we need the prizes.

LARES: The kids will get motivated by those prizes rather than saying, oh, it's all for your school, just keep selling (laughter). You're doing great. No, no.

GONZALEZ: For Maria, there is something a little bit uncomfortable about all of this, you know, turning kids into little salespeople or promising them all these prizes that they probably won't ever get because you have to sell, like, $1,000 worth of whatever just to get that Nintendo Switch Lite that really just cost, like, $200.

Does it feel bad? Like, does it feel bad...

LARES: It feels bad, yeah, that they're looking at these little prizes they wish they had. But, you know, we'll make it up to them in another way. There's always a way that they're going to get a treasure box, and they'll get those little items that they want.

GONZALEZ: This PTA does make sure that there are some fundraisers, like the one that big money Mr. Cheesecake was here for, where all kids got little prizes like a magic pencil or a squish ball, even if they didn't raise any money or sell anything. After the break, we meet the little salespeople and find out - why do schools fundraise like this at all? Like, why is this the system?

(SOUNDBITE OF GOURMET GROOVES' "GIVE 'EM THAT OLD SCHOOL")

GONZALEZ: All right, let's meet some sales kids.

SOPHIA: Hi. I'm Sophia Fabela.

SAMANTHA NICOLE TAN: Hi. My name is Samantha Nicole Tan.

GONZALEZ: Sophia and Samantha, 10 and 8 years old and best friends, with the caveat that they have other best friends, too.

SAMANTHA: 'Cause, like, my other best friend, her name is Violet (ph).

GONZALEZ: Sophia wants to be an artist when she grows up.

SOPHIA: Ding, ding, ding.

GONZALEZ: Samantha wants to be a doctor...

SAMANTHA: To take care of kids.

GONZALEZ: ...Or join the military...

SAMANTHA: To, like, save people.

GONZALEZ: ...Or maybe be a doctor in the military.

SAMANTHA: Yeah, probably.

GONZALEZ: And both Samantha and Sophia consider themselves pretty good salespeople.

SAMANTHA: I'm kind of trustable and understandable and also kind of funny.

SOPHIA: I agree.

GONZALEZ: (Laughter).

When I meet them, it is their big fall fundraiser from one of those companies. They're doing what is called a catalog fundraiser. It's a fundraiser where there is a catalog of popcorn and other treats. And Samantha's strategy is to explain why you might like the kettle corn.

SAMANTHA: 'Cause it has, like, a sweet taste in there that mostly people like, but not all.

GONZALEZ: Now, these kids are not out there, like, knocking on strangers' doors asking them to buy treats. That is not really how the school fundraiser goes anymore. They're just, like, texting their favorite aunt, their grandparents, asking them to buy. They're giving the catalog to their parents.

SOPHIA: So my mom took it to work. Doo, doo, doo (ph), I got a lot of money.

GONZALEZ: Sophia sold 83 items, which did add up.

SOPHIA: I almost got, like, $1,000 from the popcorns. Yeah, like $944.

GONZALEZ: That is a lot of money worth of popcorn. Students at the school sold about $11,500 worth of popcorn stuff in total, but the school got to keep just, like, $5,000 of that because about 60% of the money goes to the fundraising company and for the cost of the popcorn. About 40% goes to the school. So it is not, like, a great, great deal for the school. This fundraiser brought in about a quarter of their goal. Remember, the goal is $20,000. We want those field trips and all the other things the PTA funds. So the fundraising keeps happening all year long. Sometimes the school sells stuff. The PTA held a Santa Shop where kids could buy, like, little gifts and trinkets for their families. They also held a Valentine's Day shop, a Mother's Day shop. Those shops, on average, brought in $1,500 each. So six months in, they're almost halfway to their goal. Summer comes. Sophia and Samantha move up a grade.

You're just growing so fast. How you been?

SOPHIA: Doing good.

GONZALEZ: Yeah?

They get awards, made Honor Roll.

HERRERA: Samantha Tan, come on up.

(APPLAUSE)

HERRERA: You made the Principal's Honor roll. Sophia Fabela, come on up.

(APPLAUSE)

GONZALEZ: The principal gives them a certificate but tells them the real award is on the way.

HERRERA: Oh, we have a medal coming in for you. It didn't get here in time, but it should be here when we come back from break.

GONZALEZ: You guys, Honor Roll? That's like the best award.

And the fundraising continues. The next big fundraiser is a giant foam party, basically - a bubble run, kind of like a jog-a-thon but with bubbles everywhere.

SAMANTHA: We get to go into the bubble pit. And, like, you get your shoes wet.

GONZALEZ: Sophia?

SOPHIA: Yes?

GONZALEZ: What do you think?

SOPHIA: It's very exciting. I'm getting it all in my hair 'cause I have to shower today anyways.

(LAUGHTER)

SOPHIA: Oh my goodness.

GONZALEZ: The community donated about $10,000 for this fundraiser, too. But again, the company takes their cut.

LARES: So, I mean, it sounds beautiful, but we only get about 5,000.

GONZALEZ: But OK, they are three-quarters of the way to their goal. And it is not just the students who fundraise. The teachers do it, too. The teachers basically worked at McDonald's for a couple hours one day as a fundraiser.

LARES: So we go to McDonald's. And we as teachers, we serve the kids, and they order from us. And Dr. Herrera's selling cookies and - you know, and I'm making fries and things like that. And at the end of the night, they give us - I don't know if it's 40% of the profits.

GONZALEZ: Ugh, teachers working at McDonald's making fries after a day of teaching? This brought in $874. Now, if all of this seems like a lot of work for not a lot of payoff, yes, you're right.

It's interesting because, like, so much effort goes into pulling off something like...

LARES: (Laughter) You're telling me. I know it. I know it. I know.

GONZALEZ: And then you're like, for $500? Like, but...

LARES: It's OK. It's more the community - getting your community involved and getting them here is what counts.

GONZALEZ: A lot of schools and principals will say this, that it's not really about the money you raise but the experience, the lessons that kids learn. But after a year of following these fundraisers, I just kept thinking, like, there is a more efficient way to get the money you need. There was this one parent-teacher organization president in Alabama who basically said, we are tired of these fundraisers. You're tired of these fundraisers. If you give us $50, we will forget your name and face and not ask you to bake anything or sell anything for the rest of the year. And it went viral. So many people were like, yes, this is the kind of fundraiser I can get on board with. You know, many economists would say that that is the better fundraiser.

Economists would say, just give people the cash. If people need money, just give them the cash. Don't make them buy something. Don't make them, like, volunteer. Just give them the thing that they need. And so I was curious, like, can you just ask people to donate money?

LARES: No. In my community, if you say, send me the $8 for the PTA - and they're like, what am I getting from that? What do I get? We had to get an incentive to go with it.

GONZALEZ: So people like to feel like they're getting something for their money?

LARES: Yeah, they need to see that there's something in return, yes - in my community, yes.

GONZALEZ: Yeah, people like getting a bag of jalapeno popcorn to munch on or, you know, a big bubble party for their kids. It feels more satisfying than just handing over cash. And remember, the cash that the PTA raises is, like, this special, magical pot of money that comes with essentially no rules. If the principal ever needs to, like, fill the gaps in his official school budget, he can go to the PTA, which happens.

LARES: Principal come - well, you know, we need this, but we don't have money to buy the printers ink. So then we will say, OK, do we approve? OK, let's buy some ink for these printers for the teachers could do their job, yeah.

HERRERA: (Laughter) So the - what happened today is that we're dealing with a budget and a category.

GONZALEZ: Again, the principal George Herrera.

HERRERA: We have money right now. Sometimes I have a lot of money in one area, but I cannot transfer it to another area.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. When you're dealing with official public funds, there are a lot of rules. Like, George needed just $40 for something, but he didn't have the money in the right pot.

HERRERA: So I have my office manager calling fiscal saying, can we move $40 over there? And she goes, well, let me try; let me figure it out, right? And so PTA is able to cut through a lot of the red tape.

GONZALEZ: PTA will just be like, here's $40.

HERRERA: Here's a check, yeah. Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. If the school budget is like a bank asking you why you want to take out your own money, the PTA is like your rich aunt who can just give you money whenever you need it.

What do you need the $40 for?

HERRERA: (Laughter) This was a particular - we wanted to buy medals that we want to give the students. And we're short a couple of medals. And I said, just let me order them now, and they go (ph), nope. But can we - nope.

GONZALEZ: Is this what you were telling Sophia when you were like, I have a medal for you, but it's not here yet.

HERRERA: Yes, yes.

GONZALEZ: It's - these are the medals? Oh, my gosh.

HERRERA: Those are the medals we were talking about.

GONZALEZ: This was the Principal's Honor Roll medal.

HERRERA: It's the Principal's Honor Roll medal, yes.

GONZALEZ: Now, OK, I spoke to a school funding expert, Marguerite Roza, at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy, who was kind of, like, all right, so change the rules about how the money can be spent. But also, she said, you know, if the school really wanted to prioritize medals or field trips in their budget, they could - right? - 'cause after this district pays for all of this school's teacher salaries, the benefits, the building, the principal gets, like, $1,200 per kid, right? And of that, he technically has, like, $500 per kid that he could spend on field trips if he wanted to. That would be enough money to send the whole school on, like, 17 field trips - no fundraising from the PTA necessary. But that is not what this principal does.

HERRERA: For me, my decision is, you know, very academic based. You know, what intervention do we need? Do we need to hire an intervention teacher? Do we need to provide an after school tutoring?

GONZALEZ: Yeah, George chooses to spend his budget on a teacher's aide for his students that are learning English, an attendance clerk because many of the kids at this school have excessive absences. They miss a lot of school. So the clerk calls all the parents to be like, what's going on? Why is your kid absent? And the school funding expert does get why the principal chooses to prioritize his budget this way - because it is a lot easier to ask parents and the community to pitch in for something like field trips and medals than it is to go around saying, don't you want to donate money to pay for the salary of our attendance clerk? The PTA could ask for that instead, but all kinds of schools fundraise for the fun school perks because it works. People like to give money for this kind of cause. So when George prioritizes his budget in this way, it's smart. It's tactical.

One year and 10 fundraisers later, Villacorta Elementary was just shy of their $20,000 goal.

(SOUNDBITE OF BUS BRAKES SQUEALING)

GONZALEZ: The sixth graders are the first to go on a field trip.

MIA MANUELOS: I want to see sharks. I want to see a shark.

AURORA CARDONA: They have a little, like, shark petting area, I think.

JOSHUA SALCEDO: I saw that they had, like, the tiger shark.

GONZALEZ: These are sixth graders, Mia Manuelos (ph), Aurora Cardona (ph) and Joshua Salcedo (ph). They are on a bus headed to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.

JOSHUA: They might have hammerheads.

GONZALEZ: About an hour later, they arrive.

UNIDENTIFIED GUIDE: Please do not grab or scratch our animals.

GONZALEZ: And they head straight for the sharks.

MIA: Did you touch it?

(LAUGHTER)

MIA: I'm scared. Oh, oh.

AURORA: Why would you go for the head?

MIA: It feels slimy and soft.

GONZALEZ: So this is the sixth grade field trip.

AURORA: Ah, they're too deep.

GONZALEZ: But they're still fundraising. They still need all of the other classes to go on a field trip. Maria Lares' famous beach trip for the first graders still has to happen.

MIA: I want to see more.

GONZALEZ: The school's next fundraiser starts March 18. They're selling peanut brittle, gummy bears, chocolate-covered popcorn.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GONZALEZ: Having a kid in the United States is extremely expensive. There's no paid parental leave, no real public daycare to speak of. But in lots of other countries, all of that is covered and more.

So I am here to try to see if we can make a deal. I have babies. You have social support programs. Let's see what we can do.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Yeah, just come over.

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Move to Sweden immediately.

GONZALEZ: I mean, OK.

Coming up, we are on a mission to learn what country offers the best support package for parents and why those packages even exist. We're going benefits shopping. That's next time on PLANET MONEY.

This is Planet Money from NPR.
Some of you may have had these assemblies in school,
like in elementary school or in high school.
There's music, the lights are dim,
and some non-school person is on stage,
like, don't you want this glow-in-the-dark bike?
Or how about a limo for you and your friends
to go to Peter Piper Pizza?
Just look at all these prizes.
He was just like, and this bubble blower.
And then he's like, we have a dancing space duck.
I don't know if you know what this is, actually.
Nintendo Switch Lite!
I'm talking about assemblies like this one.
My name is Mr. Cheesecake.
Mr. Cheesecake, really, Andrew Smith,
known for getting students to sell cheesecake.
Because, yeah, to win some of these prizes?
We have the Radical Rocket Kid Scooter.
We're going to have what we call the Squish Ball.
You have to sell stuff, like cheesecake, or wrapping paper,
or little chocolate bunnies.
We sold little popcorns and candies.
There was chocolate bears with peanut butter inside.
There was chili lemon peanuts, chili lemon mangoes.
I remember the jalapeno popcorn.
And the more you sell, the better the prizes.
So everyone put your hands like this.
Pump them up and say, big money.
A little weird, right?
But this big money flashing prizes in little kid spaces
is the start of the classic, beloved and despised school
fundraiser.
Every year, multiple times a year, schools all over the US,
wealthy schools, private schools, low income schools,
have this kind of kickoff fundraising assembly.
The reason we're raising big money for your school
is not only we're hoping to get a projector screen,
but also we are going to be doing things like field trips.
Now let me ask you, do you like field trips?
Yes!
Awesome, more field trips, more fun, more activities,
more equipment, more supplies.
Everything comes back to you here at the school.
So you're only helping yourself.
Not quite everything.
But yes, the point of these assemblies
is to raise money for schools.
Fundraising is kind of baked in to the school experience.
But why?
Why do schools turn kids into little salespeople?
And why do we let companies come in like this
and dangle prizes in front of students?
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Sarah Gonzalez, and I have been following one school's
fundraising efforts for over a year
to see how much they raise and what the money goes to.
The school, Villa Corta Elementary
in La Puente, California, has one big goal this year,
to raise enough money to send every single student
on one field trip.
The whole school hasn't been able to go on one
in three years.
Today on the show, one year at one school
to show us what it takes
to send all of the first graders to the beach
and fill the gaps in the official school budget.
Support for this podcast
and the following message come from WISE,
the app that makes managing your money
in different currencies easy.
With WISE, you can send and spend money
internationally at the mid-market exchange rate.
No guesswork and no hidden fees.
Learn more about how WISE could work for you at WISE.com.
Okay, in order for someone like a Mr. Cheesecake.
Say big money.
Big money.
Or any school fundraising company rep
to be able to get access to students at,
in this case, Villa Corta Elementary
and recruit them as little salespeople,
they have to go through the school's PTA,
the Parent Teacher Association.
Particularly, they have to go through this woman.
Hello, I'm Maria Lares.
This is my 39th year of teaching.
Maria Lares, long time kindergarten teacher.
My love is in kindergarten.
Who recently started teaching first grade
and the first graders are bossy,
they're opinionated and she thinks it's super fun.
They can do more.
I can reason with them, you know,
it's a different ball game.
They run the show too.
Her classroom is big and colorful.
There's a playhouse, a writing station
and artwork all up the walls,
basically up to the ceiling.
How do you get up there?
I have to climb up there on a chair.
But that's okay, don't tell anybody.
Maria is petite.
She wears deep, dark purple glasses
and she has this smile that just like,
reminds you of your kindergarten teacher
if you had a good one.
Just watching her, you can tell she is a gem of a teacher.
Like the way she encourages her first graders in class.
You are gonna be readers.
I promise you, I'm gonna teach you how to read,
but you have to follow my directions.
You have to do what I tell you.
Maria's been teaching at this school for 30 years
and she's been on the PTA here the entire time.
The PTA actually means a lot to me
because when I was growing up,
I'm an immigrant and when I got here,
my parents, they work 12 hours a day.
So they never attended any school things.
So to me, I was, I always wanna be part of the PTA.
I always want, and I could never
because my mom couldn't come.
But so as a teacher, I said,
uh-uh, PTA is my baby and has been for all these years.
And besides teaching, I do everything that I can
for PTA, not just the treasury, but everything.
Maria is arguably the heart and soul of this school.
She's the one with the goal of sending
every single student on at least one field trip a year.
And without Maria and the PTA, it might not happen.
Like zero field trips, you would not have,
you wouldn't have any field trips?
You're very limited into what we could do.
This is the principal at Maria's school, George Herrera.
You have a near school budget.
Do you have a budget for field trips?
So I do have a budget.
So it's sort of a give and take.
You know, if I put it to field trips,
then I sure change somewhere.
All right, here's how schools get funded.
A lot of the money comes from local property taxes,
but also states and the federal government give money too.
And technically, schools get more money per kid today
than they have historically gotten.
For via Corte Elementary,
the district gets like $4.5 million a year.
It's about $16,000 per kid at the school,
which is a little more than the national average.
But it's not like the principal
gets all of that money to spend, right?
The district actually ends up spending almost all of it
on things like salaries for teachers,
benefits, the cost of running the building.
What the principal gets to spend
is closer to $1,200 per kid.
And because it's public funds,
there are a lot of rules
about how he can spend this money.
He does have to make choices.
And so I got to figure out sort of give and take,
kind of like a home budget.
What am I gonna cut and what am I gonna have?
Yeah, but when the PTA raises money
from fundraisers like selling cheesecake or chocolate,
that is not part of the official school budget.
It is not public funds.
So that money can go to anything,
which is very, very valuable to a school.
And the way Maria Lares,
the gem of a teacher, PTA treasurer, sees it,
the main job of her school's PTA
is to fund the stuff that keeps school exciting for kids,
like field trips or a big reptile show for students,
nacho parties.
We provide all the fun stuff I tell the kids
to get them here and wanting to come
and wanting to do better.
Every year, this PTA's goal is to raise $20,000.
And it goes to a lot.
Oh, there's just so many things that we fund.
The PTA helps pay for the sixth graders
to go to an outdoor science camp for a week.
They buy three books for every single student.
So that every single child could walk home
with three books at the end of the year.
They really want to be able to buy risers
for the new choir.
But this year, the number one priority
is paying for field trips.
Since we've been gone for so long without field trips.
Yeah, the school didn't fundraise in time
to send everyone on a field trip last year.
And they didn't go the year before
or the year before that because of COVID.
So it's been three years
since the whole school went on one.
But this year, Maria is determined
to make field trips happen again.
Every grade gets to decide where they want to go.
But for Maria, there's really only one field trip
she wants for her first graders.
I like to take my class to the beach on a boat ride.
A boat ride at the beach.
And people are always like, really?
Are you sure?
You're taking the little ones to the beach?
But I've always done it
and I've never had anything in Hong Kong would happen.
So let's see.
Her school is in Los Angeles County,
but many of her students have never seen the ocean.
They'll tell you, I've never been to the beach.
They have never been on boats before.
They don't even know.
How far is the closest beach to here?
Well, the one we go to is Newport Beach.
It's a good 40 minutes away.
So like, it's not like the beach is so far away.
It's not.
But just our community,
lots of them don't have cars.
They work weekends.
When the little ones have gone
on the big beach trip in the past,
Maria says it's so worth it for them.
We let them go on the sand,
look for shells, build castles.
I mean, it's not a long time,
but they do get to ride the boat,
eat their lunch, and play in the sand.
You know, it's not that expensive either.
The boat ride, which is a little harbor tour,
costs like $6 per kid.
But Maria has found that that is too much
to ask parents to pay.
So she likes for the PTA to cover at least $3
of every boat ride.
So if it comes to three, maybe they can pay.
And if they don't, we either have PTA,
or the teacher will just throw it in.
She will.
$3 makes such a difference, you know?
Like if it's $3, usually the parents will pay.
If it's six, I don't know.
Anything after five, they're like, mm.
About 90% of students at the school
are economically disadvantaged.
20% are unhoused.
They're not out in the streets,
but they are living with other families
and in the garage and places like that.
Right, it is a low-income school.
But I mean, offsetting the costs of field trips
for parents happens at all schools.
Even really, really wealthy schools will fundraise
to help cover the costs of like a big,
fancy plane ride for students to visit
the U.S. Capitol for a week.
So okay, for Via Corta Elementary
to send all the first graders to the beach
and on a boat, they need like $120 for the boat ticket
plus another $600 for the school bus
to get all of the kids to the beach and back.
So Maria and the PTA need like $700.
But that's just for the first grade field trip, right?
All in, for the whole school to go on a field trip,
all eight grade levels,
basically pre-K through sixth grade,
they need nine school buses
plus the money to offset the cost
of whatever play or aquarium or museum
each class wants to go to.
So really, they need like $8,000 a year
for everyone to go on a field trip.
But I mean, all year long,
they are paying for many things, right?
The science camp, the reptile show,
three books for every student.
So total goal, $20,000 raised.
And the school organizes their own fundraisers
to try to get there.
They do jogathons, nacho sales, T-shirt sales.
But those do not raise huge amounts of money.
So once or twice a year, they'll also do a big,
we'll call it corporate fundraiser,
where they go through a school fundraising company,
the ones that put on those flashy assemblies.
And those companies,
they like go looking for PTA members.
They go looking for all of the Marias in a school
and they find them.
We've had people knocking on our doors
trying to get us to change companies
and are you committed to them?
They'll say, you know,
because we have something to show you.
These companies do a lot
to try to get a school's business.
They take the PTA out.
At a restaurant, like Olive Garden,
I remember going, Red Lobster,
they go all out and they invite you
during the summer to go out
and then look at the new products
that they're going to have.
Like, what do you mean?
Well, like they invite you to Red Lobster
and then at the table,
and they feed you, of course.
They treat us so nice to try to get our business
because they know PTAs have big business
and they are, you know.
But it didn't used to be this way.
I worked at it for 30 years
and when I started,
we had to go out and look,
okay, so should we sell chocolate?
What companies?
We had to go looking for them.
Then an offer to come and feed us.
And then it just became a business,
like over the years.
I say the last 10 years.
Now, Maria gets to like choose who gets her business.
And for her, it is not about
who takes her to Olive Garden.
It comes down to which company rep
is going to make her work easier.
Like recently, this one rep said,
you know what?
I'll hand out the hundreds and hundreds of bags
of popcorn that your kids sell
so you don't have to, sold.
I'm a classroom teacher.
I don't have time to be sorting things
and putting them in teacher's boxes.
And then that you say, I never got it.
And I said, but I put it right here.
You can just tell she's done that many times.
Once a rep said,
I can give you 50% of the profit
of everything that students sell,
which is not the usual split.
Normally the company takes more,
but for the school to keep 50% of the profit,
there would be no prizes.
And Maria was like,
oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We need the prizes.
The kids will get motivated by those prices
rather than say, oh, it's all for your school.
Just keep selling.
You're doing great.
No, no.
For Maria, there is something a little bit uncomfortable
about all of this,
turning kids into little salespeople
or promising them all these prizes
that they probably won't ever get
because you have to sell like $1,000 worth of whatever
just to get that Nintendo Switch Lite
that really just costs like $200.
Does it feel bad?
Like, does it feel bad?
Yeah, that they're looking at these little prices
that they wish they had,
but we'll make it up to them in another way.
There's always a way that they're gonna get a treasure box
and they'll get those little items that they want.
This PTA does make sure that there are some fundraisers
like the one that big money Mr. Cheesecake was here for
where all kids got little prizes
like a magic pencil or a squish ball,
even if they didn't raise any money or sell anything.
After the break, we meet the little salespeople
and find out why do schools fundraise like this at all?
Like, why is this the system?
All right, let's meet some sales kids.
Hi, I'm Sophia Fabella.
Hi, my name is Samantha Nicolten.
Sophia and Samantha, 10 and eight years old
and best friends with the caveat
that they have other best friends too.
Cause like my other best friend, her name is Violet.
Sophia wants to be an artist when she grows up.
Ding, ding, ding.
Samantha wants to be a doctor.
To take care of kids.
Or join the military.
To like save people.
Or maybe be a doctor in the military.
Yeah, probably.
And both Samantha and Sophia
consider themselves pretty good salespeople.
I'm kind of trustable and understandable
and also kind of funny.
I agree.
When I meet them, it is their big fall fundraiser
from one of those companies.
They're doing what is called a catalog fundraiser.
It's a fundraiser where there's a catalog
of popcorn and other treats.
And Samantha's strategy is to explain
why you might like the kettle corn.
Cause it has like a sweet taste in there
that mostly people like, but not all.
Now these kids are not out there
knocking on strangers' doors, asking them to buy treats.
That is not really how the school fundraiser goes anymore.
They're just like texting their favorite aunt,
their grandparents, asking them to buy.
They're giving the catalog to their parents.
So my mom took it to work.
Do, do, do.
I got a lot of money.
Sophia sold 83 items, which did add up.
I almost got like $1,000 from the popcorns.
Yeah, like $944.
That is a lot of money worth of popcorn.
Students at the school sold about $11,500
worth of popcorn stuff in total.
But the school got to keep just like $5,000 of that
because about 60% of the money
goes to the fundraising company
and for the cost of the popcorn.
About 40% goes to the school.
So it is not like a great, great deal for the school.
This fundraiser brought in about a quarter of their goal.
Remember the goal is $20,000.
We want those field trips
and all the other things the PTA funds.
So the fundraising keeps happening all year long.
Sometimes the school sells stuff.
The PTA held a Santa shop where kids could buy
like little gifts and trinkets for their families.
They also held a Valentine's Day shop,
a Mother's Day shop.
Those shops on average brought in $1,500 each.
So six months in, they're almost halfway to their goal.
Summer comes.
Sophia and Samantha move up a grade.
We're just growing so fast.
How you been?
Yeah.
They get awards, made honor roll.
Samantha Tan, come on up.
The principal's honor roll, Sophia Fabella.
The principal gives them a certificate
but tells them the real award is on the way.
Oh, we have a medal coming in for you.
We didn't get here in time,
but it should be here when we come back from break.
You guys, honor roll.
That's like the best award.
And the fundraising continues.
The next big fundraiser is a giant foam party,
basically, a bubble run.
Kind of like a jog-a-thon, but with bubbles everywhere.
We get to go into the bubble pit
and you get your shoes wet.
Sophia, what do you think?
It's very exciting.
I'm getting it all in my hair
because I have to shower today anyways.
Oh my goodness.
The community donated about $10,000 for this fundraiser too.
But again, the company takes their cut.
So I mean, it sounds beautiful,
but we only get about 5,000.
But okay, they're three quarters of the way to their goal.
And it is not just the students who fundraise.
The teachers do it too.
The teachers basically worked at McDonald's
for a couple hours one day as a fundraiser.
So we go to McDonald's and we, as teachers,
we serve the kids and they order from us
and Dr. Herrera's selling cookies
and I'm making fries and things like that.
And at the end of the night, they give us,
I don't know if it's 40% of the profits.
Oh, teachers working at McDonald's,
making fries after a day of teaching.
This brought in $874.
Now, if all of this seems like a lot of work
for not a lot of payoff, yes, you're right.
It's interesting because like so much effort
goes into pulling off something like-
I know it, I know it.
And then you're like, for $500, like, but-
It's okay, it's more the community,
getting your community involved
and getting them here is what counts.
A lot of schools and principals will say this,
that it's not really about the money you raise,
but the experience, the lessons that kids learn.
But after a year of following these fundraisers,
I just kept thinking, like,
there is a more efficient way to get the money you need.
There was this one parent-teacher organization president
in Alabama who basically said,
we are tired of these fundraisers,
you're tired of these fundraisers.
If you give us $50, we will forget your name and face
and not ask you to bake anything or sell anything
for the rest of the year.
And it went viral.
So many people were like,
yes, this is the kind of fundraiser
I can get on board with.
Many economists would say that that is the better fundraiser.
Economists would say, just give people the cash.
If people need money, just give them the cash.
Don't make them buy something,
don't make them, like, volunteer.
Just give them the thing that they need.
And so I was curious, like,
can you just ask people to donate money?
No, in my community, if you say,
send me the $8 for the PGA,
and they're like, what am I getting from that?
What do I get?
We have to get an incentive to go with it.
So people like to feel like they're getting something
for their money?
They need to see that there's something in return.
In my community, yes.
Yeah, people like getting a bag of jalapeño popcorn
to munch on, or, you know,
a big bubble party for their kids.
It feels more satisfying than just handing over cash.
And remember, the cash that the PTA raises
is like this special magical pot of money
that comes with essentially no rules.
If the principal ever needs to, like,
fill the gaps in his official school budget,
he can go to the PTA, which happens.
Principal come, well, you know, we need this,
but we don't have money to buy the printer's ink.
So then we will say, okay, do we approve?
Okay, let's buy some ink for these printers
so the teachers could do their job, yeah.
So what happened today is that we're dealing
with a budget in a category.
Again, the principal, George Herrera.
We have money right now.
Sometimes I have a lot of money in one area,
but I cannot transfer it to another area.
Yeah, when you're dealing with official public funds,
there are a lot of rules.
Like, George needed just $40 for something,
but he didn't have the money in the right pot.
So I have my office manager calling Fiscal saying,
can we move $40 over there?
And she goes, well, let me try it.
Let me figure it out, right?
And so PTA is able to cut through a lot of the red tape.
PTA just be like, here's $40.
It's a check, yeah, yeah, pretty much, pretty much.
Yeah, if the school budget is like a bank
asking you why you wanna take out your own money,
the PTA is like your rich aunt
who can just give you money whenever you need it.
What do you need the $40 for?
This was a particular, we wanted to buy metals
that we wanna give the students
and we're short a couple of metals.
And I said, just let me order them now
and go, nope, but can we, nope.
Is this what you were telling Sophia when you were like,
I have a metal for you, but it's not here yet.
It's these are the metals, oh my gosh.
Those are the metals we were talking about.
This was the principal's honor roll metal.
It's the principal's honor roll metal, yes.
Now, okay, I spoke to a school funding expert,
Marguerite Rosa at Georgetown's
McCourt School of Public Policy,
who was kind of like, all right,
so change the rules about how the money can be spent.
But also she said, you know,
if the school really wanted to prioritize metals
or field trips in their budget, they could, right?
Cause after this district pays
for all of the school's teacher salaries,
the benefits, the building,
the principal gets like $1,200 per kid, right?
And of that, he technically has like $500 per kid
that he could spend on field trips if he wanted to.
That would be enough money
to send the whole school on like 17 field trips.
No fundraising from the PTA necessary.
But that is not what this principal does.
For me, my decision is, you know, very academic based.
You know, what intervention do we need?
Do we need to hire an intervention teacher?
Do we need to provide an afterschool tutoring?
Yeah, George chooses to spend his budget
on a teacher's aid for his students
that are learning English, an attendance clerk,
because many of the kids at the school
have excessive absences.
They miss a lot of school.
So the clerk calls all the parents to be like,
what's going on?
Why is your kid absent?
And the school funding expert does get
why the principal chooses to prioritize his budget
this way.
Because it is a lot easier to ask parents
and the community to pitch in
for something like field trips and medals
than it is to go around saying,
don't you wanna donate money
to pay for the salary of our attendance clerk?
The PTA could ask for that instead,
but all kinds of schools fundraise
for the fun school perks because it works.
People like to give money for this kind of cause.
So when George prioritizes his budget in this way,
it's smart, it's tactical.
One year and 10 fundraisers later,
Villa Corte Elementary was just shy
of their $20,000 goal.
The sixth graders are the first to go on a field trip.
I wanna see sharks.
I see a shark.
Like shark petting area, I think.
I saw that they had like the tiger shark.
These are sixth graders Mia Banuelos,
Aurora Cardona and Joshua Salcedo.
They are on a bus headed to the Aquarium
of the Pacific in Long Beach.
They might have hammerheads.
About an hour later, they arrive.
Please do not grab or scratch our animals.
And they head straight for the sharks.
Did you touch it?
Really?
Oh!
I'm scared.
Why would you go for the head?
It feels slimy and soft.
So this is the sixth grade field trip.
Ah, they're too deep.
But they're still fundraising.
They still need all of the other classes
to go on a field trip.
Maria Lars' famous beach trip
for the first graders still has to happen.
I wanna see more.
The school's next fundraiser starts March 18th.
They're selling peanut brittle,
gummy bears, chocolate covered popcorn.
Having a kid in the United States is extremely expensive.
There's no paid parental leave,
no real public daycare to speak of.
But in lots of other countries,
all of that is covered and more.
So I am here to try to see if we can make a deal.
I have babies, you have social support programs.
Let's see what we can do.
Yep, just come over.
Move to Sweden immediately.
I mean, okay.
Coming up, we are on a mission to learn
what country offers the best support package for parents
and why those packages even exist.
We're going benefits shopping.
That's next time on Planet Money.
The kids you heard at the top of the show
are Danielle Torres, Sofia Fabela, and Ray Aguilar.
