A lot can happen after we put an episode out into the world. In The Rest Of The Story, we check-in on stories we've reported. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here

The artist Paul Gardner once said, "A painting is never finished. It simply stops in interesting places." Which is exactly what we tell ourselves here at Planet Money, as we try and put out two shows a week.

We travel the globe looking for compelling stories about economics, and the most fascinating characters we can find. And then we beg for time to tell the story. We would spend years working on each one. But there are deadlines and shows to put out.

Often, even as we end our stories and publish them, we feel like they're not finished yet. They just stopped in interesting places.

Today on our yearly update show, we go back to those interesting places to tell you what happened after we turned off our microphones. We check in on the Universal Postal Union, we find out what happened to the plane that got stuck in Iran, we calculate how much Mattress Mack lost betting on baseball, and more.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1, BYLINE: Hello?

ALYSSA: Hello.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Hi. Who am I talking to?

ALYSSA: Alyssa (ph). I'm in second grade, and I'm a Brownie Girl Scout.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: And, Alyssa, we want to try to get people to donate to NPR, and so I want you to tell us all of your tricks about how you get people to buy Girl Scout cookies.

ALYSSA: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: OK.

ALYSSA: You have to be smart because it's really hard work to sell cookies.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Right. OK, we can do that. We can be smart. Next one.

ALYSSA: Always be cute...

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: (Laughter).

ALYSSA: ...Because if you be cute, you will - they will love you and give you money and have your cookies.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: (Laughter) OK. So you have to look cute. We're cute. What if someone says, oh, no thank you; I don't want any Girl Scout cookies today? What do you say?

ALYSSA: You say, thank you for listening. And then we'll walk away because you always have to be friendly, not mean.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: So you say, OK, well, thank you anyways. Thanks for listening. I think that's a good approach, too. Will you tell people where they can donate to NPR?

ALYSSA: Donate.npr.org/planetmoney.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Thank you so much.

ALYSSA: Thank you.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

There is an old quote about artists from Paul Gardner, himself an artist. He said, a painting is never finished; it simply stops in interesting places, which is exactly what we tell ourselves here at PLANET MONEY as we try and put out two shows a week. Sure, we travel the globe looking for compelling stories about economics, the most fascinating characters we can find. And we beg, beg for time to tell the story. We'd spend years working on each one. But there are deadlines. There shows to put out. And so we end each story. And even as we're pushing the send button - or, you know, however podcasts get up there, which I'm still not sure about - but even at that moment, we feel like the podcast isn't really finished. It's just hopefully stopping in one of those interesting places.

Well, today, on our yearly update show, we're going back to those places, and we're going to tell you what happened after we turned off our microphones. It is an annual tradition we have named after the catchphrase of my favorite old-timey radio reporter, Paul Harvey. We call it "The Rest Of The Story," or, the way he put it...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PAUL HARVEY: The rest of the story.

SMITH: 2019.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith. Today on the show, we will check in on the vast mail delivery conspiracy known popularly as the Universal Postal Union. We'll find out what happened to that plane that got stuck in Iran. And we'll do the numbers on how much that mattress mogul lost betting on baseball. Interesting places just ahead.

Time now for sports. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun (ph).

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Robert Smith, do you remember - it was actually five years ago now...

SMITH: This is Jacob Goldstein speaking.

GOLDSTEIN: ...You and I did a story - it's weird the way you refer to me in the third person when we're sitting right next to each other - about the NCAA, college sports and, specifically, about should college athletes be paid? And even more specifically than that, we talked to Ed O'Bannon. You remember this?

SMITH: I remember this because Ed O'Bannon stumbled upon his own face, right?

GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

SMITH: His own face in a video game.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. He had been, like, a star basketball player at UCLA back in the '90s. And then this was way after that. He's at a friend's house, and his friend is like, I just bought a video game with you in it. And then Ed O'Bannon starts watching himself in a video game.

SMITH: So weird.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. He told us what he thought when he heard it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

ED O'BANNON: While he was playing, you know, my friend, he says, you know, what's crazy about this is, you know, we paid - I don't know - a hundred dollars or whatever for the game, and you didn't see any of it. And you didn't get a dime. And, you know, when he said it, I felt like I had been kicked.

SMITH: Because at the time, people who were amateur athletes - they had signed up for that. They knew they were not going to get paid for actually playing. But this was clearly a use of his image, of his likeness in order to make money for somebody else.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes. And so O'Bannon became the lead plaintiff and, like, the face of this big federal lawsuit, right? And the lawsuit was arguing not that colleges should pay athletes, but just that athletes should be able to get paid to, like, be in video games or endorse shoes or whatever. So that was the story we originally did.

What happened with that case was the athletes sort of won, but not really. In the end, the courts were like, maybe you can get a little more money in scholarships, but basically, no, you can't get a bunch of money from endorsements.

SMITH: This was when?

GOLDSTEIN: 2015 was when the appeals court made that finding. And then this year...

SMITH: Dun, dun, dun (ph).

GOLDSTEIN: ...The California Legislature passed a bill that basically said, starting in 2023 - I guess we say 2023 now - college students in California would be allowed to be paid for name, image and likeness - for this thing that Ed O'Bannon wanted to be able to get paid for. So they passed the bill. And the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, hadn't signed it yet. And he went on this HBO show called "The Shop" to talk about it. And in particular, he was talking about how all the college presidents were calling him on the phone trying to get him not to sign the bill, to veto the bill.

SMITH: Not to do it.

GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SHOP")

MAVERICK CARTER: What are they saying?

GAVIN NEWSOM: What the hell are you doing destroying college sports? They're saying, you're destroying the purity of amateurism. Not once did they talk about the needs of these kids.

CARTER: Will they even listen to you? Will they listen to the other...

NEWSOM: They're going to after I sign this because...

(LAUGHTER)

NEWSOM: That's the whole damn point. It's the power arrangement. The minute we sign this, all the sudden, now they have to deal with California.

GOLDSTEIN: And then, Robert, genius PR stunt - I have to give it to him - right there on the show, Newsom signed the bill into law.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE SHOP")

NEWSOM: Now, let's do it, man. All right. It's now law.

SMITH: They are good at show business in California.

GOLDSTEIN: They know what they're doing. They know what they're doing.

SMITH: So do we know what the impact of this is going to be? I mean, is this one of those, like, as goes California, so goes the nation?

GOLDSTEIN: So the NCAA had unsurprisingly lobbied against this bill. They called it unconstitutional. But, you know, pretty much as soon as it became law in California, of course, all these other states, especially big football states, started considering their bills. And a few weeks later, in October of this year, the board of the NCAA voted unanimously that they were going to allow students to benefit from their name, image and likeness.

So we don't know the details, but basically, Ed O'Bannon - he lost in court. But it looks pretty clear that college athletes are going to be able to get paid.

SMITH: And when they make the movie, this is the moment when the slow clap starts.

(APPLAUSE)

GOLDSTEIN: O'Bannon walking back out onto the court at Pauley Pavilion, maybe a little limp, cheering. And then on the Jumbotron, it's him in the video game, then just cash raining down.

SMITH: Jacob Goldstein, thank you very much for the update.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, it's a good one.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Next up, a show that really did end in a mysterious and very interesting place. Picture it, if you will. An American airplane - a 737 Max run by Norwegian Air - parked on a runway in the middle of Iran, stranded, and no one knows what to do about it. That's how our podcast ended, hosted by Karen Duffin, who joins us now.

KAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hello, Robert.

SMITH: So recap for us the problem that this plane had.

DUFFIN: OK, so it's the holidays. People are trying to fly from Dubai to Oslo. But as the plane flies over Iran, there's engine problems and they are forced to ground the plane in Iran. Nobody on that plane had a visa to get into Iran. Everyone's freaking out.

SMITH: But there are solutions to that.

DUFFIN: There are solutions to that. In fact, they got out the very next day. But the plane that they flew in on - that was the bigger problem because this plane needed new engine parts, and it is an American-made engine. And because of U.S. sanctions...

SMITH: Nothing American can be sold to Iran.

DUFFIN: ...Nothing with more than 10% American-made parts could come into Iran.

SMITH: And so there's no real solution because you can't make the parts. You can't get them from any place but America. And international diplomacy and sanctions were keeping this plane where it was. So that's how the podcast ended. What's your update?

DUFFIN: OK. So what Norwegian Air needed was a waiver on the sanctions from the U.S. Treasury Department, and they were able to get this waiver. And two months later, a Russian cargo plane flew in the parts that they needed to Iran. They fixed the plane. And finally, this plane got out of Iran.

SMITH: So, like, happy ending - like, the plane's out there, you know, like a celebrity plane, and you can pay extra to fly on it and...

DUFFIN: So this plane is a 737 Max - a Boeing 737 Max.

SMITH: Oh, yes.

DUFFIN: Right. You may have heard that...

SMITH: Which, of course, was grounded.

DUFFIN: Yes.

SMITH: So it's not flying. Where is it?

DUFFIN: The plane is currently stuck in Copenhagen until the 737 Maxes resume their flights.

SMITH: Well, I suppose we'll check in on it next year. Thanks, Karen.

DUFFIN: All right. No problem.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KENNY MALONE, BYLINE: Kenny coming in. Kenny coming in. Kenny coming in. Kenny coming in.

SMITH: It is Kenny Malone, who just got back from New Zealand, where he was working on a story. But we're not going to talk about that right now.

MALONE: Yeah, don't spoil that.

SMITH: I'm not going to spoil it. But we're so excited to have you back.

MALONE: Thanks, man. I'm still very jet-lagged, which is my excuse if this segment is not good.

SMITH: No, this segment is going to be great because today's update is based on one of my favorite stories that you did this year. It was from an episode called "Three Bets."

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: And one of the bets was a kind of mystery. It was back in 2017, and someone was placing millions and millions of dollars on the Houston Astros to win the World Series.

MALONE: Yeah, the mystery was these bets were so big they were moving betting markets. Did this person have insider information? Had this person fixed the World Series? No. The answer was somehow even stranger than that, and it began with the man in this video.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JIM MCINGVALE: Hi folks. This is Mattress Mack. If your mattress is older than 10 years old, pick it up and throw it out. Come to Gallery Furniture.

SMITH: And you can't see this on the podcast, but Mattress Mack wears a mattress like a poncho. That is just his couture. He loves to wear an assortment of mattress accessories.

MALONE: Yes. Jim McIngvale owns mattress stores in and around Houston, Texas.

SMITH: People love this there.

MALONE: And we learned that back in 2017, Mattress Mack had run a promotion that got a little out of control. The deal was that if you bought a mattress from him for $3,000 or more, and then the hometown baseball team, the Houston Astros, if they won the World Series...

SMITH: Then you got a full refund.

MALONE: Full refund.

SMITH: Your mattress was free. You could sleep the sleep of a winner.

MALONE: Problem was the Astros were very good that season.

SMITH: Oh, no.

MALONE: And so as the World Series got closer, more and more people bought mattresses - $13 million worth more, Mack told us, than he expected.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

MCINGVALE: Yeah, it was. But, you know, there's always opportunities to hedge in Nevada.

SMITH: Hedge is a technical finance term...

MALONE: Yes.

SMITH: ...Which means you can take the opposite bet of something in order to reduce your losses. And so what he meant is he went to do sports betting.

MALONE: Yes. Mack put millions and millions of dollars on the Houston Astros so that if they won the World Series, he would win a bunch of money, which he could then use to pay out all those mattress refunds he would owe. And that is exactly what happened.

SMITH: Yeah.

MALONE: The promotion had gotten a little bigger than he thought, but he managed to save it by sports betting. And some people, Robert - they might count their blessings and never run a promotion like that again.

SMITH: Yes, but some people wouldn't be wearing a mattress...

MALONE: No.

SMITH: ...Around the city.

MALONE: No one is Mattress Mack but Mattress Mack.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

MCINGVALE: Hi. This is Mack.

MALONE: Hey, Mack. It's Kenny Malone from PLANET MONEY. How are you?

MCINGVALE: Very good. How are you?

MALONE: Good. I heard you had been making some more bets.

MCINGVALE: (Laughter).

MALONE: Mack ran the promotion again this season...

SMITH: Sure.

MALONE: ...And it blew up way bigger this time, in part, Mack says, because one of their best pitchers happened to throw a no-hitter over Labor Day weekend. And why, Robert, do we care about Labor Day weekend?

SMITH: Because if you're going to buy a mattress - come on - that is what the holiday was designed for.

MCINGVALE: Which is the biggest mattress weekend of the year. Suffice it to say (ph), it was quite a promotion.

MALONE: How much money's worth of qualifying mattresses had sold?

MCINGVALE: It was at least, you know, 25 or 30 million.

SMITH: That's a lot of mattresses.

MALONE: Yeah, it was $13 million back in 2017, 30 million this time around. And so he was going to have to hedge a lot more bets this time around. And interestingly, one big change that's happened since 2017 is that a lot of states have legalized sports betting. So Mack spent a good chunk of 2019 not just flying to Las Vegas, but flying all over the country to place big bets.

MCINGVALE: I bet in Las Vegas. I bet in New Jersey. I bet in Mississippi. And, strangely enough, the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Mississippi took more action than any other casino.

MALONE: How much were you able to put at the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Mississippi?

MCINGVALE: Between $7 million and $8 million.

SMITH: So the big drama now in this story is who won the World Series? I literally forgot.

MALONE: Do you not know? Well, OK.

SMITH: No, the Washington Nationals.

MALONE: The Washington Nationals...

SMITH: Yes, of course - big story.

MALONE: ...Beat the Houston Astros. Mack had about $14 million on the Astros. But, of course, it's not just like he loses that money. Because the Astros didn't win the World Series, he doesn't have to pay out that $30 million in rebates. Plus, Mack is pretty famous for this now. He got a lot of press coverage. And so it was a pretty savvy marketing effort in the end as well.

You're probably the most famous sports better in the country at this point.

MCINGVALE: I don't know if that's the title I want, but I certainly - we had a lot of fun doing it, and it's just great to cross the finish line.

MALONE: Robert.

SMITH: Yes.

MALONE: He's doing it again.

(LAUGHTER)

MALONE: He loves it.

SMITH: One of these days, it's not going to work.

MALONE: It's always going to work for Mattress Mack.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Thanks, Kenny.

MALONE: You got it.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: After the break, the rest of "The Rest Of The Story."

There is nothing more boring than the postal system. But that is exactly what they want you to think.

NICK FOUNTAIN, BYLINE: (Laughter).

SMITH: That laughter is Mr. Nick Fountain.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. So you'll remember that in 2018, Kenny and I went and met this guy in New Jersey. His name was Jayme Smaldone. And he makes this, like, travel mug that now we have a bunch of them all over the office.

SMITH: Yeah. This was an amazing mug. And he looks online, and he notices, OK, there are people knocking off my mug in China. But then he looks a little closer, and he sees...

FOUNTAIN: That the price of shipping these mugs...

SMITH: From China.

FOUNTAIN: ...From China to the U.S. is cheaper than him shipping his mug just, like, across the street in New Jersey.

SMITH: Amazing.

FOUNTAIN: And so Jayme Smaldone sent everyone at PLANET MONEY messages on LinkedIn that said, there is this international conspiracy of postal people who are keeping down international postage rates and screwing over my small business.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

JAYME SMALDONE: Look; I realize how it sounds, but it's like, look where we are, right? Like, you're here. I knew that you guys would eventually be here.

FOUNTAIN: And what we discovered in reporting out the show was that, yes, indeed, there is this organization. They're called the Universal Postal Union.

SMITH: He was right.

FOUNTAIN: And they do sort of control the international postage rates. And because of the way they set things up, rates to send packages to the U.S. from China were super low.

SMITH: So that's where we left things off with the story. We uncovered a little bit of the conspiracy. But this podcast that you put out actually changed the world.

FOUNTAIN: Not going to go that far, but Jayme certainly changed the world.

SMALDONE: I think the world is mostly the same. Maybe postal has changed a bit.

FOUNTAIN: (Laughter) OK.

SMALDONE: But I don't know that the entire world has changed all that much.

FOUNTAIN: The world postal system - you're right - has changed a lot. What's happened since we last saw you?

SMALDONE: So the president, about a year ago, put a notice that we were going - the U.S. was going to withdraw from the Universal Postal Union.

FOUNTAIN: Even Jayme was kind of surprised at how bold of a negotiating tactic that was. It made him kind of nervous.

SMALDONE: I was like, oh, boy. I wasn't - I didn't think that was going to happen.

FOUNTAIN: And in response, the Universal Postal Union had a special meeting, and a plan to tweak the rates was proposed.

So were you watching the livestream?

SMALDONE: I watched a bit of it. But it's - you know, as you can imagine, it's - yeah, it's real boring. I'm more of a ESPN highlights - you know, just give me the top plays of the night rather than watch the whole game.

FOUNTAIN: Robert - ESPN highlight version - they worked out a deal. Postage rates going from China to the U.S. are going to double or triple sometimes. And the subsidy is effectively going to be over. So we'll notice this.

I mean, I have very much enjoyed getting cheap stuff sent to me for pretty much nothing - free shipping from China. Are you saying that's probably going to end?

SMALDONE: Oh, 100%. It's over.

FOUNTAIN: Jayme, is this your fault?

(LAUGHTER)

SMALDONE: It was great while it lasted for you, I guess. But, you know, everything comes to an end.

FOUNTAIN: Sure.

And Jayme told me that this whole year has been wild. He's been to D.C., like, a dozen times. And maybe the capstone of all those trips was when he went to a meeting right across the street from the White House. Everyone who is anyone in postal policy was there.

SMALDONE: I met the head of the Universal Postal Union.

FOUNTAIN: No way.

SMALDONE: I swear. I have a picture of the two of us. He's like, who are you? I said, Mighty Mug. And I think he thought, like, oh, no.

(LAUGHTER)

FOUNTAIN: You were strangely obsessed with the mail.

SMALDONE: But guess what. I'm done with it. It's over.

SMITH: Jayme Smaldone - vindicated.

FOUNTAIN: Guy is an American hero.

SMITH: Or a postal union villain, depending on how you look at it. Nick Fountain, thank you very much.

FOUNTAIN: Thanks, Robert.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: You know, we were going to end this show right there, but there is one last, late-breaking update. Kenny Malone comes back into the studio.

MALONE: Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo (ph).

SMITH: What do we got?

MALONE: Since the last time we talked, Mattress Mack...

SMITH: Which was, like, five minutes ago.

MALONE: ...Mattress Mack has changed his mind. He's giving up gambling forever. He realizes the error of his ways.

SMITH: No.

MALONE: And he's done.

SMITH: No. No, that's not it.

MALONE: No, of course that's not it. He'll gamble forever, I think.

SMITH: This is from an episode that you did just a few weeks ago...

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: ...About car repossession.

MALONE: Yes. One of the people we interviewed in this story was a woman named Stephanie Waldrop, who had just had her car repossessed when we talked to her. Very sympathetic story. We learned that she had 10 days to get her car back, or else it would be auctioned off. And after the story ran, tons of people reached out asking how they could help Stephanie. She set up a GoFundMe account, and donations poured in.

SMITH: I'm looking here at it live. It is still going - right? - this GoFundMe page. And there are people here who have given $25, $50, a couple $500 donations to help Stephanie get her car back.

MALONE: Yes. Preeti Varathan, the co-reporter on this story, and I called up Stephanie, and she was shocked by the response.

STEPHANIE WALDROP: So I was sitting there, and I looked at my account. And my boyfriend's in the shower. And I was seeing - like, it showed me how much I had in there. It was $1,900. I just immediately freaked out. I was like, I'm getting my car back. I screamed, and he was probably thinking, what is wrong with you?

MALONE: Stephanie told us that she immediately called her lender and said, do not auction my car; I have the money. And when Preeti and I got on the phone with Stephanie, she had just gotten home from getting the car.

Is there anything you want to say to the listeners who reached out to help?

WALDROP: Absolutely. I want to say thank you. Thank you guys so much. Like, if I could right now, I'd give y'all a hug.

PREETI VARATHAN: Stephanie, you said you got your car an hour ago.

WALDROP: About an hour, hour and a half ago.

VARATHAN: Have you gone for a drive yet?

WALDROP: I have. I drove it all the way back home. It took about a 20-minute drive. It felt so great. It felt so great when I got behind the wheel of my car.

There is an old quote about artists from Paul Gardner, himself an artist. He said, a painting is never finished.

but basically, no, you can't get a bunch of money from endorse.
This was when?
2015 was when the appeals court made that finding.
And then this year, the California legislature passed a bill that basically said starting in 2023,
I guess we say 2023 now, college students in California would be allowed to be paid for name,
image and likeness for this thing that Ed O'Bannon wanted to be able to get paid for.
So they passed the bill and the governor of California, Gavin Newsom, hadn't signed it yet.
And he went on this HBO show called The Shop to talk about it.
And in particular, he was talking about how all the college presidents were calling him on the phone,
trying to get him not to sign the bill, to veto the bill.
Not to do it. Sure.
What are they saying?
What the hell are you doing destroying college sports?
They're saying you're destroying the purity of amateurism.
Not once did they talk about the needs of these kids.
Will they even listen to you? Will they listen to the other side?
They're going after I sign this.
That's the whole damn point. That's the power arrangement.
The minute we sign this, all of a sudden, now they have to deal with California.
And then, Robert, genius PR stunt. I have to give it to him.
Right there on the show, Newsom signed the bill into law.
No.
Let's do it, man.
All right.
They are good at show business in California.
They know what they're doing. They know what they're doing.
So do we know what the impact of this is going to be?
I mean, is this one of those like as goes California, so goes the nation?
So the NCAA had unsurprisingly lobbied against this bill.
They called it unconstitutional.
But, you know, pretty much as soon as it became law in California,
of course, all these other states, especially big football states,
started considering their bills.
And a few weeks later, in October of this year,
the board of the NCAA voted unanimously that they were going to allow students
to benefit from their name, image, and likeness.
So we don't know the details, but basically Ed O'Bannon, he lost in court,
but it looks pretty clear that college athletes are going to be able to get paid.
And when they make the movie, this is the moment when the slow clap starts.
O'Bannon walking back out onto the court at Pauley Pavilion.
Yeah, maybe a little limp.
People cheering.
Put some sands.
And then on this Jumbotron, it's him and the video game,
and then just cash raining down.
Jacob Goldstein, thank you very much for the update.
Yeah, it's a good one.
Next up, a show that really did end in a mysterious and very interesting place.
Picture it, if you will.
An American airplane, a 737 MAX, run by Norwegian Air,
parked on a runway in the middle of Iran,
stranded, and no one knows what to do about it.
That's how our podcast ended, hosted by Karen Duffin, who joins us now.
Hello, Robert.
So recap for us the problem that this plane had.
OK, so it's the holidays.
People are trying to fly from Dubai to Oslo.
But as the plane flies over Iran, there's engine problems
and they are forced to ground the plane in Iran.
Nobody on that plane had a visa to get into Iran.
Everyone's freaking out.
But there are solutions to that.
There are solutions to that.
In fact, they got out the very next day.
But the plane that they flew in on, that was the bigger problem
because this plane needed new engine parts and it is an American-made engine.
And because of U.S. sanctions...
Nothing American can be sold to Iran.
Nothing with more than 10% American-made parts could come into Iran.
And so there's no real solution because you can't make the parts,
you can't get them from any place but America,
and international diplomacy and sanctions were keeping this plane where it was.
So that's how the podcast ended.
What's your update?
OK, so what Norwegian Air needed was a waiver on the sanctions
from the U.S. Treasury Department.
And they were able to get this waiver.
And two months later, a Russian cargo plane flew in the parts that they needed to Iran.
They fixed the plane.
And finally, this plane got out of Iran.
So, like, happy ending.
Like the plane's out there, you know, like a celebrity plane
and you can pay extra to fly on it and...
So this plane is a 737 MAX, a Boeing 737 MAX.
Oh, yes.
Right, you may have heard that.
Which of course was grounded.
Yes.
So it's not flying. Where is it?
This plane is currently stuck in Copenhagen until the 737 MAXs resume their flights.
Well, I suppose we'll check in on it next year.
All right, no problem.
Coming in, Kenny, coming in, Kenny, coming in, Kenny, coming in.
It is Kenny Malone who just got back from New Zealand
where he was working on a story.
But we're not going to talk about that.
Yeah, don't spoil that.
We're not going to spoil it, but we're so excited to have you back.
Thanks, man.
I'm still very jet-lagged, which is my excuse if this segment is not good.
This segment is going to be great because today's update is based on one of my favorite stories that you did this year.
It was from an episode called Three Bets.
And one of the bets was a kind of mystery.
It was back in 2017 and someone was placing millions and millions of dollars on the Houston Astros to win the World Series.
Yeah, the mystery was these bets were so big, they were moving betting markets.
Did this person have insider information?
Had this person fixed the World Series?
No.
The answer was somehow even stranger than that.
And it began with the man in this video.
Hi, folks.
This is Mattress Mack.
If your mattress is older than 10 years old, pick it up and roll it out.
You can't see this on the podcast, but Mattress Mack wears a mattress like a poncho.
That is just his couture.
He loves to wear an assortment of mattress accessories.
Yes, Jim Mackingvale owns mattress stores in and around Houston, Texas.
People love this there.
And we learned that back in 2017, Mattress Mack had run a promotion that got a little out of control.
The deal was that if you bought a mattress from him for $3,000 or more, and then the hometown baseball team, the Houston Astros, if they won the World Series.
Then you got a full refund.
Full refund.
If your mattress was free, you could sleep the sleep of a winner.
Problem was the Astros were very good that season.
And so as the World Series got closer, more and more people bought mattresses.
Thirteen million dollars worth more, Mack told us, than he expected.
Yeah, it was. But, you know, there's always opportunities to hedge in Nevada.
Hedge is a technical finance term, which means you can take the opposite bat of something in order to reduce your losses.
And so what he meant is he went to do sports betting.
Yes, Mack put millions and millions of dollars on the Houston Astros so that if they won the World Series, he would win a bunch of money, which he could then use to pay out all those mattress refunds he would owe.
And that is exactly what happened.
The promotion had gotten a little bigger than he thought, but he managed to save it by sports betting.
And some people, Robert, they might count their blessings and never run a promotion like that again.
Yes, but some people wouldn't be wearing a mattress.
No.
Around the city.
No one is Mattress Mack, but Mattress Mack.
Hi, this is Mack.
Hey, Mack, it's Kenny Malone from Planet Money.
How are you?
Hey, Kenny, how are you?
Good. I heard you had been making some more bets.
Mack ran the promotion again this season, and it blew up way bigger this time.
In part, Mack says, because one of their best pitchers happened to throw a no-hitter over Labor Day weekend.
And why, Robert, do we care about Labor Day weekend?
Because if you're going to buy a mattress, come on.
That is what the holiday was designed for.
Which is the biggest mattress weekend of the year that spiked the sale.
So it was quite a promotion.
How much money's worth of qualifying mattresses had sold?
Oh, it was at least, you know, 25 or 30 million.
Oh, that's a lot of mattresses.
Yeah, it was 13 million dollars back in 2017, 30 million this time around.
And so he was going to have to hedge a lot more bets this time around.
And interestingly, one big change that's happened since 2017 is that a lot of states have legalized sports betting.
So Mack spent a good chunk of 2019 not just flying to Las Vegas, but flying all over the country to place big bets.
I bet in Las Vegas, I bet in New Jersey, I bet in Mississippi.
And strangely enough, the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Mississippi took more action than any other casino.
How much were you able to put at the Scarlet Pearl Casino in Mississippi?
Between seven and eight million dollars.
So the big drama now in this story is who won the World Series? I literally forgot.
Do you not know? Well, okay.
No, the Washington Nationals.
The Washington Nationals beat the Houston Astros.
Mack had about 14 million dollars on the Astros.
But of course, it's not just like he loses that money because the Astros didn't win the World Series.
He doesn't have to pay out that 30 million dollars in rebates.
Plus, Mack is pretty famous for this now.
He got a lot of press coverage.
And so it was a pretty savvy marketing effort in the end as well.
You're probably the most famous sports bettor in the country at this point.
I don't know if that's the title I want, but I certainly...
We had a lot of fun doing it and it didn't quite cross the finish line.
Robert.
Yes?
He's doing it again.
He loves it.
One of these days, it's not going to work.
It's always going to work for Mattress Mack.
Thanks, Kenny.
You got it.
After the break, the rest of the rest of the story.
The Indicator is a little show that tells big stories about the economy.
In just 10 minutes, we tackle important topics like unemployment, the housing market, and how Justin Bieber saved the Icelandic economy.
That happened.
NPR's The Indicator from Planet Money.
Listen now.
There is nothing more boring than the postal system.
But that is exactly what they want you to think.
That laughter is Mr. Nick Fountain.
You remember that in 2018, Kenny and I went and met this guy in New Jersey.
His name was Jamie Small-Done.
He makes this travel mug that now we have a bunch of them all over the office.
This was an amazing mug.
He looks online and he notices, okay, there are people knocking off my mug in China.
But then he looks a little closer and he sees that the price of shipping these mugs from China to the U.S.
is cheaper than him shipping his mug just like across the street in New Jersey.
Amazing.
And so Jamie Small-Done sent everyone at Planet Money messages on LinkedIn that said,
there is this international conspiracy of postal people who are keeping down international postage rates and screwing over my small business.
Look, I realize how it sounds, but it's like, look, look where we are.
Right? Like you're here.
I knew that you guys would eventually be here.
And what we discovered in reporting out the show was that, yes, indeed, there is this organization.
They're called the Universal Postal Union.
It was right.
And they do sort of control the international postage rates.
And because of the way they set things up, rates to send packages to the U.S. from China were super low.
So that's where we left things off with the story.
We covered a little bit of the conspiracy, but this podcast that you put out actually changed the world.
Not going to go that far, but Jamie certainly changed the world.
I think the world is mostly the same.
Maybe postal has changed a bit.
But I don't know that the entire world has changed all that much.
The world postal system, you're right, has changed a lot.
What's happened since we last saw you?
So the president about a year ago put in notice that the U.S. was going to withdraw from the Universal Postal Union.
Even Jamie was kind of surprised at how bold of a negotiating tactic that was.
It made him kind of nervous.
I was like, oh, boy, I wasn't.
I didn't think that was going to happen.
And in response, the Universal Postal Union had a special meeting and a plan to tweak the rates was proposed.
So were you watching the live stream?
I watched a bit of it, but it's, you know, as you can imagine, it's it's it's.
Yeah, it's real boring.
It's more of a ESPN highlights.
You know, just give me the top plays of the night rather than watch the whole game.
Robert ESPN highlight version.
They worked out a deal.
Postage rates going from China to the U.S. are going to double or triple sometimes.
And the subsidy is effectively going to be over.
So we'll notice this.
I mean, I have very much enjoyed getting cheap stuff sent to me for pretty much nothing.
Free shipping from China.
Are you saying that's probably going to end?
100 percent. It's over.
Jamie, is this your fault?
It was great while it lasted for you, I guess.
But, you know, everything comes to an end.
Sure.
And Jamie told me that this whole year has been wild.
He's been to D.C. like a dozen times.
And maybe the capstone of all those trips was when he went to a meeting right across the street from the White House.
Everyone who was anyone in postal policy was there.
I met the head of the Universal Postal Union.
No way.
I swear. I have a picture of the two of us.
He's like, who are you?
I said, Mighty Mug.
And I think he felt like, oh, no.
You were strangely obsessed with the mail.
But guess what?
I'm done with it.
It's over.
Jamie Smallstone, vindicated.
Guy is an American hero.
Or a postal union villain, depending on how you look at it.
Nick Croughton, thank you very much.
Thanks, Robert.
You know, we were going to end this show right there, but there is one last late breaking update.
Kenny Malone comes back into the studio.
What do we got?
Since the last time we talked, Mattress Mack.
Which was like five minutes ago.
Mattress Mack has changed his mind.
He's giving up gambling forever.
He realizes the error of his ways.
And he's done.
No, that's not it.
No, of course that's not it.
He'll gamble forever, I think.
This is from an episode that you did just a few weeks ago about car repossession.
Yes.
One of the people we interviewed in this story was a woman named Stephanie Waldrop who had just had her car repossessed when we talked to her.
Very sympathetic story.
We learned that she had 10 days to get her car back or else it would be auctioned off.
And after the story ran, tons of people reached out asking how they could help Stephanie.
She set up a GoFundMe account and donations poured in.
I'm looking here at a live.
It is still going, right?
This GoFundMe page.
And there are people who have given $25, $50, a couple of $500 donations to help Stephanie get her car back.
Yes.
Preeti Varathon, the co-reporter on this story, and I called up Stephanie and she was shocked by the response.
So I was sitting there and I looked at my account and my boyfriend's in the shower.
And I was seeing, it was like, it showed me how much I had in there was $1,900.
I just immediately freaked out.
I was like, I'm getting my car!
I screamed it.
He was probably thinking, what is wrong?
Stephanie told us that she immediately called her lender and said, do not auction my car.
I have the money.
And when Preeti and I got on the phone with Stephanie, she had just gotten home from getting the car.
Is there anything you want to say to the listeners who reached out to help?
Absolutely.
I want to say thank you.
Thank you guys so much.
Like, if I could right now, I'd give y'all hugs.
Stephanie, you said you got your car an hour ago.
About an hour, hour and a half ago.
Have you gone for a drive yet?
I have.
I drove it all the way back home.
It took about 20 minutes drive.
Oh, it felt so great.
It felt so great when I got behind the wheel of my car.
As always, we would love to hear from you.
