(SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING)

KEITH ROMER, HOST:

Hey.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

Look at Keith Romer. You brought your running clothes.

ROMER: I'm here. I'm ready.

MALONE: Give me a time check. What do you got?

ROMER: 9:03 a.m.

MALONE: All right, so 9:03 a.m. in New York City, which means it is 9:03 p.m. in Wuhan, China, where, currently, the Wuhan Open tennis tournament is going on. There's one match left. We still have time to place sports bets.

ROMER: We are in New York City, where it is illegal to make a sports bet on your phone. However, we are at the George Washington Bridge. And on the other side of that bridge, New Jersey - gambler's paradise.

MALONE: Off we go, Keith.

ROMER: OK.

MALONE: Come on. Keith, come on.

ROMER: You're, like, a decade younger than me.

MALONE: Keith, you know I've been doing this for about a year, right?

ROMER: Running across the bridge?

MALONE: Yeah, to place sports bets from time to time.

ROMER: OK.

MALONE: This is Jersey. Jersey enough?

ROMER: Yeah, we're under a bridge.

MALONE: Under a bridge.

ROMER: How much more Jersey do you want to be?

MALONE: Concrete.

ROMER: Yeah.

MALONE: Exhaust, people commuting to somewhere else. All right, here we go.

ROMER: Yeah.

MALONE: We've got Sloane Stephens versus Petra...

ROMER: Kvitova.

MALONE: ...Kvitova. I - like, I've definitely heard Sloane Stephens. She's an American tennis player. I've seen her play before. She's awesome.

ROMER: What's the sweet spot?

MALONE: I'm going to type in - 50 feels like too much.

ROMER: But this is for our listeners.

MALONE: No, 50 is making me anxious.

ROMER: OK.

MALONE: Fifteen - 15 feels good.

ROMER: OK, 15.

MALONE: Are you not sure?

ROMER: No, it's your money. I don't care what you do.

MALONE: Processing, processing - bet placed. Good luck.

ROMER: All right, you want to watch it?

MALONE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it on my phone.

ROMER: That's Petra Kvitova. That's who you just bet against.

MALONE: That's Kvitova?

ROMER: That's who you bet against.

MALONE: She's, like, 6'3", man.

ROMER: Yeah. Just watch her serve. This is the serve that you bet against.

MALONE: Oh, no.

ROMER: And we're 20 minutes later now, and it appears that that was a bad bet.

MALONE: This isn't even close.

ROMER: No.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED SPORTS COMMENTATOR #1: Petra's been playing so well.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED SPORTS COMMENTATOR #2: Petra Kvitova.

ROMER: Match - Kvitova.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED SPORTS COMMENTATOR #2: As the two-time Wuhan champion has herself a spot...

MALONE: She's the returning Wuhan champion?

ROMER: (Laughter) Two-time Wuhan champion. Do your research, Kenny Malone.

MALONE: Oh.

ROMER: You just ran to New Jersey to give away $15 to a giant casino corporation.

(SOUNDBITE OF CHRIS JONES' "CHATROOM ROMANCE")

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

ROMER: And I'm Keith Romer. Today on the show, three stories about three sports bets, all of which are better than the one Kenny Malone just made.

MALONE: It was a bad sports bet.

ROMER: Want to run back?

MALONE: Did you know that whole time that Kvitova was that much better?

ROMER: Yeah.

MALONE: Why didn't you say something?

ROMER: I think you seemed so - you know, I didn't - I don't know. It was kind of fun. Come on, Kenny. You're not going to get your money back by running faster, Malone.

Sports betting, as Kenny learned the hard way, is about having as much information as possible before you bet.

MALONE: Or having friends who will share information with you, but, sure, go on.

ROMER: So tennis sports betters, unlike Kenny, have found this way to maximize the information they get. Do you want to know the secret?

MALONE: Yeah.

ROMER: You physically go to the match.

MALONE: Oh, like, be there live, in person.

ROMER: Right. Because if you are at home watching on TV, there's a delay.

MALONE: OK.

ROMER: You have to wait for, like, the umpire to press the button to get the score in. But if you are there live, you know before everybody else. And so gamblers actually hire people to go to matches. They're called courtsiders. And I heard about them from this tennis journalist Ben Rothenberg.

BEN ROTHENBERG: If you're a courtsider, you go to a tennis match. You sit there, and you push a button each time someone wins a point. If Player A wins the point, you press one button. If Player B wins the point, you press another button.

MALONE: So are you telling me that it is somebody's job to fly around the world and watch tennis matches and then, like, press a button on their phone? That's - that is a job somebody could have?

ROMER: Right. You are in Monaco one week. You're in Madrid the next week...

MALONE: Come on.

ROMER: ...Florida.

MALONE: What are we doing in radio?

ROMER: OK, so Ben says there is a downside to this job, which is that tennis officials do not like anything that has to do with gambling.

MALONE: Does it feel icky? Is it like...

ROMER: They make this kind of slippery slope argument where, today, maybe you're just sending off scores. Tomorrow, maybe you're, like, offering a player a bribe to take a dive.

MALONE: Wow, that seems like quite a slope, but OK.

ROMER: So what has developed is this kind of cat-and-mouse game, right? On one side, you've got the courtsiders sitting in the stands, trying to, like, send their updates. And on the other side, you've got the officials from the tennis tournament trying to stop them.

ROTHENBERG: So at any given tournament and any given match, there will be people who are called spotters who are surveying the crowd with binoculars, walking around, taking looks, looking at their book of faces of people that have been apprehended or who are known courtsiders and matching people up.

ROMER: So Ben was at this tournament in Charleston, and he actually saw one of these courtsiders getting taken out by the security guards.

MALONE: No.

ROTHENBERG: And they had sort of pinned him to the ground. And I noticed that he had a wig that had fallen off.

ROMER: His wig - what kind of a wig was it? Like, a long hair...

MALONE: He said it was just, like, some cheap Halloween wig. Like, it was obviously - like, once it came off, the jig was up.

ROTHENBERG: Tennis has some odd characters, but even by those standards, that was pretty strange.

ROMER: What is interesting to me about what's going on here - it used to be the way you made money if you were a tennis association was you sold broadcasting rights.

MALONE: Yeah.

ROMER: But then a few years ago, they figured out, hey, we can sell the score data, right? We can sell 40-15, 40-30, deuce, right? We can sell that on to gambling websites, to news sites.

MALONE: OK, and if I'm running a gambling website, I'm sort of obligated to do that, otherwise my thing isn't going to work.

ROMER: Exactly. But the courtsiders then are in direct competition with that stream of data. They're pirating the data, the tennis organization would argue.

MALONE: Right.

ROTHENBERG: And it's a strange thing from a free speech point of view, honestly. Here's a legal question. I mean, if I'm at a match and talking to you on the phone while I'm at the match and say, hey, Nadal is up 2-1 in the first set, I can't imagine that I'm breaking any rule by doing that. But the tennis data rights police would say that you were.

ROMER: In fact, they say it right on the ticket. If you go to the U.S. Open, the fine print on your ticket says something about how you are not allowed to transmit information for gambling purposes. If they catch you courtsiding, they kick you out. If you come back, they will charge you with trespassing.

ROTHENBERG: It's the same as the casino that kicks people out for counting cards. Counting cards is not against the law, but it is against the house rules of the casino. And tennis tournaments have that same kind of casino ethos when it comes to courtsiders.

(SOUNDBITE OF INGO MOELL SONG, "CHAIN REACTION")

MALONE: OK, Keith, story No. 2. This is, I guess, technically also a story about information and sports gambling, only this time, it is about gamblers not having all of the information.

ROMER: I'm interested.

MALONE: It is a story about a casino mystery, and I heard about it from my sister's husband's brother. It's complicated. Don't worry about it.

Do you just want to introduce yourself so I've got that on tape?

JAMES HOLZHAUER: James Holzhauer, professional sports gambler, Las Vegas, Nev.

MALONE: All right, so when does this story start? Do we start this in 2017, I guess?

HOLZHAUER: Yeah. You know, I had a bunch of bets.

MALONE: So it's 2017 World Series, Keith.

ROMER: Houston Astros...

MALONE: Yup. LA Dodgers.

ROMER: Dodgers, sure.

MALONE: And, you know, James is a professional sports gambler. He is watching the betting markets when he notices one day that, like, whoa, it looks like at one casino, like, a bunch of money was just bet on the Houston Astros.

HOLZHAUER: Your first thought is, OK, someone knows something I don't, you know?

MALONE: He's wondering, like, I don't - is there, like, a star player who just got injured or something?

HOLZHAUER: But, you know, I check. Nothing seems to be going on.

MALONE: He's like, weird. But a little time passes, and then the same thing happens at a different casino - bunch of money on the Astros - and then another casino, and another casino. And it happens, like, through the whole day.

ROMER: And this is not normal.

MALONE: No.

HOLZHAUER: You know, it's like there's someone going around to different casinos betting huge amounts on one side. And I'm kind of like, what's the deal here, you know?

MALONE: Like, this was this mystery among professional sports gamblers. Like, why would someone be going casino to casino without seemingly any new information placing giant bets on the Astros?

ROMER: Is this the part where you're going to tell me the answer?

MALONE: I mean, yeah.

ROMER: Nice.

MALONE: The answer begins with one of the greatest YouTube videos I have ever seen. Can I show it to you?

ROMER: Yeah.

MALONE: OK.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JIM MCINGVALE: Hi folks. This is Mattress Mack. If your mattress is older than 10 years old, pick it up and throw it out. Come to Gallery Furniture.

MALONE: Keith's making a funny face.

ROMER: So there is a man wearing a mattress. Like, literally, instead of, like, a guy in a barrel, it's a guy in a mattress.

MALONE: Yeah.

ROMER: And he is selling mattresses, I gather.

MALONE: Yes. This is a man named Jim McIngvale, aka, Keith, Mattress Mack.

ROMER: That's a great name.

MCINGVALE: Hi, this is Mack.

MALONE: Hey, Mack. It's Kenny Malone.

ROMER: Is there - do we have a solution to the mystery of why he's wearing a mattress?

MALONE: That is - of course.

Who started calling you Mattress Mack?

MCINGVALE: Myself.

MALONE: When did you start that?

MCINGVALE: There was a guy in the '50s in Texas who was in the tower business. And his tower business was floundering, so he decided to start wearing a tie around his shoulder to his waist every day. When he went and took his kids to school and he went to PTA meetings, he became known as the tower man and he got rich. So I figured I'd try the same thing with mattresses.

MALONE: And it seems to have worked. His furniture chain is, like, quite large in Texas, and people know Mattress Mack. Like, he is a famous figure in Texas.

ROMER: So, OK. What does this have to do with the Las Vegas thing?

MALONE: Yeah, OK. So 2017, the beginning of the baseball season, Mack decided to run a promotion.

MCINGVALE: The pitch is if you buy a mattress $3,000 or better and the Astros win it all, you get your mattress free.

MALONE: OK, so $3,000 mattress or more, and if the Astros win the World Series, you - it's yours. You get to keep the mattress, I'll give you a refund.

MCINGVALE: Yeah, I can't say World Series because it's a trademarked name.

MALONE: Sure.

MCINGVALE: But if the Astros win it all.

ROMER: But the Astros are really good. Like, that was - that's an actual risk. Like, that could've happened.

MALONE: Totally fair. And so Mack was like, I knew that was a possibility. So he took out an insurance policy, about $4 million of coverage.

ROMER: Is that enough?

MALONE: Well, so the season starts, and people start buying mattresses - $3 million worth, $4 million worth.

ROMER: Oh, no.

MALONE: The Astros are really good. They keep doing better. People keep buying mattresses.

MCINGVALE: It was a lot. And then we kept it going right till the World Series started, and we got up to 13 million.

MALONE: That seems higher. I mean, you were insured for about 4 million, you think. So 13 million seems like maybe more than you had bargained for.

MCINGVALE: Yeah, it was. But, you know, there's always opportunities to hedge in Nevada.

MALONE: Do you understand what he's saying when he says that?

ROMER: Yeah. Right, that he would go to Las Vegas and that, I guess, he would bet for the Astros, right?

MALONE: Right. So what he knows he can do is go to the sports market, and if he places a huge bet on the Astros, he has balanced out his bet. Like, if the Astros end up winning the World Series, yes, he's going to have to pay out all those mattresses, but he will then get a bunch of money back from the betting market. And that is why the betting market was, like, moving at each casino over the course of the day. It was Mack, wearing an Astros jersey, placing massive bets.

Are you willing to share at all how much they would take or how much you were able to put down?

MCINGVALE: Game 7 - probably a million five or something like that.

MALONE: Spread out over, like - what? - four or five casinos, was it?

MCINGVALE: Yeah.

MALONE: Yeah.

MCINGVALE: Yeah.

MALONE: That's a lot of money.

MCINGVALE: It is.

MALONE: Are you walking up to these casinos with, like, a suitcase full of, like, cash? Is that how this is working?

MCINGVALE: No, I wire the money out there before I go out there.

MALONE: All right. I was hoping it would be, like, "Ocean's Eleven"-style.

MCINGVALE: Carrying a suitcase full of cash is very dangerous, so I don't want to do that.

MALONE: Well, sure, but it's also very cool.

MCINGVALE: Yeah.

MALONE: Mack had, in fact, been doing this over the course of the entire playoffs. This just happened to be the biggest one.

ROMER: That's kind of brilliant. So what ends up happening? Who wins the bet?

MALONE: The Astros win, so he has to give out all of these refunds, and he's actually sort of happy about this, honestly, because it's like he gets money from the betting and the insurance. And in the end, Mack says he really only had to pay out of pocket for, like, $2 million or $3 million worth of those refunds. That's not bad.

MCINGVALE: No, not bad for all the customers that were happy and thrilled. And we had a refund party a month or six weeks after the World Series.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

MALONE: Oh, go ahead. Do you need to take the call?

MCINGVALE: Yeah, hold on a sec.

MALONE: Sure.

MCINGVALE: Yeah, Larry (ph).

MALONE: The Astros, by the way, competitive this year in baseball. He's doing it again.

ROMER: No.

MALONE: Yep.

ROMER: Mattress Mack.

MALONE: Mattress Mack knows what's up.

ROMER: Don't you ever learn?

(SOUNDBITE OF DAN STEIN'S "CAVALRY CHARGE")

MALONE: After the break, Keith Romer is out.

ROMER: See you.

MALONE: Ben Johnson from the Endless Thread podcast is in to talk about a whole new world of other kinds of bets.

OK, so for this third story, we have a kind of gamble in the esports world, arguably. But weirdly, it is not clear if it is a gamble, and that's sort of the entire point. People can't figure out if this particular thing is like gambling. And here to help me talk about this is Ben Johnson from the Endless Thread podcast. Ben.

BEN JOHNSON: Kenny, how are you?

MALONE: Thanks for bringing me video games.

JOHNSON: Let's game.

MALONE: Does this count as sports?

JOHNSON: Yeah.

MALONE: It's, like, a stretch.

JOHNSON: Esports.

MALONE: It's all right.

JOHNSON: OK, so we're going to show you this thing that people can't agree about. But to do it, Kenny and I are going to need to actually, like, step into a video game for a second, but we're also going to have help.

MALONE: Yes.

JOHNSON: Kenny, you down?

MALONE: Full-on, yes.

JOHNSON: Let's do this.

MALONE: Boop, boop, boop. Oh, woo. All right, Owen (ph).

OWEN: All right.

MALONE: Your dad is the editor of PLANET MONEY.

OWEN: Yep.

MALONE: How old are you? You're 13, 15?

OWEN: Fourteen.

MALONE: Fourteen. We're watching your stream right now. And what are we watching?

OWEN: "Overwatch."

MALONE: Right, so pause for a second, I guess, Owen.

OWEN: OK.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

JOHNSON: There's the loot box.

OWEN: Yeah.

MALONE: Owen, how would you describe what this box looks like?

OWEN: Just a glowing box. It looks futuristic, definitely. It has something that comes out of it. I don't know what. You only see when you open it. Two boxes is $2. Five boxes is $5. Eleven boxes is $10.

MALONE: What is inside of this thing?

OWEN: Basically, just clothes or, like, sprays which you can put on walls, like, inside the game. Yeah. You can get voices out of it that say, like, phrases.

MALONE: Open it now.

OWEN: All right.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

OWEN: Yep, got a skin.

MALONE: Yeah.

JOHNSON: Yeah.

OWEN: Yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, "OVERWATCH")

DARIN DE PAUL: (As Reinhardt) Catchphrase.

MALONE: It literally will just say catchphrase?

OWEN: Yep.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO GAME, "OVERWATCH")

DE PAUL: (As Reinhardt) Catchphrase.

MALONE: I kind of like that.

JOHNSON: Enjoy those Loot Crates, man.

OWEN: All right.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

OWEN: Bye. Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

MALONE: So that is a Loot Crate or a loot box. And that is the thing people cannot seem to agree about.

JOHNSON: That's right.

MALONE: We are going to define this as basically a, like, box in a video game that you can pay real money to get that gives you stuff for the video game - virtual stuff.

JOHNSON: Yeah, but you don't know what it is until you open the loot box.

MALONE: Mystery boxes.

JOHNSON: Yes.

MALONE: Very exciting.

JOHNSON: Loot boxes are actually a fundamental revenue model of all kinds of games now, right? This has been happening over the last 10 years or so. And it's not just how these games make any real money. It's actually how they also keep making real money from their users. Loot boxes are supposed to be a $50 billion piece of the overall video game industry in the next three years.

MALONE: And these are present in, like, every kind of game you could possibly imagine, everything from, like, "FIFA World Cup" soccer all the way to, like, a "Star Wars" game that infamously included them back in 2017.

JOHNSON: Yep, "Battlefront II." And now, it would be one thing if the only people doing this quasi-gambling by buying loot boxes were grown-ups. But if we're talking about video games, a lot of the people playing these games are kids like Owen.

MALONE: And, like, look; whatever you think about whether gambling is good or not, like, there seems to be some consensus around the idea that, like, maybe kids should not be the ones doing the gambling. Here, for example, is U.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who made this angry Twitter video about loot boxes.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOSH HAWLEY: This needs to stop. They need to be upfront about what their games are actually doing, and they need to stop practices that intentionally exploit children.

MALONE: Who among us hasn't made an angry Twitter video about loot boxes?

JOHNSON: (Laughter) Hawley has actually introduced a bill that would ban the sale of loot boxes to children because, kids, gambling is, yes, bad. But is it gambling?

MALONE: That is the question.

JOHNSON: And so to answer this question, I called somebody up. She knows a lot about gambling, but she maintains she is not a gambler.

LIA NOWER: I'm not a dopamine rush kind of girl. I'm way too cautious and nerdy and numbers-oriented for that.

MALONE: This is Lia Nower, and she is the director of the Center for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University.

NOWER: Gambling is basically betting money on an outcome of random chance. So there is a variable outcome. You're willing to put up money with the hope that you're going to win more, but you may lose all your money.

MALONE: So, like, by that definition, it's a little hard to say because, like, Loot Crates - yeah, they take real money. But then it's not like you're looking to win more money. You're just sort of buying this random array of, like, virtual stuff.

JOHNSON: Virtual stuff, yeah. And Lia says a better question might be about whether opening loot boxes feels like gambling. She actually did a study about the overlap between gamblers and gamers.

NOWER: Almost half - I think, like, 46% - of those who played video games also bought loot boxes. And among the loot box players, they were significantly more likely to also have gambling problems and/or problems with video gaming.

MALONE: The study found that a lot of people who are drawn to loot boxes are also drawn to gambling. But she told you, Ben, that, like, it is not clear-cut exactly whether these are gambling.

JOHNSON: I was really hoping you'd give me either a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, but you seem to be wagging your thumb somewhere in the middle here.

NOWER: Yeah, because there's no agreement on this - not among scholars, not among regulators. Somebody in a position of regulatory or legislative authority has got to really clearly start to define these boundaries.

JOHNSON: In the U.S., that still hasn't happened. Remember the senator with the angry Twitter video? He has introduced a bill that would ban the sale of loot boxes to children. But that bill hasn't really gone anywhere yet. In other parts of the world, laws are getting passed.

MALONE: So for example, in Belgium, Belgium's gambling commission shut down three pretty big games, and they threatened these companies that make these games five years in prison and 80,000 euro fine if they kept offering their loot boxes.

JOHNSON: And also, in Australia, they're talking about making loot box games essentially rated R, so 18-plus.

MALONE: It does feel a little bit like handing children a little virtual slot machine that takes real money. I mean, if we're being honest, that is sort of what they feel like.

JOHNSON: It totally feels like that. And, Kenny, in this international regulatory malaise, shall we say, gaming companies are starting to self-regulate. They're changing the way that they put loot boxes into their games. They're also looking at whether or not kids under 18 should be buying loot boxes and starting to change that as well.

MALONE: But for now, at least, in the United States, the people who get to decide whether loot boxes are OK are just like everybody who plays video games, people like our editor's son Owen.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

MALONE: So, Owen, can I ask you a question?

OWEN: Yep.

MALONE: Do you think that a loot box is like gambling?

OWEN: Yep. You want to buy more? Are you addicted to opening loot boxes already?

MALONE: Yeah. And do we have your dad's credit card?

OWEN: Yep.

MALONE: Well, let's just spend - let's buy 50 of them.

OWEN: Fifty of them?

MALONE: Dad's credit card.

OWEN: OK.

(SOUNDBITE OF "OVERWATCH" SOUND EFFECT)

MALONE: Got it. Yeah, do another one.

OWEN: All right.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Look at Keith Roemer.
Brett, you're running close.
I'm here. I'm ready.
Give me a time check. What do you got?
9.03 a.m.
Alright, so 9.03 a.m. in New York City,
which means it is 9.03 p.m. in Wuhan, China,
where currently the Wuhan Open Tennis Tournament is going on.
There's one match left.
We still have time to place a sports bet.
We are in New York City,
where it is illegal to make a sports bet on your phone.
However, we are at the George Washington Bridge
and on the other side of that bridge,
New Jersey.
Gambor's paradise.
Off we go, Keith.
Okay.
Come on.
Keith, come on.
You're like a decade younger than me.
Keith, you know I've been doing this for about a year, right?
The running across the bridge?
Yeah, to play sports bets from time to time.
Okay.
This is Jersey.
Jersey enough.
Yeah, we're under a bridge.
Under a bridge.
How much more Jersey do you want to be?
Concrete.
Yeah.
Exhaust.
People commuting to somewhere else.
Alright, here we go.
Yeah.
We've got Sloan Stevens versus Petra...
Kvitova.
Kvitova.
I've definitely heard of Sloan Stevens.
She's an American tennis player.
I've seen her play before.
She's awesome.
What's the sweet spot?
I'm going to type in 50.
50 feels like too much.
But this is for our listeners.
No, 50 is making me anxious.
Okay.
15.
15 feels good.
Okay, 15.
Are you not sure?
No, it's your money.
I don't care what you do.
Processing, processing.
Bet placed.
Good luck.
Alright, you want to watch it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, get on my phone.
That's Petra Kvitova.
That's who you just bet against.
That's Kvitova?
That's who you bet against.
She's like 6-3, man.
Yeah, watch her serve.
This is the serve that you bet against.
Oh, no.
And we're 20 minutes later now,
and it appears that that was a bad bet.
This isn't even close.
No.
Petra's been...
Match Kvitova.
As the two-time Wuhan champion, has herself a spot...
She's the returning Wuhan champion?
The two-time Wuhan champion.
Do your research, Kenny Malone.
You just ran to New Jersey to give away $15
to a giant casino corporation.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Kenny Malone.
And I'm Keith Rover.
Today on the show, three stories about three sports bets,
all of which are better than the one Kenny Malone just made.
That was a bad sports bet.
Want to run back?
Did you know that whole time that Kvitova was that much better?
Yeah.
Why didn't you say something?
I think you seemed so, you know, I didn't...
I don't know, it's kind of fun to...
You're hoping to get...
Come on, Kenny.
We're not going to get your money back
by running faster, Malone!

Sports betting, as Kenny learned the hard way,
is about having as much information as possible before you bet.
Or having friends who will share information with you,
but sure, go on.
So tennis sports bettors, unlike Kenny,
have found this way to maximize the information they get.
Do you want to know the secret?
Yeah.
You physically go to the match.
Oh, like be there live in person.
Right, because if you were at home watching on TV,
there's a delay, you have to wait for the umpire
to press the button to get the score in.
But if you are there live, you know before everybody else.
And so gamblers actually hire people to go to matches.
They're called courtsiders.
And I heard about them
from this tennis journalist, Ben Rothenberg.
If you're a courtsider, you go to a tennis match,
you sit there and you push a button each time,
so one wins a point.
If player A wins the point, you press one button.
If player B wins the point, you press another button.
So are you telling me that it is somebody's job
to fly around the world and watch tennis matches
and then like press a button on their phone?
That is a job somebody could have?
Right, you are in Monaco one week,
you're in Madrid the next week.
Come on.
What are we doing in radio?
Okay, so Ben says there is a downside to this job,
which is that tennis officials do not like anything
that has to do with gambling.
Does it feel icky?
They make this kind of slippery slope argument
where today maybe you're just sending off scores,
tomorrow maybe you're like offering a play
or a bribe to take a dive.
Wow, that seems like quite a slope, but okay.
So what has developed is this kind of cat and mouse game,
right, on one side you've got the courtsiders
sitting in the stands trying to like send their updates,
and on the other side you've got the officials
from the tennis tournament trying to stop them.
So at any given tournament, at any given match,
there will be people who are called spotters
who are surveying the crowd with binoculars,
walking around, taking looks,
looking at their book of faces
that people have been apprehended
or who are known courtsiders and matching people up.
So Ben was at this tournament in Charleston
and he actually saw one of these courtsiders
getting taken out by the security guards.
No.
And they had sort of pinned him to the ground
and I noticed that he had a wig that had fallen off.
His wig?
What kind of a wig was it?
It was like a long hair.
He said it was just like some cheap Halloween wig.
Like it was obviously, like once it came off,
sort of the jig was up.
Tennis has some odd characters,
but even by those standards, that was pretty strange.
What is interesting to me about what's going on here,
it used to be the way you made money
if you were a tennis association
was you sold broadcasting rights.
Yeah.
But then a few years ago, they figured out,
hey, we can sell the score data, right?
We can sell 40-15, 40-30 dues, right?
We can sell that on to gambling websites,
to news sites.
Okay, and if I'm running a gambling website,
I'm sort of obligated to do that.
Otherwise my thing isn't gonna work.
Exactly.
But the courtsiders then are in direct competition
with that stream of data.
They're pirating the data
the tennis organization would argue.
Right.
And it's a strange thing from a free speech point of view,
honestly, in terms of legal question.
I mean, if I'm at a match
and talking to you on the phone while I'm at the match
and say, hey, Nadal's up 2-1 in the first set,
I can't imagine that I'm breaking any rule by doing that.
But the tennis data rights police
would say that you were.
In fact, they say it right on the ticket.
If you go to the US Open,
the fine print on your ticket
says something about how you are not allowed
to transmit information for gambling purposes.
If they catch you courtsiding, they kick you out.
If you come back, they will charge you with trespassing.
It's the same as a casino
that kicks people out for counting cards.
Counting cards is not against the law,
but it is against the house rules,
the casino and tennis tournaments
to have that same kind of casino ethos
when it comes to courtsiders.
Okay, Keith, story number two.
This is, I guess, technically also a story
about information and sports gambling.
Only this time it is about gamblers
not having all of the information.
I'm interested.
It is a story about a casino mystery
and I heard about it from my sister's husband's brother.
It's complicated, don't worry about it.
Do you just wanna introduce yourself
so I've got that on tape?
James Holtzauer, professional sports gambler,
Las Vegas, Nevada.
All right, so when does this story start?
Do we start this in 2017, I guess?
Yeah, you know, I had a bunch of bets.
So it's 2017, World Series, Keith.
Houston Astros.
Dodgers, Dodgers, sure.
And you know, James is a professional sports gambler.
He is watching the betting markets
when he notices one day that like, whoa,
it looks like at one casino,
like a bunch of money was just bet on the Houston Astros.
Your first thought is,
okay, someone knows something I don't.
He's wondering like,
is there like a star player
who just got injured or something?
But you know, I check, nothing seems to be going on.
He's like weird, but a little time passes.
And then the same thing happens at a different casino,
bunch of money on the Astros.
And then another casino and another casino.
And it happens like through the whole day.
And this is not normal.
No.
You know, it's like there's someone going around
to different casinos, betting huge amounts on one side.
And I'm kind of like, what's the deal here, you know?
So.
Like this was this mystery
among professional sports gamblers.
Like, why would someone be going casino to casino
without seemingly any new information
placing giant bets on the Astros?
Is this the part where you're gonna tell me the answer?
I mean, yeah.
Nice.
The answer begins with one of the greatest YouTube videos
I have ever seen.
Can I show it to you?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hi folks, this is Mattress Mac.
If your mattress is older than 10 years old,
pick it up and roll it out.
Come to Gallery Furniture, get yourself a-
Keith's making a funny face.
So there is a man wearing a mattress.
Like literally, instead of like a guy in a barrel,
it's a guy in a mattress and he is selling mattresses,
I gather?
Yes.
This is a man named Jim McIngvale,
AKA Keith, Mattress Mac.
That's a great name.
Hi, it's Mac.
Hey, Mac, it's-
Is there, do we have a solution to the mystery
of why he's wearing a mattress?
That is, of course we do.
Who started calling you Mattress Mac?
Myself.
When did you start that?
There was a guy in the 50s in Texas
who was in the tire business,
in his tire business of ploundering.
So he decided to start wearing a tire
around his shoulder to his waist every day
when he went to, took his kids to school
and went to PTA meeting
and became known as a tire man and he got rich.
So I figured I'd try the same thing with mattresses.
And it seems to have worked.
His furniture chain is like quite large in Texas
and people know Mattress Mac.
Like he is a famous figure in Texas.
So, okay, what does this have to do
with the Las Vegas thing?
Yeah, okay.
So, 2017, the beginning of the baseball season.
Mac decided to run a promotion.
The pitch is you buy a mattress, $3,000 or better
and the Astros win it all and you get your mattress free.
Okay, so $3,000 mattress or more.
And if the Astros win the World Series, it's yours.
You get to keep the mattress,
we'll give you a refund.
Yeah, I can't say World Series
because it's a trademark name but if the Astros win it all.
But the Astros were really good.
That's an actual risk.
That could have happened.
Totally fair.
And so Mac was like, I knew that was a possibility.
So took out an insurance policy.
About $4 million of coverage.
Is that enough?
Well, so the season starts
and people start buying mattresses.
$3 million worth, $4 million worth.
Oh no.
The Astros are really good.
They keep doing better.
People keep buying mattresses.
It was a lot and then we kept it going
right till the World Series started
and we got up to 13 million.
I mean, you were insured for about 4 million, you think.
So 13 million seems like maybe more than you had bargained for.
Yeah, it was but you know,
there's always opportunities to hedge in Nevada.
Do you understand what he's saying when he says that?
Yeah, right.
That he would go to Las Vegas
and bet, I guess he would bet for the Astros, right?
So what he knows he can do is go to the sports market
and if he places a huge bet on the Astros,
he has balanced out his bet.
Like if the Astros end up winning the World Series,
yes, he's going to have to pay out all those mattresses
but he will then get a bunch of money back
from the betting market.
And that is why the betting market was like moving
at each casino over the course of the day.
It was Mac wearing an Astros jersey placing massive bets.
Are you willing to share at all how much they would take
or how much you were able to put down?
Game seven, probably a million five
or something like that.
Spread out over like what four or five casinos was it?
Yeah, yeah.
That's a lot of money.
It is.
Are you walking up to these casinos
with like a suitcase full of like cash?
Is that how this is working?
No, I wire the money out there before I go out there.
Oh, great.
I was hoping it'd be like Ocean's Eleven style.
Carrying a suitcase full of cash is very dangerous.
Well sure, but it's also very cool.
Mac had in fact been doing this over the course
of the entire playoffs.
This just happened to be the biggest one.
It's kind of brilliant.
So what ends up happening?
Who wins the bet?
The Astros win.
So he has to give out all of these refunds.
And he's actually sort of happy about this honestly
because it's like he gets money from the betting
and the insurance and in the end, Mac says,
he really only had to pay out of pocket
for like two or $3 million worth of those refunds.
That's not bad.
No, not bad for all the customers
that were happy and thrilled.
And we had a refund party a month
or six weeks after the World Series.
Oh, go ahead.
Do you need to take the call?
Yeah, hold on a second.
Sure.
Yeah, Larry.
The Astros by the way, competitive this year in baseball.
He's doing it again.
No.
Yep.
Mattress Mac.
Mattress Mac knows what's up.
Don't you ever learn.
After the break, Keith Romer is out.
See ya.

Hey everyone, I'm Cardiff Garcia,
co-host of The Indicator, Planet Money's daily podcast.
This week, we look at probiotics.
Why are these unregulated supplements
flying off the shelves when their benefits
are so hotly debated by doctors and scientists?
Hear more on The Indicator from Planet Money
for your daily economics news.
Okay, so for this third story,
we have a kind of gamble in the e-sports world, arguably,
but weirdly, it is not clear if it is a gamble,
and that's sort of the entire point.
People can't figure out if this particular thing
is like gambling.
And here to help me talk about this
is Ben Johnson from the Endless Thread Podcast.
Ben.
Kenny, how are you?
Thanks for bringing me video games.
Let's game.
Is this kind of sports?
Yeah, it's like a stretch.
E-sports.
It's all right.
Okay, so we're gonna show you this thing
that people can't agree about,
but to do it, Kenny and I are going to need
to actually like step into a video game for a second,
but we're also gonna have help.
Yes.
Kenny, you down?
Full on, yes.
Let's do this.
Broop, broop, broop.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
All right, Owen.
All right.
Your dad is the editor of Planet Money.
Yep.
How old are you?
You're 13?
14. 15.
14.
We're watching your stream right now.
What are we watching?
Overwatch.
All right, so pause for a second, I guess, Owen.
Okay.
That's the loot box.
Yeah.
Owen, how would you describe what this box looks like?
Just a glowing box.
It looks futuristic, definitely.
It has something that comes out of it.
I don't know what.
You only see when you open it.
Two boxes is $2.
Five boxes is $5.
11 boxes is $10.
What is inside of this thing?
Basically, just clothes or like sprays,
which you can put on walls, like inside the game.
Yeah, you can get voices out of it
that say like phrases.
Open it now.
All right.
Yep, got a skin.
Yeah.
Catchphrase.
You literally will just say catchphrase?
Yep.
Catchphrase.
I kind of like that.
Enjoy those loot crates, man.
All right, bye, thank you.
So that is a loot crate or a loot box,
and that is the thing people
cannot seem to agree about.
That's right.
We are going to define this as basically
a like box in a video game
that you can pay real money to get
that gives you stuff for the video game, virtual stuff.
Yeah, but you don't know what it is
until you open the loot box.
Mystery boxes, very exciting.
Loot boxes are actually a fundamental revenue model
of all kinds of games now, right?
This has been happening over the last 10 years or so,
and it's not just how these games make any real money,
it's actually how they also keep making real money
from their users.
Loot boxes are supposed to be a $50 billion piece
of the overall video game industry
in the next three years.
And these are present in like every kind of game
you could possibly imagine.
Everything from like FIFA World Cup Soccer
all the way to like a Star Wars game
that infamously included them back in 2017.
Yep, Battlefront 2.
And now it would be one thing
if the only people doing this quasi gambling
by buying loot boxes were grownups,
but if we're talking about video games,
a lot of the people playing these games
are kids like Owen.
And like, look, whatever you think
about whether gambling is good or not,
like there seems to be some consensus
around the idea that like maybe kids
should not be the ones doing the gambling.
Here, for example, is US Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri
who made this angry Twitter video about loot boxes.
This needs to stop.
They need to be upfront about what their games
are actually doing,
and they need to stop practices
that intentionally exploit children.
Who among us hasn't made an angry Twitter video
about loot boxes?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hawley has actually introduced a bill
that would ban the sale of loot boxes to children
because kids gambling is, yes, bad,
but is it gambling?
That is the question.
And so to answer this question,
I called somebody up, she knows a lot about gambling,
but she maintains she is not a gambler.
I'm not a dopamine rush kind of girl.
I'm way too cautious and nerdy
and numbers-oriented for that.
This is Leah Nowher,
and she is the Director of the Center
for Gambling Studies at Rutgers University.
Gambling is basically betting money
on an outcome of random chance.
So there's a variable outcome.
You're willing to put up money
with the hope that you're gonna win more,
but you may lose all your money.
So by that definition, it's a little hard to say
because loot crates, yeah, they take real money,
but then it's not like you're looking to win more money.
You're just sort of buying this random array
of virtual stuff.
Virtual stuff, yeah.
And Leah says a better question might be
about whether opening loot boxes feels like gambling.
She actually did a study about the overlap
between gamblers and gamers.
Almost half, I think like 46% of those
who played video games also bought loot boxes.
And among the loot box players,
they were significantly more likely
to also have gambling problems
and or problems with video gaming.
The study found that a lot of people
who are drawn to loot boxes
are also drawn to gambling.
But she told you, Ben,
that it is not clear cut exactly
whether these are gambling.
I was really hoping you'd give me either a thumbs up
or a thumbs down,
but you seem to be wagging your thumb
somewhere in the middle here.
Yeah, because there's no agreement on this,
not among scholars, not among regulators.
Somebody in a position of regulatory
or legislative authority has got to really clearly
start to define these boundaries.
In the U.S., that still hasn't happened.
Remember the senator with the angry Twitter video?
He has introduced a bill that would ban the sale
of loot boxes to children.
But that bill hasn't really gone anywhere yet.
In other parts of the world, laws are getting passed.
So for example, in Belgium,
Belgium's gambling commission
shut down three pretty big games
and they threatened these companies
that make these games five years in prison
and 80,000 euro fines
if they kept offering their loot boxes.
And also in Australia,
they're talking about making loot box games
essentially rated R, so 18 plus.
It does feel a little bit
like handing children a little virtual slot machine
that takes real money.
I mean, if we're being honest,
that is sort of what they feel like.
It totally feels like that.
And Kenny, in this international regulatory malaise,
shall we say, gaming companies
are starting to self-regulate.
They're changing the way
that they put loot boxes into their games.
They're also looking at whether or not kids under 18
should be buying loot boxes
and starting to change that as well.
But for now, at least, in the United States,
the people who get to decide whether loot boxes are okay
are just like everybody who plays video games.
People like our editor's son, Owen.
So, Owen, can I ask you a question?
Yep.
Do you think that a loot box is like gambling?
Yep.
You wanna buy more?
Are you addicted to opening loot boxes already?
And do we have your dad's credit card?
Yep.
Let's just spend, let's buy 50 of them.
50 of them?
Dad's credit card.
Okay.
Got it.
Yeah, do another one.
All right.
