Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren wants to tackle inequality by implementing a wealth tax on ultra-millionares. 2% for households with $50 million dollars or more and 3% for households with $1 billion or more.

She's not alone. Back in June, 20 really rich people signed an open letter calling for a wealth tax on people like them.

Income taxes are the norm for the U.S. federal government. A wealth tax would be new. But they've been tried in Europe, and they largely failed.

Today on the show, we talk to zillionares and economists and ask: Can a wealth tax really work?

Some numbers in this episode come from polls by Politico and CNBC.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

GREG ROSALSKY, HOST:

What were you doing in Alaska?

NICK HANAUER: I was on my boat with my wife and another couple in the Misty Fjords.

ROSALSKY: And what kind of boat was this?

HANAUER: I have a big boat.

ROSALSKY: Is it like a yacht?

HANAUER: I think you would call it a yacht.

ROSALSKY: Nick Hanauer is rich.

Do you have a helipad on your yacht?

HANAUER: No, no, no.

ROSALSKY: OK.

ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:

Nick may have a modest yacht, but he could probably afford one with a helipad. He comes from a rich family, a family of pillow tycoons.

HANAUER: We turned a very small pillow company into one of the nation's largest pillow companies over time.

ROSALSKY: It's called Pacific Coast Feather Company. The family sold it a few years back. But while he still worked there, Nick started helping them sell their pillows on the Internet.

HANAUER: And it was absolutely clear in 1992 to me that physical retail was essentially going to be dead. And as luck would have it, I had a friend who shared that view. His name was Jeff Bezos.

ROSALSKY: And how did you meet Jeff Bezos, just out of curiosity?

HANAUER: He was dating one of my closest and oldest friends. And I was lucky enough to be the first investor in Amazon.com, and that led to other things. And before you know it, I was a full-time technology venture capitalist.

GHAZI: He started a company called aQuantive, which he eventually sold to Microsoft for $6.4 billion. He then invested in a bank with some friends and - you get the point. He's a capitalist. But not the like, Scrooge McDuck, Gordon Gekko, I'm-an-oil-man-style capitalist. He's also a philanthropist and got involved in politics.

HANAUER: And, you know, my theory of change in the early days was that all of the big challenges that America faced with rising inequality and poverty could be solved if you just had a successful enough education system.

ROSALSKY: Around 2007, he says, he began to realize that the problem was bigger than just schools.

HANAUER: The education system is not failing people. It's the economic system that's failing people.

ROSALSKY: The wealthy - specifically, the top 1% or the top 0.01% - were getting richer way faster than everyone else. And that scared Hanauer.

HANAUER: If this trend continues, people are going to revolt. History shows that that level of inequality results in either a police state or a revolution or both.

GHAZI: He saw a future where a tiny few had everything; a kind of feudal world that had to end in violent revolution. So to be clear, this wasn't just about do-gooding. He was worried about himself and his friends, you know, being punished somehow or, maybe, guillotined or something.

ROSALSKY: Anyway, being a zillionaire, he began to use his position to ring the alarm. And he bankrolled new causes, like a higher minimum wage.

GHAZI: He got so worried, he even gave a TED talk.

HANAUER: So in 2012, I gave a TED talk on economic inequality that got me thrown out of TED. Like, it was so controversial that we - that they asked me not to come back.

ROSALSKY: Yeah. So the video of his lecture got taken down. But since then, he's kind of become known for talking about inequality, especially this one line he has.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HANAUER: So what do I see in our future today you ask? I see pitchforks - as in angry mobs with pitchforks.

(SOUNDBITE OF BERTRAND ALLAGNAT'S "PANIC AT VERSAILLES")

ROSALSKY: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Greg Rosalsky.

GHAZI: And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

The wealth gap in the U.S. has gotten so big that even yacht-cruising zillionaires are getting uncomfortable, turning on their own kind and demanding change. It's high-class warfare.

ROSALSKY: Today on the show, a new idea to redistribute wealth in America.

GHAZI: Its pitchforks versus pitch decks, torches versus Porsches.

ROSALSKY: The angry villagers are coming, and they have the data.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROSALSKY: The last time inequality in the United States was as bad as it is today was during the Roaring '20s. We're talking "The Great Gatsby" - flappers and fedoras, prohibition. And then came the Great Depression. It obliterated fortunes and then led to major changes in how we regulate capitalism.

GHAZI: Elizabeth Warren, running for president, crusader against big money and wealth inequality, recently proposed one solution to this century's wealth gap. Here she is on the campaign trail.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ELIZABETH WARREN: We can pay for it. I've got a way. The Ultra-Millionaire's Tax.

(CHEERING)

GHAZI: And the Ultra-Millionaire Tax is a pretty new idea for the United States.

ROSALSKY: It is, actually. That's because it's a wealth tax not an income tax. Traditionally, if you wanted to tax the wealthy in America, you - for the most part, you tax income. It's been that way for, like, a hundred years.

GHAZI: And the income tax is progressive, meaning the more you make, the more you pay. And the old political debate focused on how much more the rich should pay.

ROSALSKY: But when it comes to inequality, it's really wealth more than income that matters. These two things often get conflated, but they're actually different. Income is what you make every year. It's like a running faucet.

GHAZI: Wealth is what you own - the money in your bank, your house, your car, your shares of Microsoft, if you have stock. It's like a reservoir. So Jeff Bezos, for example - he has a formal salary of less than $100,000 a year; not crazy high - about the same as a typical school principal.

ROSALSKY: But he's worth - at least before his divorce - about $120 billion. The thing that makes him rich is not his income. It's really, mostly, his stock in Amazon. And unless he sells it, he's not taxed on it. It just grows and grows. Nick Hanauer thinks this is crazy.

HANAUER: The reason that wealth is concentrating so much is that I can grow my assets for 40 years untaxed.

ROSALSKY: And if you don't have wealth, you, obviously, don't have anything just sitting there growing and growing.

GHAZI: What Warren is saying is she wants the federal government to tap the reservoir of wealth. She wants to tax wealth at 2% over $50 million and 3% over a billion. That means for every dollar you have over 50 million, you're paying two cents a year, and three cents on every dollar over a billion. That doesn't really sound like a lot, but maybe you're not thinking like a billionaire because really rich people think a lot about growth.

ROSALSKY: There are different estimates, but it's kind of safe to say that wealth grows, on average, about 6- or 7- or 8% over the long run.

GHAZI: Every year - and then it's growth on the growth, growing 7%, over and over again like a snowball - compound growth. With this plan, if the returns stay on track, the rich will still get richer but, like, half as fast.

ROSALSKY: So in a sense, 3% is kind of high.

GHAZI: Now, we haven't really taxed wealth in this country. I mean, we kind of do with the property tax, but that's state and local not federal. And it usually only applies to real estate. It's basically a wealth tax that taxes only one form of wealth.

ROSALSKY: And there is the estate tax, which is basically a one-time wealth tax, but the rich person you're taxing has to die first.

GHAZI: What Warren is proposing is the federal government count up the value of all the rich people's stuff and tax it every single year. We're talking diamond rings, jet skis...

ROSALSKY: Normal skis...

GHAZI: ...Fancy tchotchkes...

ROSALSKY: ...Maseratis...

GHAZI: ...Giacommettis.

ROSALSKY: What is that?

GHAZI: They're statues for rich people.

ROSALSKY: Well, you know, as you might expect, a lot of rich people - they don't love the idea of a wealth tax.

GHAZI: Here, for instance, is Frappuccino magnate and former presidential candidate Howard Schultz on NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

HOWARD SCHULTZ: When I see Elizabeth Warren come out with, you know, a ridiculous plan of taxing wealthy people...

ROSALSKY: So the founder of Starbucks hates it.

SCHULTZ: I mean, you can't just attack these things in a punitive way by punishing people.

ROSALSKY: So do a bunch of other rich people.

GHAZI: But not all of them - Nick Hanauer, the early Amazon investor - he isn't the only one-percenter jumping yacht.

LIESEL PRITZKER SIMMONS: I got born really lucky.

ROSALSKY: This is Liesel Pritzker Simmons. She's a former child actress. You might have seen her in "Little Princess" or "Air Force One." She's honestly great in the movies, but that's not how she made her money.

PRITZKER SIMMONS: My family had a number of different businesses. But the one that they are best known for is Hyatt Hotels.

GHAZI: Liesel and her husband Ian - also rich - say they have been thinking about the wealth tax for a while now. But it wasn't until Warren's plan that they saw real numbers. And they thought, yeah. This could be a good thing.

PRITZKER SIMMONS: This is a relatively moderate tax on a fair amount of wealth that could go to public use, you know, better than it sitting, you know, in our art collections.

ROSALSKY: They thought it was time to send a message from rich America to the rest of America - guys, it's cool. We're down with the wealth tax. So they started calling their rich friends; among them, George Soros, billionaire investor...

GHAZI: Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook...

ROSALSKY: ...Abigail Disney, you could probably guess where that money comes from...

GHAZI: ...and Nick Hanauer.

ROSALSKY: In the end, they got 18 other zillionaires to sign this letter. And, actually, we have the letter here.

GHAZI: They actually published it on Medium, which is a blog site.

ROSALSKY: But we printed it out. And it's called “An Open Letter To The 2020 Presidential Candidates: It’s Time To Tax Us More.” That kind of captures it, but there's some other things that got in here - an American flag looking - billowing in the sun.

GHAZI: Oh, that's really billowing and beautiful. OK. They basically lay out everything they say a wealth tax could help pay for. They say it could help address the climate crisis...

ROSALSKY: America's aging infrastructure...

GHAZI: ...Childcare costs...

ROSALSKY: ...Public health challenges, like the opioid epidemic.

GHAZI: They say it's fair, patriotic.

ROSALSKY: The basic gist of this letter is this - Elizabeth Warren's specific proposal says it's going to raise like $2.75 trillion over 10 years. And these zillionaires are saying, that's a lot of money that we could use to fix America's problems.

And taxing wealth in this way is increasingly popular. There are a few polls that show a clear majority of Americans support it - like, three-quarters of them. Even a majority of millionaires say they support this policy.

GHAZI: But there is a caveat. Wealth taxes have been tried before in other countries. And their track record?

SARAH PERRET: I would say, in general, it hasn't been great.

GHAZI: After the break - when wealth taxes go wrong.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROSALSKY: A wealth tax - it may be new for the U.S. federal government. But actually, wealth taxes, they've been tried before.

PERRET: They actually used to be quite popular in European countries.

GHAZI: This is Sarah Perret. She's an economist at the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. She did a study about wealth taxes and how they worked out. She says in 1990, there were 12 countries in Europe that had a wealth tax. Today there are only three.

PERRET: And so the trend has really been to repeal them.

ROSALSKY: Perret says wealth taxes failed for a bunch of reasons. First, they were tough on people who looked rich on paper but were, in fact, short on the cash needed to pay the tax. An example...

PERRET: The typical one that comes to mind is an old lady who retired a long time ago.

ROSALSKY: This lady, Perret says, has a house and jewelry and a bunch of other assets that make her look rich to the government. But really, she only has a small pension, and it's hard for her to come up with the money to pay the wealth tax.

GHAZI: Another problem with the wealth tax - it was pretty expensive to track and value rich people's stuff every year.

PERRET: It's more complicated than an income tax, for example, or a property tax where you're just taxing one type of asset. So here, you're taxing all types of assets.

GHAZI: Some assets are pretty easy to value, like stocks or bonds. But others, like paintings or your grandma's engagement ring or your rare ocelot or your rare savannah cat...

ROSALSKY: Ostriches...

GHAZI: ...Or your alpaca farm.

ROSALSKY: ...Tigers.

GHAZI: So the government is going to have to figure out a way to assess the value of all of that, which means bureaucracy - more accountants, tax collectors, calculators, spreadsheets, the whole nine yards.

ROSALSKY: Third issue - exemptions. Countries wouldn't tax all kinds of assets. So like, in France, for example, they didn't tax artwork or antiques. The logic was like, why waste money figuring out what these things are worth? Other countries exempted business assets, things like factories, machines and other things that, like, create jobs and help the economy.

GHAZI: And all those exemptions created a bunch of problems. There was less money coming in because all those assets weren't being taxed. The people with the best accountants and lawyers gamed the system, which made it unfair. Plus, it created incentives for people to put their money in quirky, weird places, like artwork or antiques.

ROSALSKY: Which is great for artists and antique dealers - but not for the economy as a whole. And of course, rich people tried to protect their money by getting it out of the country. There is a term for this.

PERRET: Capital flight.

GHAZI: Capital flight. Like, rich people who couldn't figure out another way to evade taxes would sometimes just pick up and move. Like, for example, a ton of millionaires left France and moved right across the border to Belgium. And poof - no more wealth tax. Or they'd find some tax shelter, like in Monaco or the Cayman Islands or something - also not good for the economy.

ROSALSKY: So in the end, the policy didn't even raise much money. Like, it didn't do what it was supposed to do. So back to Warren. Her camp argues they specifically designed their proposal with Europe's failures in mind. Warren's proposal, it really only taxes the very, very rich - those with over $50 million in wealth.

GHAZI: That's only about 75,000 families in the United States. In Europe, the threshold was much lower - in some cases, around a million dollars or even less - not the ultra-rich, but the sort of rich. So under Warren's plan, that old lady with the fancy house and the nice jewels, she's going to be just fine, not rich enough to get taxed.

ROSALSKY: Plus, the proposal says, very clearly - no exemptions - none, zero, zilch, nada.

GHAZI: But what about my sports car?

ROSALSKY: No - yeah, that's going to be taxed.

GHAZI: How about my pet tiger?

ROSALSKY: Tigers will definitely be taxed.

GHAZI: My musket collection.

ROSALSKY: How rich are you, Alexi?

GHAZI: Faberge eggs?

ROSALSKY: None of that.

GHAZI: But no exemptions means the IRS is going to have to get bigger and way better at tracking rich people's stuff every year. They're going to have to value those Faberge eggs and Birkin bags and pet tigers. Have you ever had to value a tiger? Well, the IRS is going to have to have a tiger guy now. Plus, the gold leash - how much are those anyway? I don't know.

ROSALSKY: To many people, this sounds like a lot. But Nick Hanauer, he doesn't think it's a big deal at all.

HANAUER: You hire 300 IRS agents - they cost $200,000 apiece - just focus on nothing but this problem. That costs $60 million against literally hundreds of billions of dollars in potential income. I mean, it's cheap to do.

ROSALSKY: And he says this valuation problem, you know, figuring out how much your tiger is worth - this can be solved.

HANAUER: There's a very, very, very simple way to handle this, which is you get to write down all of your assets and pick a number. And then the government has the right to buy any of those assets at the price that you pick.

ROSALSKY: This self-valuation method, by the way, it is kind of brilliant. I mean, think about it. If you try to save money by undervaluing your stuff, you're going to lose it. And I mean, this is obviously going to be a tough sell in the United States. But let's say the government is able to do something like that; that still leaves the issue of capital flight.

GHAZI: But U.S. citizens can't just move to another country to avoid taxes. The U.S. taxes its citizens wherever they are in the world. So tax evaders would have to renounce their citizenship to legally avoid the wealth tax. And if you're a rich person who renounces your citizenship, Warren proposes the federal government confiscate 40% of your wealth over a billion dollars.

(WHISTLING)

GHAZI: Wow. You're a suspiciously good whistler.

ROSALSKY: Thanks.

GHAZI: But there's another big problem - the U.S. Constitution. It makes it hard for the federal government to directly tax people. A hundred years ago, it took a constitutional amendment to institute the income tax. There are some legal scholars who argue we'd need another amendment for a wealth tax. And that would be a huge hurdle to jump.

ROSALSKY: But if you support taxing the wealthy more and this constitutional issue ends up being a problem, there might actually be good news. Sarah Perret's study concludes you can deal with wealth inequality without a wealth tax.

PERRET: Our study finds that, in general, a combination of broad-based taxes on personal capital income - so taxes on dividends, capital gains, interest - as well as well-designed inheritance taxes might be a more effective way of addressing wealth inequality without some of the negative sides of wealth taxes.

ROSALSKY: And in fact, in many countries in Europe where wealth inequality is not quite as bad as it is in the United States, this strategy seems to be working.

GHAZI: But it wouldn't touch many of today's huge fortunes for decades. Lots of billionaires are pretty young. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, he was only born in 1984. An inheritance or an estate tax might not affect his wealth for, like, 50 or 60 or 70 years depending on whatever bionic implants he might be able to get. I mean, he could live forever.

ROSALSKY: Literally forever. If we have the technology in the next 50 years to, like, upload his consciousness into the cloud...

GHAZI: Just floating in our phones all the time.

ROSALSKY: ...We'll never be able to tax him. And look. If you really want to destroy wealth inequality - to actually roll it back - a wealth tax of 3% isn't really going to cut it. Again, wealth grows at like 6 or 7 or 8% per year, on average. That letter that Nick and Liesel signed, it calls specifically for a, quote, "moderate wealth tax."

And so we were curious. Like, when does it stop being moderate? How much are these zillionaires really willing to pay to stop the pitchforks?

GHAZI: So we asked Nick Hanauer, that yacht-owning venture capitalist who riled up so many of his fellow one-percenters - when does the wealth tax stop being moderate and when would he stop supporting it?

HANAUER: Oh, that's a super good question, and it's something I haven't thought carefully about. So a moderate - to me, a moderate wealth tax simply slows the growth of large pools of assets. And so a 2% tax on that or a 3% tax on that slows the growth rate from, let's say, 8% to 5%, which means you're still getting a ton richer than everyone else in the country. If you take the growth rate to zero, that's no longer moderate. And I guess, that begins to test even my comfort with a wealth tax.

GHAZI: So perhaps unsurprisingly, Hanauer has limits - tax enough to slow the growth, not so much you stop the growth.

ROSALSKY: But he's still out there agitating amongst his fellow zillionaires. In fact, after we got off the phone with him, he said he was headed to Edinburgh to give a speech about wealth inequality. And he's still pushing for a wealth tax.

GHAZI: A moderate wealth tax.

She's honestly great in the movies, but that's not how she made her money
Uh my family
Uh had a number of different businesses, uh, but the one that they are best known for is hyatt hotels
Liesel and her husband ian also rich say they have been thinking about the wealth tax for a while now
But it wasn't until warren's plan that they saw real numbers and they thought
Yeah
This could be a good thing
This is a relatively moderate tax on on a fair amount of wealth
That could go to public use, you know better than it sitting, you know in our in our art collections
They thought it was time to send a message from rich america to the rest of america guys. It's cool
We're down with the wealth tax. So they started calling the rich friends among them
George soros billionaire investor chris hughes one of the founders of facebook abigail disney
You could probably guess where that money comes from and nick hannower
In the end they got 18 other zillionaires to sign this letter and actually we have the letter here
They actually publish it on medium, which is a blog site, but we we printed it out and it's called
Uh an open letter to the 2020 presidential candidates. It's time to tax us more that kind of captures it
But there's some other things they got in here
Um stuff american flag looking
Oh looking great billowing in the sun
Okay, they basically lay out everything they say a wealth tax could help pay for they say it could help address the climate crisis
America's aging infrastructure child care costs public health challenges like the opioid epidemic
They say it's fair patriotic
The basic gist of this letter is this elizabeth warren's specific proposal says it's going to raise like
2.75 trillion dollars over 10 years and these zillionaires are saying
That's a lot of money that we could use to fix america's problems
And taxing wealth in this way is increasingly popular
There are a few polls that show a clear majority of americans support it like three quarters of them
Even a majority of millionaires say they support this policy
but
There is a caveat
Wealth taxes have been tried before in other countries and their track record. I would say in general
Um, it hasn't been great
After the break
when wealth taxes

A wealth tax it may be new for the u.s federal government, but actually wealth taxes. They've been tried before
They actually used to be quite popular in european countries. This is sarah peray
She's an economist at the organization of economic cooperation and development or oecd
She did a study about wealth taxes and how they worked out
She says in 1990 there were 12 countries in europe that had a wealth tax
Today there are only three and so the trend has really been to repeal them
Perry says wealth taxes failed for a bunch of reasons
First they were tough on people who looked rich on paper
But were in fact short on the cash needed to pay the tax an example the typical one that comes to mind is an old
lady who
Retired a long time ago
This lady praises has a house and jewelry and a bunch of other assets that make her look rich to the government
But really she only has a small pension and it's hard for her to come up with the money to pay the wealth tax
Another problem with the wealth tax it was pretty expensive to track and value rich people's stuff every year
It's more complicated
Than an income tax for example or a property tax where you're just taxing one type of asset
So here you're taxing all types of assets
Some assets are pretty easy to value like stocks or bonds
But others like paintings or your grandma's engagement ring
Or your rare ocelot or your rare savannah cat ostriches
Or your alpaca farm tigers
So the government is going to have to figure out a way to assess the value of all of that which means
Bureaucracy more accountants tax collectors calculators spreadsheets the whole nine yards
third issue
exemptions
Countries wouldn't tax all kinds of assets. So like in france, for example
They didn't tax artwork or antiques the logic was like why waste money figuring out what these things are worth
Other countries exempted business assets things like factories machines and other things that like create jobs and help the economy
And all those exemptions created a bunch of problems
There was less money coming in because all those assets weren't being taxed
The people with the best accountants and lawyers gamed the system which made it unfair
Plus it created incentives for people to put their money in quirky weird places like artwork or antiques
Which is great for artists and antique dealers, but not for the economy as a whole
And of course rich people tried to protect their money by getting it out of the country
There is a term for this capital flight
Capital flight like rich people who couldn't figure out another way to evade taxes would sometimes just pick up and move
Like for example a ton of millionaires left france and moved right across the border to belgium and poof
No more wealth tax or they'd find some tax shelter like in monaco or the cayman islands or something
Also, not good for the economy. So in the end the policy didn't even raise much money
Like it didn't do what it was supposed to do
So back to warren her camp argues they specifically design their proposal with europe's failures in mind
Warren's proposal it really only taxes the very very rich those with over 50 million dollars in wealth
That's only about
75,000 families in the united states in europe the threshold was much lower in some cases around a million dollars or even less
Not the ultra rich, but the sort of rich
So under warren's plan that old lady with the fancy house and the nice jewels. She's going to be just fine
Not rich enough to get taxed plus the proposal says very clearly
No exemptions none zero zilch nada
But what about my sports car no, yeah, that's gonna be that's gonna be taxed
How about my pet tiger tigers will definitely be taxed my musket collection. How rich are you alexi faberge eggs?
none of that
But no exemptions means the irs is gonna have to get bigger and way better at tracking rich people's stuff every year
They're gonna have to value those faberge eggs and burkin bags and pet tigers
Have you ever had to value a tiger?
Well, the irs is gonna have to have a tiger guy now plus the gold leash. How much are those?
Anyway, I don't know to many people this sounds like a lot but nick hannauer
He doesn't think it's a big deal at all. You hire 300 irs agents
They cost two hundred thousand dollars a piece to focus on nothing
But this problem that costs 60 million dollars against
Literally hundreds of billions of dollars in potential income
I mean it's cheap to do and he says this valuation problem, you know figuring out how much your tiger is worth
This can be solved. There's a very very very simple way to handle this
Which is you get to write down all of your assets and pick a number
And then the government has the right to buy any of those assets at the price that you pick
This self-valuation method by the way, it is kind of brilliant
I mean think about it if you try to save money by under valuing your stuff
You're gonna lose it and I mean this is obviously going to be a tough sell in the united states
But let's say the government is able to do something like that. That still leaves the issue of capital flight
But us citizens can't just move to another country to avoid taxes
The us taxes its citizens wherever they are in the world
So tax evaders would have to renounce their citizenship to legally avoid the wealth tax
And if you're a rich person who renounces your citizenship
Warren proposes the federal government confiscate 40 percent of your wealth over a billion dollars
Well, you're you're a suspiciously good whistler
Thanks, but there's another big problem the u.s
Constitution it makes it hard for the federal government to directly tax people
A hundred years ago. It took a constitutional amendment to institute the income tax
There are some legal scholars who argue we'd need another amendment for a wealth tax
And that would be a huge hurdle to jump
But if you support taxing the wealthy more and this constitutional issue ends up being a problem
There might actually be good news
Sarah prays study concludes you can deal with wealth inequality without a wealth tax
Our study finds that in general a combination
Of broad-based taxes on personal capital income. So taxes on dividends capital gains interest
As well as well-designed inheritance taxes might be a more effective way of addressing wealth inequality without some of the negative sides of wealth taxes
And in fact in many countries in europe where wealth inequality is not quite as bad as it is in the united states
This strategy seems to be working
But it wouldn't touch many of today's huge fortunes for decades
Lots of billionaires are pretty young mark zuckerberg, for example
He was only born in 1984 an inheritance or an estate tax might not affect his wealth for like
50 or 60 or 70 years depending on whatever bionic implants he might be able to get
I mean he could live forever literally forever if we have the technology in the next 50 years to like upload
His consciousness into the cloud just floating in our phones all the time
We'll never be able to tax him and look if you really want to destroy wealth inequality to actually roll it back
A wealth tax of three percent isn't really going to cut it again
Wealth grows at like six or seven or eight percent per year on average
That letter that nick and leasel signed it calls specifically for a quote moderate wealth tax
And so we were curious like when does it stop being moderate?
How much are these zillionaires really willing to pay to stop the pitchforks?
So we asked nick hannauer that yacht-owning venture capitalist who riled up so many of his fellow one percenters
When does the wealth tax stop being moderate and when would he stop supporting it?
Oh, that's a super good question
And it's something I haven't thought carefully about
So a moderate
To me a moderate wealth tax
Simply slows the growth of
Of
Large pools of assets
and so
A two percent tax on that or a three percent tax on that slows the growth rate from let's say eight percent to five percent
Which means you're still getting a ton richer than everyone else in the country
If you take the growth rate
to zero
That's no longer moderate
and
Uh, I I guess that begins to test even my
Uh comfort with um
With a wealth tax
So perhaps unsurprisingly hannauer has limits tax enough to slow the growth
Not so much you stop the growth, but he's still out there agitating amongst his fellow zillionaires
In fact after we got off the phone with him
He said he was headed to edinburgh to give a speech about wealth inequality and he's still pushing for a wealth tax
a moderate wealth tax
