From renting hotels to a jobs report-like census in the night, we look at ways communities are helping the homeless.

New York City is legally obligated to find a bed for every person who needs one, every night of the year.

So, when homeless shelters fill up, the city turns to the next best thing: Hotels. The city spends millions renting out entire blocks of hotel rooms.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Research suggests that the most cost-effective way to address homelessness may not be investing in temporary shelters or hotels, but providing rental assistance.

Today on the show, we trace three efforts to address homelessness in America. Including one of the most obvious yet thorniest challenges to getting people off the street: Counting the homeless.

A previous version of this show stated that Phoenix had housed every homeless veteran. But according to Community Solutions, although there is funding to house all veterans, not every homeless veteran has been housed.

SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST:

I met Chris at a park in Manhattan.

Tell me what your nickname is.

CHRIS: C Black (ph) (laughter). So that's the shortness of first and last name.

GONZALEZ: Chris likes good bottled water, the Mets, the Knicks and the Jets, in that order, and chocolate.

CHRIS: Well, that was a Butterfinger I was eating when you approached (laughter).

SALLY HELM, HOST:

Chris has a daughter, who just finished her second year of college.

CHRIS: Carry her picture right on my phone, too.

GONZALEZ: Aw, is that her high school graduation robe?

CHRIS: Uh-huh.

GONZALEZ: Does it say valedictorian?

CHRIS: Yep.

GONZALEZ: Wow.

He's been helping her out a bit, putting some money in her pocket, but she treated him to lunch today.

CHRIS: For the past eight years, I think, I've been paying her phone bill and my phone bill. And now she - because I'm in this situation, she actually paid the phone bill for us. You know, it's - I think I did a good job raising her, you know, so that's a good feeling.

HELM: Chris became homeless a month and a week ago.

CHRIS: Actually, I was on a train for two nights before I got - before I got into the system. Yeah, that's not too good because I didn't know about the hotels.

GONZALEZ: The hotels. Chris checked into a hotel in Manhattan a couple days ago, and all the rooms at this hotel are completely occupied by men who are homeless, paid for by the city.

(SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S "ROAD TO CEVENNES")

HELM: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sally Helm.

GONZALEZ: And I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Today on the show, we look at how New York City ended up renting thousands of hotel rooms for the homeless.

HELM: Also how solving homelessness might be surprisingly cheap and how the first step in solving it is learning how to count.

(SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S "ROAD TO CEVENNES")

HELM: People in New York City have what's called a right to shelter.

GONZALEZ: That means New York City is legally obligated to find a bed for every person who needs one - every single adult, every family, every couple - every night of the year. If the shelters are full, people cannot be turned away. So the city rents blocks of hotel rooms, entire floors, entire hotels, just for the homeless.

HELM: Some are sort of like a shelter-hotel hybrid. Some are five-star hotels with paying customers on some floors and homeless families on others.

GONZALEZ: The hotel Chris is that doesn't allow him to have any visitors, so I couldn't get in.

CHRIS: Actually, I have pictures if you want to see.

GONZALEZ: Sure.

CHRIS: There you go.

GONZALEZ: So this is - your window's overlooking a park.

CHRIS: And that's my bed there and...

GONZALEZ: But this bed doesn't look like a hotel bed.

CHRIS: No, no, no, no.

GONZALEZ: Like, it's not hotel furniture.

CHRIS: Right up here's the headboard of what they had - I guess a queen or a king size. The headboard is still up there, but everything else was taken away so they could put these two - cots are what I call them.

GONZALEZ: Yeah, they're cots. Yeah.

CHRIS: Yeah, it's a twin bed on metal.

GONZALEZ: Oh, so they removed the official hotel furniture.

The hotel that Chris is staying at is a big hotel chain. You've heard of it.

HELM: You've seen signs from the side of the freeway, but we're not going to name the hotel.

GONZALEZ: Because the city told us that in the past, when people have found out that certain commercial hotels are housing the homeless, those hotels dump the homeless guests overnight, leaving the city scrambling to find new hotel beds for them.

HELM: All the hotel rooms the city uses are technically shelters with the rules of a shelter. You have to be in by 10 p.m. and you can't be in the hotel during the day.

CHRIS: Yeah. If you're not working, you have to be out between the hours of 9 to 5. As far as food and drink - water. You can't bring anything else in. There are ways you can sneak some candy bars in. They check your socks, but if you take the candy bar and put it in the back of your sock, they don't check that.

GONZALEZ: And at this hotel, it's two strangers to a room. They each get a locker for their stuff 'cause they're strangers. And Chris says his roommate is a big snorer who keeps the room too cold.

And his bed, your roommate's bed...

CHRIS: Yeah, his is on - by the window.

GONZALEZ: Oh, they're very close to each other. Does it feel like a hotel?

CHRIS: Well, actually, it does. You do get the - some service there. You get the linen (laughter) that changed, but the inside is - looks like a hotel.

GONZALEZ: Last year, the city spent $364 million - about a million dollars a day - using hotels as shelters. And, of course, it spends even more money on traditional shelters.

HELM: Yeah. The city has to do this by court order. Right to shelter has been around since 1979.

GONZALEZ: A group called the Coalition For The Homeless was behind the right to shelter, but even they say that things have turned out kind of weird. Giselle Routhier with the coalition says they never thought it'd come to hotel beds.

GISELLE ROUTHIER: It's far cheaper to provide housing. And not only is it cheaper, it's a more humane thing to do. It just makes logical financial and moral sense.

GONZALEZ: Housing - it costs about $40,000 a year to shelter a single adult like Chris in New York City. And Giselle says that is so much more than what it would cost to help Chris rent an apartment - basically double the cost of renting him an apartment.

ROUTHIER: As the city is now spending a greater and greater share sheltering tens of thousands of people, they need to be thinking about solutions to start housing people so that they can not be spending billions of dollars on shelter costs in perpetuity.

HELM: And cities all over the country spend huge amounts on temporary shelter, even though housing is often cheaper than shelter. Not always - we're going to get into some of the nuances in a minute. Either way, Chris says he wants out.

CHRIS: I got to go. I can't stay, you know, so I do everything I can to get out of this system.

GONZALEZ: Chris misses cooking in a kitchen.

CHRIS: I'm not a Chef Ramsay, but I like to cook my own meals. My meals are 20 minutes or less.

GONZALEZ: What do you miss cooking?

CHRIS: Spaghetti and tomato sauce.

GONZALEZ: And the city, they get it. They say, yeah, these hotels are expensive, so they're phasing out commercial hotel use, but it'll still take five years. And they're investing more in permanent, affordable housing.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL TEPER AND PETER HAJIOFF'S "SPINNING PIANO")

HELM: So how should the country spend money to address homelessness? There was one study in the 1990s that really changed the way people think about this, and that's our next story.

GONZALEZ: First, a little context. Homelessness really comes on the scene as the crisis it is now in the 1970s and '80s. And at the time, the president, Ronald Reagan, thought the market would solve homelessness, that the free market would create low-quality housing for the poorest. So the government shouldn't have to pay for shelters and housing. So Reagan cut funding substantially.

HELM: But by the 1990s, homelessness is getting worse. And advocates are pointing out how expensive homelessness itself can be. There'd be fliers all over the subway about this.

DENNIS CULHANE: You know, the price of a jail cell - $58,000. The price of a hospital bed - $140,000. The price of a shelter - $30,000. The price of an apartment - $11,000, you know.

HELM: That's Dennis Culhane, a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania. He's done research on homelessness, and he knows at this time that most people experiencing homelessness are people like Chris, people who will need a little bit of help for a little bit of time before they get back on their feet.

GONZALEZ: And that there's really just a small group of people who will be homeless for years, maybe forever, people with addiction and mental health issues, the chronically homeless.

CULHANE: People who are chronically homeless spend a lot of time bouncing around between shelters, emergency rooms, getting hospitalized and getting arrested and going to jail.

HELM: And Dennis wanted to find out what costs more - paying rent for the chronically homeless, giving them housing assistance or keeping things how they are, letting them stay homeless. He follows 10,000 people who were chronically homeless over eight years.

GONZALEZ: So you wanted to see how often are homeless people using shelters, going to the ER, going to jail, if they live on the street compared to if they live in a house that is being paid for by the state and the city.

CULHANE: Yup, that's exactly what we did.

GONZALEZ: And when he added up their jail and shelter and hospital stays, he found that those same dollars could have actually solved the problem, could have gone toward paying their rent and getting them off the street. And he found that if you have a house, you're actually less likely to cycle in and out of jails and hospitals and shelters.

HELM: So given all that, it was almost a break even. Technically, it was a thousand dollars more per year to pay rent for this group of people, but Dennis also didn't look at a bunch of other costs associated with homelessness.

CULHANE: We did not include the costs of emergency medical transport, which turns out to be a very big number. And had we included that, we probably would have been better than break even. There would have been a positive return on investment.

HELM: Dennis' study has been replicated dozens of times. And every time, it finds the same thing. It costs about as much to house people who are chronically homeless as it does to not house them.

GONZALEZ: Were you surprised at what you found?

CULHANE: I will say I was surprised that we got so close to break even. I am.

GONZALEZ: Dennis' study looked specifically at a group of people who were considered the least housable and the least deserving of help - single adults, sometimes with addictions. And his finding was counterintuitive, that the thing that seems the most generous - help them get a house - is basically worth it financially. Now, it's important to point out that this doesn't necessarily hold for people who are not chronically homeless, people who are just homeless temporarily.

CULHANE: It doesn't always cost us less. But I think if you look at it over the larger population, it can be break-even in many cases and even better than break-even in some cases as well.

GONZALEZ: And Dennis' study really changed the tide on homelessness policy in a huge way.

HELM: The study comes out in 2002, and it convinces the president, George W. Bush, to make a goal of ending chronic homelessness.

GONZALEZ: Do you - wait. Do you remember when that happened?

CULHANE: Oh, yes, I do, quite clearly. It was very exciting, I have to say.

GONZALEZ: Bush poured $500 million into homeless services after Ronald Reagan had cut almost all of them.

HELM: All this extra funding worked. It brought homelessness down to the point where Dennis says an end was kind of in sight. But in order for cities to get all of this money, they had to do this weird thing, which brings us to our final story.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN ROWCROFT'S "PYRAMID THOUGHTS")

HELM: The U.S. had really no idea how many homeless people there were on the streets. So the Bush administration told cities and counties, find out.

GONZALEZ: Every corner of America that wants to receive federal funding for homeless services has to physically count their homeless population, like, at night, with flashlights and clipboards.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: All right. Here we go. Homeless count, South Bay area.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: 2015.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: 2015.

GONZALEZ: On a cold night in January every other year, this incredible process begins - to count the homeless.

HELM: All over the country, thousands of volunteers fan out to physically count every homeless person they see. It's called the point-in-time count, the PIT. And every city and county does it a little differently.

GONZALEZ: In Los Angeles, it's a visual count. More than 8,000 volunteers cover every inch of the county - all 4,000 square miles - from 7 p.m. to midnight, shining flashlights behind dumpsters, going into every alley, every public parking lot, abandoned buildings.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: How's it going?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: You count that one that ran across the street?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah, I got him.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: You're not in trouble.

GONZALEZ: Every single block is counted - the beaches, the parks, the dried-out riverbeds. Volunteers get a map and a tally sheet, and they just start marking.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Somebody's staying there.

GONZALEZ: If you see an RV, tally mark. Makeshift campsite - tally mark. An actual person - tally mark.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Two individuals.

HELM: All these communities send their totals to Washington, where it gets tabulated. And a quick 11 months later, they get the official number of how many people were experiencing homelessness 11 months ago.

GONZALEZ: And these tally marks are supposed to help determine where funding and resources will do the most good. Cities do not get more funding for having more homeless people. That would create a perverse incentive to have more homeless people. It's more about how fast communities get people out of shelters and into permanent housing - things like that.

HELM: One of the volunteer counters is a guy named Jake Maguire. He first did this in Austin.

JAKE MAGUIRE: I got two hours of training. It was basically, you know, here's how to use the tally sheet. Here's a map of the area you're going to go. Here's your partner. She has a car.

(LAUGHTER)

MAGUIRE: Try to be back by this time, you know?

HELM: Jake is now with a nonprofit called Community Solutions. Their whole thing is trying to end homelessness.

MAGUIRE: We're, like, in our lifetime, like, before we die, like, this has to happen. This has to be a problem that goes away.

GONZALEZ: And these new counts helped them realize that the problem wasn't actually that big.

HELM: In 2010, the point-in-time count showed that there were 106,000 chronically homeless people in the U.S. Remember; that's the worst form of homelessness - people who are out on the streets for years, who might be sick.

GONZALEZ: And Jake and Community Solutions were thinking a hundred thousand people - that's actually a small number relative to other social problems. There are more librarians in the country than there are chronically homeless people.

HELM: So they launch a national campaign to - pretty simple - find homes for those hundred thousand people who are chronically homeless. And they chose this number based on the point-in-time count, the tally marks from that night in January.

GONZALEZ: You're like, OK, this is the number. This is how many people we have who are chronically homeless.

MAGUIRE: Right.

GONZALEZ: And then you find out how the country arrived at that number.

MAGUIRE: Right.

GONZALEZ: And what do you think?

MAGUIRE: I think, OK. I guess that's how we do it, right?

(LAUGHTER)

MAGUIRE: Yeah. I never questioned it. Yeah. It took a couple years for me to start to wonder, is this number particularly useful?

GONZALEZ: Because here's what happened to the 100,000 Homes Campaign. All these communities came together and found 100,000 homes - actually, 105,000 homes.

MAGUIRE: And we sort of sat back and thought, this is great. We just took care of, you know, 90 percent of the problem. We're going to see a massive decline in chronic homelessness.

HELM: But that didn't happen. The next point-in-time count showed that chronic homelessness only went down by 20,000 people, not 105,000. So Jake thinks, OK, this point-in-time count is clearly missing the real picture. Like, maybe we can't just count the homeless with flashlights once every other year.

MAGUIRE: We needed current information. We needed information that was going to be up to date, in real time in every community in the country.

GONZALEZ: This is how we track other important things, like unemployment and jobs.

MAGUIRE: We want to know every month, like, how is the economy doing? Are we creating new jobs? Is the unemployment rate going up or down? Because our expectation is that if we start to see that number going in the wrong direction, there are people in the federal government and other places who could do something in response to that information if they have it in time.

GONZALEZ: It's so important for those numbers to be meaningful that economists go back and revise them months later if they're a little off.

HELM: Jake thinks the U.S. could be tracking homelessness as often as unemployment and jobs, or like the way we track crime and natural disasters in real time so we know where to deploy resources to minimize the damage.

GONZALEZ: So they set out to create a database of every single person experiencing homelessness, not a tally - a name and a survey, one that's updated at least twice a week - real-time homelessness data. And big cities with huge homeless populations, like New York and LA, are, like, impossible.

MAGUIRE: Like, oh, you couldn't possibly get that kind of data quality in a place this big, which I just think is crazy. Like, we track the flu in real time. We tracked polio around the world in real time. I mean, of course you can get that. You know, most of the people in LA who are experiencing homelessness are known to somebody already. Like, what would it just take to get all that data in one place?

HELM: And they wouldn't just count people. They would talk to them, ask them exactly what their situation was.

GONZALEZ: I mean, like, how do you do that? You knock on a tent in the middle of the night?

MAGUIRE: Yeah, sometimes you wake them up. You don't, you know, touch them. You sort of try to call out to them and say, ma'am, hi, I'm sorry to bother you.

HELM: They might ask if they're sick, if they're veterans.

GONZALEZ: And do you ask, like, are you addicted to drugs?

MAGUIRE: Very personal questions. Very personal questions, yeah.

GONZALEZ: So you do ask that?

MAGUIRE: It's extremely sensitive, yeah.

GONZALEZ: And they want to know this because a lot of communities have money that's specifically earmarked to help people struggling with substance abuse or health problems or if they're veterans. So if they know this, they can connect people better.

MAGUIRE: Say, OK, what do we know about this person? What do they need? What would it take to get them housed? What's the plan? Next week, is that person housed? If not, what do they still need? OK, what's the plan?

HELM: They've done this in 69 communities - Bergen County, N.J., Rockville, Ill., Chicago, Jacksonville, Phoenix.

GONZALEZ: And when Phoenix did this, they found out that Phoenix had about 400 homeless veterans and that they actually had all the federal and local housing subsidies they needed to house all those homeless veterans. It was just about connecting the person to the place.

HELM: And this group has actually had more luck ending veteran homelessness than anything else. They've worked with nine communities who have solved veteran homelessness. And to be fair, they got a lot of help from the federal government. The U.S. spends a lot of money on veteran homelessness specifically.

GONZALEZ: And four communities in the country have ended chronic homelessness overall, at least one without the help of this group and three with their help. They say these communities are at functional zero, meaning if you're homeless there, the community can find you a home within a month.

GONZALEZ: That's my mom's favorite...

CHRIS: Oh, yeah?

GONZALEZ: ...Chocolate. That reminds me of my mom.

CHRIS: You got the peanuts, the coconut, the chocolate.

GONZALEZ: Almonds.

CHRIS: Yeah.

GONZALEZ: It's almonds.

CHRIS: Almonds, right.

[POST-PUBLICATION CORRECTION: A previous version of this show stated that Phoenix had housed every homeless veteran. But according to Community Solutions, although there is funding to house all veterans, not every homeless veteran has been housed.]

People in New York City have
what's called a right to shelter.
That means New York City is
legally obligated to find a bed for
every person who needs one. Every
single adult, every family, every
couple, every night of the year.
If the shelters are full, people
cannot be turned away. So
the city rents blocks
of hotel rooms, entire floors,
entire hotels, just for
the homeless. Some are sort of like a
shelter-hotel hybrid.
Some are five-star hotels
with paying customers on some floors
and homeless families on others.
The hotel Chris is at doesn't allow him
to have any visitors, so I couldn't get in.
So this is your windows overlooking a park?
But this bed doesn't
look like a hotel
bed.
Like it's not hotel furniture.
Of what they had, I guess a
queen or king size.
The headboard is still up there,
but everything else was taken away
so they could put these two cots, or what I
call them. Yeah, they're cots.
Twin bed on metal.
So they removed the
official hotel furniture.
The hotel that Chris is staying at
is a big hotel chain.
You've heard of it. You've seen
signs from the side of the freeway.
But we're not going to name the hotel
because the city told us that in the past
when people have found out that certain
commercial hotels are housing the homeless,
those hotels
dump the homeless guests overnight,
leaving the city scrambling to find
new hotel beds for them.
All the hotel rooms the city uses
are technically shelters
with the rules of a shelter.
You have to be in by 10 p.m.
and you can't be in the hotel
during the day. Yeah, if you're not
working, you have to be out
between the hours of 9 to 5.
As far as food and drink, water.
You can't bring anything else in.
There are ways you can sneak some candy bars in.
They check your socks.
But if you take the candy bar and put it in the back
of your sock, they don't
check that. And at this hotel,
it's two strangers to a room.
They each get a locker for their stuff
because they're strangers.
And Chris says his roommate is a big
snorer who keeps the room
too cold. And his bed, your roommate's
bed, his is by the window.
Oh, very close to each other.
Does it feel like a hotel?
Well, actually it does.
You do get some
service there. You get
the linen.
But the inside
looks like a hotel.
Last year, the city spent
$364 million.
About a million dollars
a day using hotels as
shelters. And of course, it spends even
more money on traditional shelters.
Yeah, the city has to do this by court
order. Right to shelter has been around
since 1979. A group
called the Coalition for the Homeless was
behind the right to shelter.
But even they say that things have turned out
kind of weird. Giselle Routhier,
with the coalition, says they never
thought it'd come to hotel
beds. It's far cheaper to provide housing
and not only is it cheaper, it's
a more humane thing to do.
It just makes
a logical, financial, and moral sense.
Housing. It costs about $40,000
a year to shelter
a single adult like Chris in New York
City. And Giselle says that
is so much more than what it would cost
to help Chris rent an apartment.
Basically, double
the cost of renting him an apartment.
As the city is now spending
a greater and greater share
sheltering tens of thousands of
people, they need to be thinking
about solutions to start
housing people so that they can
not be spending billions of dollars
on shelter costs
in perpetuity. And
cities all over the country spend
huge amounts on temporary shelter.
Even though housing is often
cheaper than shelter, not
always. We're going to get into some of the nuances in a minute.
Either way, Chris says
he wants out. I gotta
go. I can't stay, you know.
So I do everything I can to get out of
the system. Chris misses
cooking in a kitchen. Now I'm not a
Chef Ramsay, but I
like to cook my own meal. My meals are
20 minutes or less. What do you
miss cooking? Spaghetti and
tomato sauce. And the city,
they get it. They say, yeah, these hotels are
expensive. So they're
phasing out commercial hotel use.
But it'll still take five years.
And they're investing more in permanent
affordable housing.
So how should
the country spend money to address
homelessness? There was one
study in the 1990s that
really changed the way people think about this.
And that's our next story. First, a little
context. Homelessness really comes
on the scene as the crisis it is
now in the 1970s and 80s.
And at the time, the president,
Ronald Reagan, thought the market
would solve homelessness. That the free
market would create low quality
housing for the poorest. So the
government shouldn't have to pay for shelters
and housing. So Reagan
cut funding substantially.
But by the 1990s,
homelessness is getting worse.
And advocates are pointing out how
expensive homelessness itself
can be. There'd be flyers
all over the subway about this.
The price of a jail cell, $58,000.
The price of a hospital
bed, $140,000.
The price of a shelter, $30,000.
The price of an apartment, $11,000.
That's Dennis Kuhlhain,
a professor of social policy at the University
of Pennsylvania. He's done research
on homelessness, and he knows
at this time that most people
experiencing homelessness are
people like Chris. People
who will need a little bit of help for a
little bit of time before they get back on their feet.
And that there's really just a small
group of people who will be homeless
for years, maybe forever.
People with addiction and mental health issues.
The chronically homeless.
People who are chronically homeless
spend a lot of time bouncing
around between shelters,
emergency rooms, getting hospitalized,
and getting arrested and going
to jail. And Dennis wanted to find out
what costs more.
Paying rent for the
chronically homeless, giving them housing assistance,
or keeping things
how they are, letting them stay homeless.
He follows 10,000 people
who were chronically homeless over 8 years.
So you wanted to see
how often are homeless
people using
shelters, going to the ER,
going to jail,
if they live on the street compared
to if they live in a house that is
being paid for by the state and the city.
That's exactly what we did. And when he
added up their jail and shelter
and hospital stays, he found
that those same dollars
could have actually solved
the problem. Could have gone toward paying
their rent and getting them off
the street. And he found that if
you have a house,
you're actually less likely
to cycle in and out of jails
and hospitals and shelters.
So given all that, it was almost a break
even. Technically it was $1,000
more per year to pay rent for this group
of people. But Dennis also didn't
look at a bunch of other costs associated
with homelessness. We did not include
the costs of
emergency medical transport,
which turns out to be a very big
number. And had we included
that, we probably would have been better than
break even. There would have been a positive return on investment.
Dennis' study has been replicated
dozens of times. And
every time it finds the same thing.
It costs about as much to house
people who are chronically homeless as
it does to not house them.
Were you surprised at what you found?
I will say I was surprised that we got so
close to break even. I am.
Dennis' study looked specifically at a group
of people who were considered the least
houseable and the least
deserving of help. Single adults,
sometimes with addictions. And his
finding was counterintuitive.
That the thing that seems the most
generous, help them get a house,
is basically worth it.
Financially. Now it's important
to point out that this doesn't necessarily
hold for people who are not
chronically homeless. People who are just homeless
temporarily. It doesn't always
cost us less. But I think
if you look at it over the larger
population, it can
be break even in many cases
and even better than break even in some
cases as well. And Dennis' study
really changed the tide on
homelessness policy. In a huge
way. The study comes out
in 2002. And it convinces the
President, George W. Bush, to make
a goal of ending chronic
homelessness. Do you remember
when that happened? Oh yes I do.
Quite clearly. It was very
exciting I have to say. Bush
poured 500 million dollars into
homeless services after Ronald Reagan
had cut almost all of them.
All this extra funding worked.
It brought homelessness down.
To the point where Dennis says
an end was kind of in sight.
But in order for cities to
get all of this money,
they had to do this weird thing.
Which brings us to our final story.
The US
had really no idea how
many homeless people there were on the
streets. So the Bush
administration told cities and counties,
find out. Every corner
of America that wants to receive
federal funding for homeless services
has to physically count
their homeless population.
Like at night
with flashlights and clipboards.
On a cold night in January,
every other year, this incredible
process begins to
count the homeless.
All over the country, thousands of
volunteers fan out to physically
count every homeless person
they see. It's called the point
in time count, the pit.
And every city and county
does it a little differently. In Los Angeles
it's a visual count. More than
8,000 volunteers cover every
inch of the county. All 4,000
square miles from 7 p.m.
to midnight. Shining flashlights
behind dumpsters going into every
alley, every public parking lot,
abandoned buildings.
Did you count that when they ran across the street?
Yeah, I got it.
Every single
block is counted. The beaches,
the parks, the dried out riverbeds.
Volunteers get a map and a
tally sheet and they
just start marking.
If you see an RV,
tally mark. Make shift campsite,
tally mark.
In actual person, tally mark.
All these communities
send their totals to Washington where
it gets tabulated. And
a quick 11 months later
they get the official number of how many
people were experiencing homelessness
11 months ago. And
these tally marks are supposed to help determine
where funding and resources will
do the most good. Cities do
not get more funding for having more
homeless people. That would create a perverse
incentive to have more homeless people.
It's more about how fast communities
get people out of shelters and into
permanent housing, things like that.
One of the volunteer counters is a guy
named Jake McGuire.
He first did this in Austin.
I got two hours of training. It was basically
here's how to use the tally
sheet. Here's the map of the area you're
going to go. Here's your partner.
She has a car.
Try to be back by this time.
Jake is now with a non-profit called
Community Solutions. Their whole thing
is trying to end homelessness.
We're like in our lifetime, before
we die, like this has to happen.
This has to be a problem that goes away.
And these new counts
help them realize that the problem
wasn't actually that big.
In 2010, the point in time
count showed that there were
106,000 chronically homeless people
in the U.S. Remember that's the worst
form of homelessness, people who are out on the streets
for years, who might be sick.
And Jake and Community Solutions were
thinking 100,000
people? That's actually a small
number relative to other social problems.
There are more librarians
in the country than there are
chronically homeless people. So
they launch a national campaign
to, pretty simple,
find homes for those 100,000 people
who are chronically homeless.
And they chose this number based on
the point in time count. The tally marks
from that night in January. You're like
okay, this is the number, this is how many people
we have who are chronically homeless.
And then you find out how
the country arrived at that number.
And what do you think? I think
okay, I guess that's how we do it. Great.
Yeah, I never, I never questioned
it. Yeah. It took a couple
years for me to start to wonder
is this number
particularly useful?
Because here's what happened to
the 100,000 homes campaign.
All these communities came
together and found
100,000 homes. Actually
105,000 homes.
And we sort of sat back and thought
this is great. We just took care
of 90% of the problem.
We're going to see a massive decline
in chronic homelessness.
But that didn't happen.
The next point in time count showed
that chronic homelessness only went
down by 20,000 people.
Not 105,000.
So Jake thinks, okay,
this point in time count
is clearly missing the real picture.
Like maybe we can't just count
the homeless with flashlights
once every other year. We needed
current information.
We needed information that was going
to be up to date in real
time in every community in
the country. This is how we track
other important things like unemployment
and jobs. We want to know every
month like how is the economy doing?
Are we creating new jobs? Is the unemployment
rate going up or down? Because our expectation
is that if we start to see that number
going in the wrong direction, there are people
in the federal government and other places who
could do something in response to that information
if they have it in time.
It's so important for those numbers
to be meaningful that economists go
back and revise them months
later if they're a little off.
Jake thinks the US could be tracking
homelessness as often as
unemployment and jobs. Or like
the way we track crime and natural disasters
in real time so we know
where to deploy resources to minimize the
damage. So they set out to
create a database of
every single person experiencing
homelessness. Not a tally,
a name, and a survey.
One that's updated at least twice a week.
Real time homelessness
data. And big cities
with huge homeless populations
like New York and LA are like
impossible. Like oh
you couldn't possibly get that kind of data quality
in a place this big.
Which I just think is crazy. Like we track
the flu in real time. We track polio
around the world in real time. I mean
of course you can get that.
Most of the people in LA who are experiencing
homelessness are known to somebody already.
Like what would it just take to get all that data
in one place? And they wouldn't just count
people. They would talk to them.
Ask them exactly what their situation was.
I mean like how do you do
that? You knock on a tent in the
middle of the night?
Yeah, sometimes.
You wake them up.
You don't, you know, touch them.
You sort of try to call out to them.
Say ma'am, ma'am.
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you.
They might ask if they're sick, if they're
veterans. And do you ask like
are you addicted to drugs?
Very personal
questions. Very personal questions.
So you do ask that?
It's extremely sensitive.
And they want to know this because
a lot of communities have money
that's specifically earmarked to help
people struggling with substance abuse
or health problems or if
they're veterans. So if they know
this, they can connect people
better. Say OK,
what do we know about this person? What do they need?
What would it take to get them housed?
What's the plan? Next week
is that person housed? If not, what do they
still need? OK, what's the plan?
They've done this in 69 communities.
Bergen County, New Jersey,
Rockville, Illinois,
Chicago, Jacksonville,
Phoenix. And when Phoenix did this,
they found out that Phoenix had about
400 homeless veterans
and that they actually had
all the federal and local housing
subsidies they needed to house
all those homeless veterans. It was
just about connecting the person
to the place. And
this group has actually had more luck ending
veteran homelessness than anything
else. They've worked with nine
communities who have solved veteran
homelessness. And
to be fair, they got a lot of help from the federal
government. The U.S. spends a lot
of money on veteran homelessness
specifically. And four communities
in the country have ended chronic
homelessness overall. At least
one without the help of this group
and three with their help.
They say these communities are at
functional zero, meaning
if you're homeless there,
the community can find you a home
within a month.

What's your go-to candy bar?
Usually
Almond Joy.
Almond Joy is not a common
favorite chocolate bar.
I've had that since I was
young so I love that.
That's my mom's favorite. That
reminds me of my mom. The peanuts, the
coconut, the chocolate.
Almond. Yes.
Almond. Right.
