What does the rise of dominant tech companies say about competition and the state of antitrust law? Third in a series.

This is the third episode in our series on antitrust law in America. Our first episode told the story of Ida Tarbell and how her reporting on John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil changed antitrust law in the early 1900s. Our second episode followed the turn that took place in the 1970s in response to Robert Bork's Antitrust Paradox.
Planet Money
Antitrust 3: Big Tech

For this episode, we're looking at the present, and toward a future where markets may be dominated by tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. A new wave of antitrust thinkers is asking if the size and reach of these companies is a threat to competition, and ultimately to consumers. It's the backlash to the backlash introduced by Robert Bork in the seventies, and a reassessment of the relationship between the government and business in the United States.

**faster whisper:**
Today's show is part three of what I have been calling the Planet Money Antitrust Trilogy.
The show will be much better if you go back and listen to the first two episodes.
If you do not, here is the text that scrolls on the screen at the beginning of the movie.
The United States government used to use antitrust law a lot to protect small companies
against big companies in the name of competition.
Then there was a backlash led by a judge named Robert Bork.
He wrote a book called The Antitrust Paradox that argued antitrust enforcement had gotten
out of hand and the government needed to back off.
Now in the past couple years, as a few tech companies have gotten very big and very powerful,
a backlash to the backlash has begun.
My name is Lena Kahn and I'm an academic fellow at Columbia Law School and a senior
fellow at the Open Markets Institute.
And you're a lawyer?
I'm a lawyer.
When Lena Kahn was in law school two years ago, she wrote a paper for the Law Review.
What was the title of the paper?
Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.
An allusion to that Bork book, The Antitrust Paradox.
Why did you choose that title?
I was interested in exploring how Bork's approach to antitrust had enabled Amazon's
rise.
And the paradox with Amazon seemed to me that here we had a company that was amassing
dominance in various markets, but our current approach to antitrust law was really keeping
us blind to that dominance.
And so that to me seemed like an interesting tension.
Our current approach to antitrust law, Bork's approach, is known as consumer welfare.
And the basic idea is low prices and lots of choices are good.
If consumers are getting these things, then there's no antitrust problem.
And clearly, Amazon has delivered low prices and lots of choices.
So it hasn't run into much trouble with antitrust law in the United States.
And yet Lena Kahn argued in this paper, there are things that Amazon has done that
have been bad for competition.
So her wonky article comes out.
She hears from a few antitrust lawyers.
Then her article gets mentioned in the New York Times.
That spurred kind of a new wave of interest.
And so I just started receiving more and more emails.
I feel like you're being somewhat modest about this, which I respect a tremendous
amount, even though it's not good for our story.
What she is not saying is that this student law review article completely blew up.
I mean, look, I know you didn't go on Ellen or whatever.
Or did you go on Ellen?
Or did you go on Ellen?
Did I miss it?
It got big.
We know it got big.
Lena Kahn learned that the rise of a few giant tech companies had made this
very wonky thing, antitrust policy, suddenly feel urgent and important to lots
of ordinary people.
Is it bad?
These companies are so big.
They assign that the free market is failing us and competition is disappearing.
Do we need to think about antitrust in a new way?
Congressman wanted to meet with her.
The Washington Post and the Atlantic wanted to profile her.
CNBC, NPR.
She joins me now to talk about how antitrust law handles Amazon.
Lena, thank you for being with us.
Good to be here.
Let me first say Amazon is among NPR's corporate sponsors.
Right.
We're going to have to talk about that.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Jacob Goldstein.
I'm Kenny Malone.
Today on the show, Amazon.
One of our corporate sponsors.
And Facebook.
Also a corporate sponsor.
And Google.
I think a corporate sponsor.
Not a corporate sponsor.
Oh, OK.
But all of this is kind of the point.
These three companies are suddenly everywhere.
They have an incredible amount of money and power.
And Lena Kahn is part of this new wave of thinkers who are starting to say maybe
the rise of these giant tech companies is a sign that antitrust is broken and we
need to fix it.
The word for this podcast comes from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation,
helping NPR advance journalistic excellence in the digital age.
The world is complicated.
And for many of us, history class was a long time ago.
That's where we come in.
I'm Randa De Fattah.
I'm Ram-Tin Arablui.
And we're the hosts of Thru Line, NPR's new history podcast.
Every week we'll dig into forgotten stories from the moments that shaped our world.
Thru Line.
History like you've never heard it before.
So the question for today's show is what, if anything, should we do about the big tech
firms?
I mean, actually, that's a ridiculously large question.
There's no way we could do that in a show.
I mean, we're going to do a subset of that question, right?
We're going to focus specifically on competition and the free market and the role of the
government.
We're going to focus on antitrust.
So the question really is, should we be using antitrust law in some way with
respect to these big tech companies?
And the way we're going to do this, we're going to talk to two very smart people, lawyers
whose job is to answer questions like these.
And we're going to ask them two big questions.
One, are we thinking about antitrust the right way?
Does this consumer welfare standard still work?
And question two, if you had all the antitrust power in the world, what would you do?
First up, Lena Kahn.
Do you want a title?
We're going to make you the ruler of antitrust in America.
That seems kind of antithetical to the spirit of antitrust.
Well played.
Oh, so are you sort of respectfully declining your appointment?
I'm happy to play along with the hypothetical.
Is there a reason in particular to focus on big technology firms?
So the reason I've been focusing on big technology companies is because I think some
of the blind spots of the current antitrust approach are most significant in the
context of these tech companies, in part because in many instances, they're
offering products or services that are nominally free, right?
We're paying in data.
And so that complicates how antitrust looks at these issues.
Think of Google and Facebook.
You don't have to pay money to use those services.
So the current antitrust approach, consumer welfare standard, which focuses
largely on price, just isn't going to work very well.
Also, she says, there's just this fundamental nature of a few key tech
sectors. They just tend to be winner take all.
Everybody's going to tend to end up using one search engine, one social
network. Everybody who wants to buy or sell online is going to wind up at the
one online store with the most buyers and sellers.
Can we talk about specific companies?
OK.
What should we do about Amazon?
Well, I think first we need to have investigations into Amazon's conduct.
We have a very meager understanding of how the different parts of its
businesses actually interlink and how it potentially uses data collected in one
market to advantage itself in another market and that sort of thing.
And so I think as a first step, more investigations, more hearings,
just to understand what's happening.
And that should then help inform what we should do.
OK.
What about as a second step?
I mean, you've written about things that are way more interesting,
frankly, than investigations.
Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, one problem that I've been focused on is the
potential conflict of interest that seems baked into some of these companies'
current businesses.
Amazon. Let's talk about Amazon in particular.
OK, let's talk about Amazon.
Amazon is many things.
But the main thing most people think of when they think of Amazon is this
marketplace, a store where anybody who wants to can sell almost anything
they want to millions and millions of potential customers.
In the jargon, this marketplace is a platform.
And what we wound up mostly talking to Lena Kahn about is what does it mean
for competition when one company winds up controlling such a huge platform?
I mean, what's so unique about platforms is that platforms end up
dramatically reducing the cost of entry for all the third parties.
And what that means is platforms can be really good for competition
because now there's this place where everybody in America who wants to buy,
say, batteries is going to go to buy their batteries.
So if I want to get into the battery selling business, that is great for me.
Of course, I have to compete against all the other battery brands out there,
not only Duracell and Energizer, but also Amazon's own private label
batteries, Amazon Basics batteries.
Amazon has built out a pretty extensive private label.
It has at least 120 different labels where it's now actually producing
Amazon-based goods.
Now, you could argue, and a lot of people do, that these Amazon
store brands are good for competition.
Amazon is one more competitor in the market.
But Kahn argues in the long run, Amazon selling Amazon brand stuff
on Amazon may be bad for competition.
So that, I think, can create a conflict of interest.
And so far as Amazon owns the platform, it runs the platform,
it decides who comes up where in the search rankings.
But it's also competing with all the merchants that are now
dependent on the platform.
So this problem, I mean, this seems like a fundamental,
like a store brand problem, right?
Like they're, you know, whatever.
Walmart is a bigger retailer than Amazon, and they have store brands.
And they can, you know, put the Purina dog food on the bottom shelf
and the old boy or whatever their house dog food is on the top shelf.
And you could imagine the same problem there, right?
A giant retailer with all this power just says,
oh, look, what's selling on our store?
We're going to have a store brand.
Is that a similar competitive problem?
I think you have to really look at the degree to which the retailer
or the distributor is playing a bottleneck role in a sector.
So with retailers, it's absolutely true that they have private labels.
Generally speaking, there's much more competition
in the retail industry than there is in online commerce.
And so I think that means that the stakes of discrimination
are quite different.
So you're saying I could shop at Walmart or I could shop at Kroger,
I could shop at Costco.
It's that level of competition that you're talking about.
There's that level of competition.
There's also the issue of how risk gets assigned.
The issue of who is taking the risk here,
the company developing a new product or the company running the store
where the product is going to be sold.
So let's say, Jacob, that you and I decide to go into business.
We're going to sell hats for dogs.
Yes, million dollar idea.
The way a lot of traditional stores work is they buy the dog hats from us
in bulk.
Yes.
And then if the dog hats sit on the shelves and don't sell,
that's not really our problem, at least not in the short run.
The retail store paid us money for our hats.
We have the money.
The store took the risk that the hats might not sell.
Amazon does not work that way.
Amazon is not going to buy the dog hats from us.
We can post our dog hats for sale on Amazon.
And if they don't sell, we go out of business.
And it did not cost Amazon anything.
If the dog hats do sell, then we pay Amazon a chunk of our revenue.
And if our dog hats sell like crazy, if the world suddenly
goes bananas for dog hats, then Amazon is
free to start selling their own line of dog hats, Amazon Basics dog hats.
There are merchants that bring all sorts of niche products
that are not guaranteed to sell.
It's these third parties that are undertaking the original risk
to invest in a product and see, hey, is this going to succeed?
What's troubling is that in some instances,
when a product does start doing well, Amazon observes it
and then takes that idea, produces it itself,
knocks out the third party from the top search listings.
And so suddenly, it's Amazon that's
reaping the reward of the risk that somebody else took.
Then what would you expect the sort of long-term consequence would be?
I think the long-term consequence will be third parties will
be more reluctant to invest in products,
to take risks, to bring them to market.
The idea being that even if this product succeeds,
there's a good chance that Amazon will appropriate
the value of that reward, and they'll just be left hanging.
In other words, if Amazon's just going to wait and see
if our dog hats sell, and if they do sell,
it's going to start selling Amazon Basics dog hats,
why should we get into the dog hat business in the first place?
Khan argues that lots of people will think,
why should I even start selling anything online
if I'm just going to end up losing to Amazon?
And in the long run, she says, this will mean less competition.
You've presented this as a problem or as a potential problem.
What's the solution?
I think one solution is separating the marketplace
from Amazon to private label.
I think if you're going to be a dominant marketplace,
then you perhaps shouldn't be able to also sell
on that marketplace, putting yourself
in direct competition with all the merchants that are dependent.
I mean, I think that relationship of dependence
is really one to drive home here.
So you're saying that you would say to Amazon,
you can either sell Amazon stuff,
or you can be a marketplace for all these third-party sellers,
but you are not allowed to do both.
That's right.
Huh.
That's a big one.
It's a big one not just because it would mean
the government intervening in a big way
in this giant business, although obviously that is big.
It's a big one because, really, we haven't seen
antitrust enforcement on this scale in this country for decades.
And by the way, we did reach out to Amazon,
and a spokesperson argued Amazon making its own product
means lower prices, better products, and more competition.
He also noted that private label is a relatively tiny part
of Amazon's business.
After the break, we talked to our second emperor,
and he tells us what he would do about Facebook.
It's Oscar season, and we don't want you to show up
on the red carpet unprepared.
That's why Pop Culture Happy Hour is here to help you
sort through the nominees and separate the best from the rest.
Listen now, and we might even help you
dominate your Oscars pool.
The second person we're going to talk to today
is Scott Joplin, and he's going to talk to us
about his experience with the Oscars.
Scott, you're going to talk to us about your experience
with the Oscars, and you're going to talk to us
about your experience with the Oscars.
The first person we're going to talk to today is Scott Hemphill.
He's an NYU law professor.
He is teaching right now an antitrust course
called Big Tech and Standard Oil, perfect for the series
that we're working on, and he did want us to mention
that he's done some consulting work for a firm
that has concerns about Amazon's conduct.
Hemphill has worked in antitrust for a long time,
and for most of that time, most people
were just not very interested in talking about antitrust.
Was there a moment that you realized other people
played a role in the last presidential campaign?
On both sides.
It was a plank in the Democratic platform,
and then candidate Trump from time to time
raised concerns about possible targets
for antitrust intervention.
Was it like exciting?
Sure, it was exciting.
It was exciting.
So like, what's it like working and, you know,
being an antitrust expert now,
having this be your field at this...
It's cool that people are excited about these issues.
Is there a but there?
Well, you worry that we'll get it wrong,
that we'll get too excited, that we'll pass a new law,
that does more harm than good,
that people will have unrealistic expectations
for what antitrust is about and what it can accomplish.
Scott Hemphill describes his antitrust views
as middle of the road.
He doesn't think the system needs to change
as much as Lena Kahn thinks the system needs to change.
Here's one difference between the two of them.
Kahn thinks the consumer welfare standard
just fundamentally can't work anymore.
Hemphill thinks it can't.
Remember, consumer welfare is a lot about prices,
but companies like Google and Facebook
give their product away to people for free.
So it seems like under the consumer welfare standard,
it would be really hard to know
what to do about these companies.
But...
So we say consumer welfare and antitrust is a shorthand
for situations where sometimes we don't mean
consumers in the sense of individuals.
Consumers can also include companies that buy stuff.
Like say, companies that buy ads on Google and Facebook.
And if Google and Facebook use their market power
to jack up ad prices,
that can be a violation of antitrust law
under the consumer welfare standard.
Scott Hemphill says generally we are thinking
about antitrust in the right way.
We don't need to rethink the goal of antitrust,
but he is still worried
about big tech companies and competition.
We're gonna make you emperor of antitrust now, today.
What would you do?
Two major things.
Oh, one is...
I just want to point out,
as soon as you were anointed emperor,
you folded your arms in a very sort of noble fashion.
It was good.
I thought a power pose would be helpful
in answering this question.
It's good.
One place to go is to investigate.
Now this may seem like small stuff,
of course we want to investigate.
Pretty weak.
So I'm warming up here.
The main thing I'd want to do is to take a hard look
at tech mergers that have already been consummated
where there may have been
an anti-competitive problem at the time.
So the big idea for Scott Hemphill is mergers.
That is the thing that worries him
when he thinks about big tech and antitrust.
And specifically, what are some of those mergers?
So the one that jumps out to me is Facebook, Instagram.
In 2012, Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion.
And Hemphill says, as antitrust emperor,
he would try to figure out why Facebook did that.
And the why, he says, is important
because mergers are not inherently an antitrust problem.
He says sometimes there is a totally legit reason
for two firms to merge.
A classic reason for mergers is if you think
one firm can help successfully grow, promote,
develop the technology of the other.
So Facebook already has all this data
and it has a great ad sales team or whatever,
things that will really benefit Instagram.
So Instagram is just gonna be a more efficient business,
it's gonna grow better,
that's gonna be good for everybody.
That's the good news, happy story, sure.
And it might be right.
Also, it might be wrong.
The Facebook, Instagram merger
might be a bad news, sad story.
Here's how that story goes.
Company's already big,
and then it starts getting bigger and bigger
by buying up other companies.
That is a sign that maybe the company
is trying to suppress competition,
to just buy up its rivals
so it doesn't have to compete.
That is obviously bad for competition.
Hemphill says, as antitrust emperor,
he would try to figure out what Facebook was thinking here.
Why did it wanna buy Instagram?
Good news, happy story, or bad news, sad story?
By the way, I just wanna bring Lena Kahn back
for like one second here
because she also mentioned the Facebook, Instagram merger
as a potential antitrust problem.
And she had this really interesting reason
why it was bad for competition.
Well, let's just think about a real example,
which is as revelations about Facebook's lax privacy
and security protocols have been coming clear.
You've heard more people say,
I'm quitting Facebook, I'm just closing this down.
At least I have my Instagram account, right?
I think privacy is one good example of a dimension
on which consumers should be able to choose
and having more competition could provide that.
So this Facebook, Instagram merger is one place
where Lena Kahn and Scott Hemphill
are pretty close on what they think we should do.
What I'm saying is that a transaction
motivated at the time by avoidance of competition
is a good candidate for divestiture after the fact.
Wait, is that middle of the road consumer welfare
is fine antitrust emperor Scott Hemphill saying
after an investigation, depending on the findings,
the government should maybe break up
one of the biggest companies in the world?
That's what I'm thinking about, yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, great.
You're about to not be the emperor anymore.
Do you have any last wishes?
No, no, it's a heavy responsibility to the emperor.
Heavy as the head.
We did talk to people at Facebook
about this whole Instagram thing.
And they made the case that both Facebook
and Instagram benefited from the merger.
They pointed out that Instagram
had infrastructure problems in just about 30 million users
when they acquired the company.
Six years later, there are 1 billion users.
They also noted that, quote,
relevant regulators saw no reason to stop the merger.
So we talked about Amazon with Lena Kahn
and Facebook with Scott Hemphill.
Now, let's talk about Google for just a minute.
Google is a big one.
We did a whole episode a couple years ago
about Google and antitrust.
Still online to find it, just Google.
Google is big, is that bad?
That was the headline.
Since then, there's been more antitrust news
specifically a case in the European Union
that focused on Android,
on Google's operating system for smartphones,
which is by far the most popular
mobile operating system in the world.
Google had told phone makers,
if you want to use Android,
you also have to pre-install the Google search app
and Google's Chrome browser on your phones.
The EU looked into this
and last year issued a decision.
Quote, Google has used Android as a vehicle
to cement the dominance of its search engine, dot, dot, dot.
They have denied European consumers
the benefits of effective competition
in the important mobile sphere.
The European Union found this illegal
under its antitrust rules
and fined Google $5 billion.
Google said in a statement afterwards, quote,
Android has created more choice for everyone, not less.
The company is appealing the ruling.
So, okay, we have done these three shows on antitrust
and the first two were these historical moments
when we went through really big changes as a country
in the way we think about, you know,
the free market and big business and competition
and the role of the government.
And now, you know, this episode,
we have the present moment,
the rise of the tech giants.
And, you know, the ending question has to be,
is this another moment when we need to once again,
sort of stop and rethink the way antitrust works?
Scott Hemphill, pretty middle-of-the-road antitrust lawyer
says, no, maybe we could enforce the current rules better,
but the rules themselves,
the worldview is basically working.
And then there's Lena Kahn.
She is part of this other group of thinkers
who are saying antitrust is broken.
You know, what the tech giants have shown us
is there are these fundamental problems with competition
that the current antitrust worldview
just is not detecting.
And she's saying the government really needs to go back
to that pre Robert Bork era.
It needs to intervene more often in the free market
in order to make free market competition work.
We know we didn't talk about monopsony.
