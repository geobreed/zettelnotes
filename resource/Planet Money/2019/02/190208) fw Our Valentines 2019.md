We give a shout out to the stuff we've been obsessing over in the office — those stories that were so good, we wished we had thought of them ourselves.

We're back for our annual tradition: Channeling another year's worth of jealousy and self-loathing into a whole episode just for you. Happy Valentine's Day!

#893: Our Valentines 2019

Here at Planet Money, we spend a lot of time digging around for stories and new ideas. So when we come across something that we think brilliantly explains our economy--we're often like, "Why the heck didn't we come up with that?!"

On today's show, we've got valentines for the Bank of Jamaica's new music video, the Netflix documentary about the Fyre Festival, mixed martial arts, the book In My Father's House, and Kashmir Hill's series on living without technology.

Music: "Baiser Fatal," "Surf Blaze," "Big Winner" and "Soul Sitar."

NICK FOUNTAIN, HOST:

Recently, Gizmodo reporter Kashmir Hill tried something nearly impossible for journalism.

KASHMIR HILL: I wanted to see if it was possible to live without the tech giants.

FOUNTAIN: So Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple and Google. She tried to cut them all out of her life. But I mostly wanted to talk to Kashmir about going off Google because Google is everywhere in my life. And she was like, yeah, if you're going to cut them out, you've got to do way more than just switching search engines and email addresses. She actually asked a programmer to make, like, a gate that wouldn't let anything Google into her life.

HILL: So it meant that, like, Google Analytics didn't load and Google's trackers didn't load and Google fonts, which is apparently used all over the web, didn't load and Google Maps didn't load, which shut down mapping services and...

FOUNTAIN: Yeah, I would be completely lost without that.

HILL: It was a huge problem.

FOUNTAIN: Kashmir's article was kind of mindblowing because, sure, we all know we use Google a lot, but what I didn't know was just how much of the Internet uses Google's infrastructure to do just about everything. For example, one day, she was trying to go on Dropbox to share a file. So she enters her username, her password, and nothing was happening.

HILL: And it turns out that Dropbox uses this service from Google to determine whether or not you're a bot. And so because I was blocking Google, it looked to Dropbox like I wasn't human, and they wouldn't let me sign in.

FOUNTAIN: Because Kashmir was blocked from fonts and trackers and maps and a million other Google things, her Internet was basically broken.

You're saying that it's, like - it's everywhere.

HILL: Yeah, it's (laughter) - like, basically, blocking Google made me feel like I was back on dial-up Internet in the '90s.

FOUNTAIN: And this was just the Google part of her experiment. Remember; Kashmir did this for all of the tech giants.

HILL: Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple in that order. And then in the last week, I blocked all five at once.

FOUNTAIN: Kashmir's article was so good that after I read it, I was just like, why didn't I think of that?

Can I just say - here at PLANET MONEY, we've sent this around, everyone's looked at it, and we are all so jealous of this project.

HILL: (Laughter) Thanks. You wouldn't be jealous if you had to live through it. It was - I must be a masochist.

FOUNTAIN: Well, thank you for doing it so we didn't have to.

HILL: (Laughter) Thanks for sending me a valentine (laughter).

FOUNTAIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Nick Fountain. Every year, usually around Valentine's Day, we channel our feelings of jealousy and turn them into appreciation - valentines.

(SOUNDBITE OF FREDERIC AUGER AND FLORIAN GAZAN'S "BAISER FATAL")

FOUNTAIN: Today on the show, we're going to send shoutouts to a movie that inspires existential dread, an obscure central bank bureaucrat and a brutal sport that explains a lot about economics.

(SOUNDBITE OF FREDERIC AUGER AND FLORIAN GAZAN'S "BAISER FATAL")

FOUNTAIN: We asked everyone on our team to highlight the things that they loved or were jealous of this year, and, Darian Woods, PLANET MONEY producer, welcome.

DARIAN WOODS, BYLINE: Hey, how's it going?

FOUNTAIN: You were the first to respond, so you're up first. What's your valentine?

WOODS: My valentine's for the Bank of Jamaica, Nick. And I'm not going to say what it is. I'm just going to show you.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) BOJ - committed to the Jamaica and the economy.

FOUNTAIN: So what I'm seeing is a music video about the Jamaican economy featuring, like, a souped up race car and exchange rates.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) So consumers can buy more goods with their cash.

WOODS: She's driving to the central bank and in the background with all this reggae music explaining what the central bank's doing about inflation.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Inflation targeting - the way to go.

FOUNTAIN: What is the backstory behind this?

WOODS: The backstory goes to this guy, Toni Morrison. He's the head of communications for the Jamaican central bank. Last year, he was sitting in the Bank of Jamaica. There were these big economic reforms going on. And Tony has an idea to explain how the bank is managing price inflation. Central banks have got a lot of tools to do this.

FOUNTAIN: Mostly boring speeches, in my experience.

WOODS: That's their primary tool. But Tony, he's got this other idea - music.

TONY MORRISON: Thinking of using music as a tool came somewhat naturally.

FOUNTAIN: What I love about this is that at PLANET MONEY, we have tried so many ways to explain inflation targeting and the psychology behind it. But these guys - but Tony at the central bank of Jamaica - have just, like, figured out a way to get it stuck in my head.

WOODS: They are smashing it. And there is a serious purpose behind using music to explain inflation. Jamaica's struggled with really high price inflation basically since the '60s. At some point in the 1990s, it was over 70 percent.

FOUNTAIN: Wow.

WOODS: So, like, super high price inflation just going up and up and up. But over the last few years, Jamaica has succeeded in driving the inflation rate down. What Tony told me is that he wants to convince the people of Jamaica that this is going to stick.

FOUNTAIN: Because inflation is psychological in a way, right?

WOODS: So Tony knows that inflation is fuelled by this either vicious or virtuous cycle. If people think prices are going to rise a lot, they'll spend their money faster, further speeding up inflation. If they think inflation will be low, that in itself will help slow inflation. Economists call this anchoring inflation expectations.

FOUNTAIN: And so Tony has figured out a way to explain to anyone and everyone that inflation will stay low. Just trust us.

WOODS: Exactly. So these videos are actually in a way pretty important.

FOUNTAIN: I love this so much. Thank you, Darian Woods, for bringing it to our attention.

WOODS: It's been a complete pleasure to sit at my desk watching reggae videos about economics.

FOUNTAIN: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) So consumers can buy more goods with their cash.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Too high or too low, inflation is like the base line in reggae. Inflation is the real heartbeat of the economy.

UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS: (Singing) Inflation targeting - the way to go.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A message from Bank of Jamaica.

FOUNTAIN: OK. Next up, Noel King, what do you got for us?

NOEL KING, BYLINE: This year, I was wildly jealous of a documentary that appeared on Netflix. It's called "FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened." You saw it, too.

FOUNTAIN: On your suggestion.

KING: Yep. It's about a music festival that happened in 2017, which was arguably the most brilliantly hyped music festival in history. It started with a video on Instagram.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: The actual experience exceeds all expectations into something that's hard to put into words.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. It's, like, this slickly produced video - drone footage of this private island. They say it's Pablo Escobar's island.

KING: Then there are all of these models on yachts, and they're gorgeous, and they're playing in the water with pigs, which is weird, but it's cool.

FOUNTAIN: And there's a cool DJ.

KING: It looks awesome.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. It looks like an Instagram influencer's island dream.

KING: So people pay thousands - in some cases, even tens of thousands of dollars - to get tickets to this festival. And then they get off the plane in the Bahamas, and the beach is a parking lot, and the luxury accommodations are damp tents. There are no models anywhere. And there's nothing to eat except cheese sandwiches.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, "FYRE: THE GREATEST PARTY THAT NEVER HAPPENED")

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Turn around. Turn this bus right around.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: There was a disbelief on the bus. A lot of people thought that, oh, you know, maybe we're passing through this area. You know, our villa is just on the other side.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: It was like, oh, my God.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Look at the beds. Look at the beds.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Oh, Jesus. This festival is never happening again. I hope they know that.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah, I remember watching this in real time on Twitter and just kind of laughing about it because basically schadenfreude. But then, we all just sort of filed this away in the cabinet full of millennial failures and moved on with our lives until this documentary came out because it had something kind of special, right?

KING: Yeah, it really did. So Fyre Festival is now a huge legal fiasco. One of the co-founders is in prison. And as a journalist, I could not believe the access they got. They had all of this insider footage, they - the two co-founders copping to the fact that they were selling something that they knew was not real.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, "FYRE: THE GREATEST PARTY THAT NEVER HAPPENED")

BILLY MCFARLAND: We are selling a pipe dream to your average loser...

JA RULE: We're selling a pipe dream to [expletive] buyers.

MCFARLAND: To your average guy in middle America.

KING: So I see the documentary, and I get curious, and I start reading about it to figure out how they pulled this off. And it turns out the reason they had all of this damning footage was because the people who'd been in charge of promoting the Fyre Festival were some of the same people who'd produced the documentary.

FOUNTAIN: So this documentary is ethically compromised, so why are you recommending it to our listeners?

KING: Because it's so dead on about what it is to live in the age of Instagram. Like, these incompetent hucksters can inspire people across the world to be so afraid of missing out that even though the organizers don't have enough money or any preparation or any idea how to deliver, thousands of people fall for it because influencers tell them it's cool.

FOUNTAIN: The documentary is "FYRE: The Greatest Party That Never Happened," and it's hilarious. I, too, recommend it. Thanks, Noel.

KING: Thanks, Nick.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SURF BLAZE")

FOUNTAIN: Most of the valentines that we got, I sort of understood. But this next one, which comes from Cardiff Garcia, the co-host of The Indicator from PLANET MONEY - hello, Cardiff.

CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: Hey, Nick.

FOUNTAIN: I do not understand this at all. Go for it.

GARCIA: (Laughter) So my valentine is to mixed martial arts, the sport of MMA. Nick, if you've never seen it before, here's a little clip of it that I'm going to show you now.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED COMMENTATOR: And then he clinches - exactly what you got to do.

(CROSSTALK)

FOUNTAIN: Oh, oh.

GARCIA: Yeah. That was a - quite a blow - hit him with a right hook coming out of a clinch...

FOUNTAIN: Gnarly.

GARCIA: ...As we say.

FOUNTAIN: So wait. Why do you like this?

GARCIA: I find it kind of endlessly entertaining to watch. I find that there is such a wide range of strategies that these fighters can employ that it actually is a much more kind of intellectual and intriguing sport than a lot of people give it credit for. But the main reason I gave it the valentine is because it is such a controversial business and because the specific controversies of mixed martial arts as a business are so emblematic of the controversies that exist in the overall U.S. economy.

FOUNTAIN: OK. I was raised in a cocoon where I didn't know anything about violence or economics, so...

GARCIA: (Laughter).

FOUNTAIN: ...Play this metaphor out for me.

GARCIA: Start with this - the UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is the main promotional organization of mixed martial arts, the one that puts on fights.

FOUNTAIN: It's the only one I've ever heard of.

GARCIA: Yeah, exactly. And it's much bigger than all of its rivals in part because it bought so many of those rivals on its way to becoming huge. And because of the UFC's size, fighters don't have many options for other promotions where they can fight. So the fighters kind of have to accept, like, the really stringent requirements that the UFC imposes on them, including how much it pays them or, as the fighters might say, how little it pays them.

FOUNTAIN: And you've been walking around the office using this big word to describe this relationship between labor and capital.

GARCIA: Yes - monopsony.

FOUNTAIN: Monopsony - what is that?

GARCIA: So in the labor market, a monopsony is when you have a company that is either the only company that employs all the workers in a certain industry or, more commonly, it's by far the biggest employer. So it just has a lot of power, and a lot of fighters have said that that's the UFC.

FOUNTAIN: All right. So bring it back. How does one guy knocking out another guy relate to the economy writ large?

GARCIA: You mean, I haven't made it obvious yet?

FOUNTAIN: No.

GARCIA: So what critics of the UFC say is that because it is part of a monopsony, it has kind of led to, like, a hollowed out middle class within the sport. So you still have some of these superstar fighters who make a ton of money, sometimes millions of dollars for a given fight. And, obviously, the UFC's owners get to keep a huge chunk of the money that's made in the sport. But then you have all these other fighters. Most of the fighters, in fact, who don't make a ton of money, they have to pay for their own benefits and all kinds of other things out of pocket.

And so you end up with quite a bit of inequality within the sport. And what the critics are saying is that that is a result of the UFC being a monopsonist. And in that sense, it could also mirror what's happening in the U.S. economy...

FOUNTAIN: You know, I was about to say, this is sounding kind of familiar.

GARCIA: Kind of familiar now, right? Because economists are increasingly worried that fewer and fewer companies in some industries are controlling more and more of the workers and that maybe that is responsible for some of the rise in inequality that the U.S. economy has seen in the last few decades.

FOUNTAIN: Cardiff.

GARCIA: Yes.

FOUNTAIN: You do Muay Thai, right?

GARCIA: I do, yeah, for 15 years.

FOUNTAIN: You teach me so much about the economy. Will you teach me how to fight?

GARCIA: If you want, man, sure.

FOUNTAIN: Thanks.

GARCIA: You got it.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BIG WINNER")

FOUNTAIN: All right. So far, we've had music videos, we've had fighting, we've had millennial schadenfreude, but this next one, this next one is a little heady because, yes, PLANET MONEY listeners, we do read books. And Ailsa Chang brought us a book today. What do you got?

AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: I did. It's called "In My Father's House." It's by Fox Butterfield, and I love this book. I just disappeared into it.

FOUNTAIN: What's it about?

CHANG: So this was a book that was less about economics, but it's about a topic I love reporting on - criminal justice.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. We should say, before you were an economics reporter, you reported on criminal justice for, like, half a decade, right?

CHANG: A little more than that.

FOUNTAIN: OK.

CHANG: (Laughter) And what this book does is it explores this question of how criminal behavior can spread across generations within one single family. You know, the question is, is it more nature or more nurture why that happens? And what Fox Butterfield does is he starts with this totally startling statistic, and that is that 5 percent of American families are behind half of all crime in the U.S. I had no idea.

FOUNTAIN: That is wild.

CHANG: It is. I mean, what he illustrates is how crime can spread, like, this contagion moving from parents to children to grandchildren and great-grandchildren. And he focuses on this one family called the Bogles. And he traces them across generations from, like, the 1800s until the present day. And the main character he focuses on is a patriarch named Rooster Bogle.

FOUNTAIN: Great name.

CHANG: (Laughter) Great name - and Rooster is this bad-to-the-bones character. I mean, there's this one scene where he's driving by the Oregon State Correctional Institution with his sons, and he's gazing out at the prison with this sense of nostalgia. And he tells the boys, look carefully because when you grow up, you guys are going to end up there. And he doesn't say it like it's some warning. He says it with pride. Like, it is your destiny. It is your fate to end up in prison one day.

FOUNTAIN: So it sounds like Fox Butterfield falls more on the nurture side of things.

CHANG: Well, he acknowledges that there's nature involved, too. Like, for example, mental illness was passed down generations, and that's genetics to some extent. But what Butterfield does is he builds this case for how much behavior is learned by example because the Bogles, they were this really socially isolated family. They didn't hang out with friends. They didn't hang out with other families. They were just this tight, social unit generation after generation.

So one criminal would be modeling behavior for the next criminal down the line. There was literally a kid who committed his first burglary when he was 4 years old because that's all he saw his dad and brothers doing. And I know all of this sounds incredibly grim, but the book was just so compellingly written. I was engrossed the entire way through.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SOUL SITAR")

FOUNTAIN: The book is by Fox Butterfield. What's it called again?

CHANG: "In My Father's House."

FOUNTAIN: All right. Thanks for the rec, Ailsa.

CHANG: Sure.

FOUNTAIN: Happy Valentine's Day.

CHANG: Happy Valentine's Day.

FOUNTAIN: Shout out to all of you in advance for sending us story ideas. We're planetmoney@npr.org. We put a link to all the valentines at npr.org/money.

CHANG: Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi, Darian Woods and Alex Goldmark produced this episode.

FOUNTAIN: And Bryant Urstadt is our editor. I'm Nick Fountain.

CHANG: And I'm Ailsa Chang. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
Recently, Gizmodo reporter Cashmere Hill tried something nearly impossible.
For journalism.
I wanted to see if it was possible to live without the tech giants.
So Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Google.
She tried to cut them all out of her life.
But I mostly wanted to talk to Cashmere about going off Google, because Google is
everywhere in my life.
And she was like, yeah, if you're going to cut them out, you've got to do way
more than just switching search engines and email addresses.
She actually asked a programmer to make like a gate that wouldn't let anything
Google into her life.
So it meant that like Google Analytics didn't load and Google's trackers didn't
load and Google Fonts, which is apparently used all over the web, didn't load
and Google Maps didn't load, which shut down mapping services.
Yeah, I would be completely lost without that.
It was a huge problem.
Cashmere's article was kind of mind blowing, because sure, we all know we
use Google a lot.
But what I didn't know was just how much of the Internet uses Google's
infrastructure to do just about everything.
For example, one day she was trying to go on Dropbox to share a file.
So she enters her username, her password, and nothing was happening.
And it turns out that Dropbox uses this service from Google to determine
whether or not you're a bot.
And so because I was blocking Google, it looked to Dropbox like I wasn't
human and they wouldn't let me sign in.
Because Cashmere was blocked from fonts and trackers and maps and a million
other Google things, her Internet was basically broken.
You're saying that it's like it's everywhere.
Yeah, it's it's like basically blocking Google made me feel like I was
back on dial up Internet in the 90s.
And this was just the Google part of her experiment.
Remember, Cashmere did this for all of the tech giants.
Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple in that order.
And then the last week, I blocked all five at once.
Cashmere's article was so good that after I read it, I was just like,
why didn't I think of that?
Can I just say here at Planet Money, we've sent this around.
Everyone's looked at it.
And we are all so jealous of this project.
Thanks. You wouldn't be jealous if you had to live through it.
It was I must be a masochist.
Well, thank you for doing it.
So we didn't have to.
Thanks for sending me a Valentine.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Nick Fountain.
Every year, usually around Valentine's Day, we channel our feelings of jealousy
and turn them into appreciation.
Valentine's.
Today on the show, we're going to send shout out to a movie that inspires
existential dread, an obscure central bank bureaucrat
and a brutal sport that explains a lot about economics.
Support for this podcast and the following message come from WeWork.
Vicki Fulop is the co-founder of textile company and WeWork member
Brooklyn and she chose to move her business into a WeWork office,
in part because of WeWork's flexible spaces.
We hope that we can keep growing and we know that WeWork
has really great solutions as companies become midsize and large
and that they would be able to guide us to the best solution.
To learn more about how WeWork supports its members'
growth through flexible workspace offerings, visit we.co slash SpaceMatters.
The U.S. and Iran have been at odds for a long time,
and we tend to think it all started with the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
But that's not the whole story.
This week on ThruLine, we'll take you back to four days in 1953
that changed the U.S.-Iran relationship forever.
ThruLine, where we go back in time to understand the present.
We asked everyone on our team to highlight the things that they loved
or were jealous of this year, and Darian Woods,
Planet Money producer, welcome.
Hey, how's it going?
You were the first to respond, so you're up first.
What's your Valentine?
My Valentine's for the Bank of Jamaica, Nick,
and I'm not going to say what it is, I'm just going to show you.
So what I'm seeing is a music video about the Jamaican economy
featuring a souped-up race car and exchange rates.
She's driving to the central bank.
And in the background, we've got all this reggae music
explaining what the central bank's doing about inflation.
What is the backstory behind this?
The backstory goes to this guy, Tony Morrison.
He's the head of communications for the Jamaican Central Bank.
Last year, he was sitting in the Bank of Jamaica.
There are these big economic reforms going on,
and Tony has an idea to explain how the bank is managing price inflation.
Central banks have got a lot of tools to do this.
Mostly boring speeches, in my experience.
That's their primary tool.
But Tony, he's got this other idea, music.
Thinking of using music as a tool came somewhat naturally.
What I love about this is that at Planet Money,
we have tried so many ways to explain inflation targeting
and the psychology behind it.
But these guys, but Tony at the Central Bank of Jamaica,
have just figured out a way to get it stuck in my head.
They are smashing it.
And there is a serious purpose behind using music to explain inflation.
Jamaica's struggled with really high price inflation
basically since the 60s.
At some point in the 1990s, it was over 70%.
Like super high price inflation just going up and up and up.
But over the last few years,
Jamaica has succeeded in driving the inflation rate down.
What Tony told me is that he wants to convince
the people of Jamaica that this is going to stick.
Because inflation is psychological in a way, right?
So Tony knows that inflation is fueled
by this either vicious or virtuous cycle.
If people think price is going to rise a lot,
they'll spend their money faster,
further speeding up inflation.
If they think inflation will be low,
that in itself will help slow inflation.
Economists call this anchoring inflation expectations.
And so Tony has figured out a way to explain
to anyone and everyone that inflation will stay low,
just trust us.
Exactly.
So these videos are actually in a way pretty important.
I love this so much.
Thank you, Darren Woods for bringing it to our attention.
It's been a complete pleasure to sit at my desk
watching reggae videos about economics.
So consumers can buy more goods with them cash.
Too high or too low.
Inflation is like the bass line in reggae music.
Inflation is the real hobby of the economy.
Inflation targeting the way to go.
A message from Bank of Jamaica.
Okay, next up, Noel King, what do you got for us?
This year, I was wildly jealous of a documentary
that appeared on Netflix.
It's called Fire,
The Greatest Party That Never Happened.
You saw it too.
On your suggestion.
Yep, it's about a music festival that happened in 2017,
which was arguably the most brilliantly hyped
music festival in history.
It started with a video on Instagram.
The actual experience exceeds all expectations.
It is something that's hard to put into words.
Yeah, it's like this slickly produced video,
drone footage of this private island.
They say it's Pablo Escobar's island.
Then there are all of these models on yachts
and they're gorgeous
and they're playing in the water with pigs,
which is weird, but it's cool.
And there's a cool DJ.
It looks awesome.
Yeah, it looks like an Instagram influencer's
island dream.
So people pay thousands, in some cases,
even tens of thousands of dollars
to get tickets to this festival.
And then they get off the plane in the Bahamas
and the beach is a parking lot
and the luxury accommodations are damp tents.
There are no models anywhere
and there's nothing to eat except cheese sandwiches.
Turn around.
Turn this bus right around.
There was a disbelief on the bus.
A lot of people thought that, oh, you know,
maybe we're passing through this area.
You know, our villas are just on the other side.
It was like, oh my God.
Look at the beds.
Oh, Jesus.
This festival is never happening again.
I hope they know that.
Yeah, I remember watching this in real time on Twitter
and just kind of laughing about it
because basically schadenfreude.
But then we all just sort of filed this away
in the cabinet full of millennial failures
and moved on with our lives
until this documentary came out
because it had something kind of special, right?
Yeah, it really did.
So Fire Festival is now a huge legal fiasco.
One of the co-founders is in prison.
And as a journalist,
I could not believe the access they got.
They had all of this insider footage.
They had the two co-founders copping to the fact
that they were selling something
that they knew was not real.
We are selling a pipe dream to average people.
We're selling a pipe dream to fiasco.
You're an average guy from the middle America.
So I see the documentary and I get curious
and I start reading about it
to figure out how they pulled this off.
And it turns out the reason
they had all of this damning footage
was because the people who'd been in charge
of promoting the Fire Festival
were some of the same people
who'd produced the documentary.
So this documentary is ethically compromised.
So why are you recommending it to our listeners?
Because it's so dead on
about what it is to live in the age of Instagram.
Like these incompetent hucksters
can inspire people across the world
to be so afraid of missing out
that even though the organizers don't have enough money
or any preparation or any idea how to deliver,
thousands of people fall for it
because influencers tell them it's cool.
The documentary is Fire,
the greatest party that never happened
and it's hilarious.
I too recommend it.
Thanks, Noelle.
Thanks, Nick.
Most of the Valentine's that we got,
I sort of understood.
But this next one which comes from Cardiff Garcia,
the cohost of the Indicator from Planet Money.
Hello, Cardiff.
Hey, Nick.
I do not understand this at all.
Go for it.
So my Valentine is to Mixed Martial Arts,
the sport of MMA.
Nick, if you've never seen it before,
here's a little clip of it that I'm gonna show you.
So many clinches.
Exactly what you gotta do.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah, that was quite a blow.
We hit him with a right hook coming out of a clinch.
Gnarly.
As we say.
So wait, why do you like this?
I find it kind of endlessly entertaining to watch.
I find that there is such a wide range of strategies
that these fighters can employ
that it actually is a much more kind of intellectual
and intriguing sport
than a lot of people give it credit for.
But the main reason I gave it the Valentine
is because it is such a controversial business.
And because the specific controversies
of Mixed Martial Arts as a business
are so emblematic of the controversies that exist
in the overall US economy.
Okay, I was raised in a cocoon
where I didn't know anything about violence or economics.
So play this metaphor out for me.
Start with this.
The UFC, the Ultimate Fighting Championship
is the main promotional organization of Mixed Martial Arts.
It's the only one I've ever heard of.
The one that puts on fights.
Yeah, exactly.
And it's much bigger than all of its rivals
in part because it bought so many of those rivals
on its way to becoming huge.
And because of the UFC size,
fighters don't have many options
for other promotions where they can fight.
So the fighters kind of have to accept
like the really stringent requirements
that the UFC imposes on them,
including how much it pays them,
or as the fighters might say, how little it pays them.
And you've been walking around the office
using this big word to describe this relationship
between labor and capital.
Yes, monopsony.
Monopsony, what is that?
So in the labor market,
a monopsony is when you have a company
that is either the only company
that employs all the workers in a certain industry,
or more commonly, it's by far the biggest employer.
So it just has a lot of power.
And a lot of fighters have said that that's the UFC.
All right, so bring it back.
How does one guy knocking out another guy
relate to the economy writ large?
You mean I haven't made it obvious yet?
No.
So what critics of the UFC say is that
because it is part of a monopsony,
it has kind of led to like a hollowed out middle class
within the sport.
So you still have some of these superstar fighters
who make a ton of money,
sometimes millions of dollars for a given fight.
And obviously the UFC's owners
get to keep a huge chunk of the money
that's made in the sport.
But then you have all these other fighters,
most of the fighters in fact,
who don't make a ton of money,
they have to pay for their own benefits
and all kinds of other things out of pocket.
And so you end up with quite a bit of inequality
within the sport.
And what the critics are saying
is that that is a result of the UFC being a monopsonist.
And in that sense,
it could also mirror what's happening
in the US economy.
Yeah, I was about to say,
this is sounding kind of familiar.
Kind of familiar now, right?
Because economists are increasingly worried
that fewer and fewer companies in some industries
are controlling more and more of the workers.
And that maybe that is responsible
for some of the rise in inequality
that the US economy has seen in the last few decades.
Cardiff.
Yes.
You do Muay Thai, right?
I do, yeah.
For 15 years.
You teach me so much about the economy.
Will you teach me how to fight?
If you want, man, sure.
Thanks.
You got it.

And check out Planet Money's other podcast, The Indicator.
On one recent episode,
we look into the invention of the government bond
and what it had to do with appeasing a bloodthirsty mob.
They chased him down the street and executed him.
Oh.
The Indicator from Planet Money,
your daily economic crash course.
All right, so far we've had music videos,
we've had fighting, we've had millennials shot in for it,
but this next one, this next one is a little heady
because yes, Planet Money listeners, we do read books
and Elsa Chang brought us a book today.
What do you got?
I did, it's called In My Father's House.
It's by Fox Butterfield and I love this book.
I just disappeared into it.
What's it about?
So this was a book that was less about economics
but it's about a topic I love reporting on,
criminal justice.
Yeah, we should say before you're an economics reporter,
you reported on criminal justice
for like half a decade, right?
A little more than that.
Okay.
And what this book does is it explores this question
of how criminal behavior can spread across generations
within one single family.
The question is, is it more nature
or more nurture why that happens?
And what Fox Butterfield does is he starts
with this totally startling statistic
and that is that 5% of American families
are behind half of all crime in the U.S.
I had no idea.
That is wild.
It is.
I mean, what he illustrates is how crime can spread
like this contagion, moving from parents to children
to grandchildren and great grandchildren.
And he focuses on this one family called the Bogle's
and he traces them across generations
from like the 1800s until the present day.
And the main character he focuses on
is a patriarch named Rooster Bogle.
Great name.
Great name.
And Rooster is this bad to the bones character.
There's this one scene where he's driving
by the Oregon State Correctional Institution with his sons
and he's gazing out at the prison
with this sense of nostalgia.
And he tells the boys, look carefully
because when you grow up,
you guys are gonna end up there.
And he doesn't say it like it's some warning.
He says it with pride.
It is your destiny.
It is your fate to end up in prison one day.
So it sounds like Fox Butterfield falls more
on the nurture side of things.
Well, he acknowledges that there's nature involved too.
Like, for example, mental illness
was passed down generations
and that's genetics to some extent.
But what Butterfield does is he builds this case
for how much behavior is learned by example.
Because the Bogle's,
they were this really socially isolated family.
They didn't hang out with friends.
They didn't hang out with other families.
They were just this tight social unit
generation after generation.
So one criminal would be modeling behavior
for the next criminal down the line.
There was literally a kid who committed his first burglary
when he was four years old.
Because that's all he saw his dad and brothers doing.
And I know all of this sounds incredibly grim,
but the book was just so compellingly written.
I was engrossed the entire way through.
The book is by Fox Butterfield.
What's it called again?
In My Father's House.
All right, thanks for the rec, Elsa.
