There's an industry of people working to eliminate bad police behavior. They're not activists or protestors. They're insurers.

What happens when a police department can no longer afford its bad behavior?

In 2013, Tony Miranda was brought in to lead a police department in crisis. Bad behavior by a handful of officers had led to investigations and lawsuits with costs in the millions of dollars. That was more than the city could cover.

#901: Bad Cops Are Expensive

He knew change would be difficult. But he also knew he had a powerful ally on his side: insurance coverage.

On today's show, the overlooked force motivating police departments to reform bad behavior — not protests and picket signs, but spreadsheets and actuaries. This is the story of how Irwindale, California turned its police department around.

**faster whisper:**
Tony Miranda is the kind of police officer who makes you want to follow the rules more because you just don't want to disappoint him
Not so much because you're scared of him physically. I'm only like five six and a half five seven out of the Academy. I was
140 pounds wet
So I was challenged at on almost every stop every arrest and they're like, okay
Officer take me to jail. I like to see you do it
So Tony says he really had to learn how to use his wits and he pretty quickly made a name for himself
About 20 years into his career Tony caught the attention of a nearby police department
They wanted him to be the new police chief in Irwindale, California. Just east of LA. It's like a well-kept secret
There's only 1,400 residents and a lot of them are second and third generation Irwind aliens
They've just been there forever
Apparently people who moved to Irwindale rarely leave
It's this town where everyone seems to know each other and it has lots of perks for a town that size a modern rec
Center really nice parks their own little library and they're able to provide
Medical and and benefits for the residents meaning like if you're a resident of Irwindale the city gives you health insurance
It's not comprehensive, but it's something that's like a premier little city
So there's a lot of civic pride in that little community
So lots of pros to becoming the police chief in Irwindale
With one big caveat the city was known for the police department because it garnered the most news
I'm talking front page news news at 6 news at 5 news at 11 and all negative
We're talking about some
serious ugly
Haneous crimes like one officer had been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during an early morning traffic stop
another accused of embezzlement and
There was a third officer. It was under investigation for having on sex with minors. So
I'm not even talking dark cloud. It cast a black cloud over the whole community
All of these scandals weren't just taking an emotional toll on this tight-knit little town
They were taking a financial toll
these scandals cost Irwindale millions of dollars in legal fees and
It wasn't just the city footing the bill
That is what turned this from the police reform story that you usually hear one about protests and activists
Into an entirely different one a version. We had never heard before
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Sarah Gonzales today on the show
Tony Miranda goes to Irwindale
He tries to fix the police department and he has a powerful ally at his back this entire
Industry that puts a price tag on police behavior a sort of shadow regulator with the power to change police departments
Insurance, this is the story of what happens when a police department can no longer afford its bad behavior

Tony Miranda never thought that it would be easy to clean up the Irwindale Police Department
But as he walks into the building on his first day, he starts to really understand what he's in for
Picture low lights, a building that was built in about 1985
A lot of the walls are cinder block. They're all dark gray
And there's no art, posters or anything on the walls
I'm like, this is really sad. It's depressing in here
There are a lot of basic things that most police departments should have
Like there are these things called MDTs
They're these fancy computer screen type things that police have in their cars to track 911 calls
Tells them where to go, what they're responding to
And Tony's asking his guys, why are there only a few of these and a bunch of them broken?
And I said, well, if you're not using an MDT, how do you get to calls?
And one of the patrolmen holds up his palm and he says like this, Chief
And I look at his palm and I'm going, that's unacceptable
And so I could see where he had gone to a call, scratched it out, gone to a call and scratched it out
He's writing the calls on his palm of his hand with his ink pen
He's like, okay, we are really starting from the bottom here
And if we have any hope of fixing this, this team will have to band together
And those really bad officers, the ones wrapped up in the expensive lawsuits
They had either been fired or were on leave while they were being investigated
But if Tony wants to prevent any new problems, he needs to fix the culture
The administration and the officers just could not get along
So there was a lot of internal affairs investigations
There were 30 employees and 14 internal affairs investigations
And these are not just people in the community complaining about bad cops
These were cops complaining against other cops and administrators complaining against cops
It was just unreal, I've never experienced anything like it
Tony quickly realizes that the same thing that makes this small town great is also what has made it such a hard place to change
Everyone knows each other, so when there's a fight in the police department
The cop might just like call his uncle on the city council
The fights there are entrenched and they're personal, almost tribal
So Tony thinks we need some new blood
Tony calls his leadership team together and tells them, I'm hiring a new number two
And it's not going to be any of you
It was really quiet and one sergeant stands up and says, you know what, chief?
The police officers association is not going to stand for that
They're going to call for a vote of no confidence
On you?
On me, yeah, the new guy
Right off the bat, basically, hey city council, fire this guy
So Tony is standing there at home of his five foot six self looking straight at a mutiny
And this may have been where the story ended
But Tony had more than his wits this time
He knows change is coming, whether they like it or not, because of their insurance authority
In some situations insurers have a lot of power over a police department
Right, most small or midsize police departments have some kind of insurance
In part because police departments get sued all the time for all kinds of things, justified or not
And insurance helps cover the risk
Big cities like Los Angeles, they get enough taxpayer money that they can basically self insure
Like set aside some money for a rainy day or a lawsuit
But smaller cities like Irwindale, they actually buy insurance
Through either a private insurer or something called a municipal risk pool
A municipal risk pool is kind of like a family car insurance plan
Irwindale is on the same insurance plan as a bunch of other police departments in California
And if one of those police departments gets in a wreck, everyone's premium can go up
They call them contributions
And the worst part about this plan is that everyone knows it's your fault, Irwindale
You're the bad teenage driver in this family
So they needed to either get a handle on things or cancel their policy
That was it
Those are the two options
Yes, or you need to shop for another one and you'll be paying some premium rates
That's if you can even find another insurer willing to take you on
If you can't, you might lose your police department altogether
Because one incident could raise taxes or even bankrupt a small town
One wrongful conviction, one use of excess force
And Tony wanted to make sure his rank and file understood the stakes were that high
So he brings them all together and says, let me tell you guys a little story about Maywood, California
You know Maywood, about 20 miles west of us
Their police department also had a lot of problems
And our risk pool, our family insurance plan got tired of footing the bill
First, Maywood got a warning
They were told they needed to fix it, they didn't, and they lost their insurance
They can no longer be police officers because of the amount of exposure they have
The whole police department shut down
The city of Maywood couldn't bear the risk of having police without the insurance authority
And Tony tells his officers, I was there at the end, the day they shut down
I remember it
Just before midnight
All of the Maywood police officers line up in the parking lot, dressed in their finest
So they're standing there, some are already 28, 25 years on
And they're about to lose their career and their jobs and they know this
And it's like being at a funeral, everybody's crying in the audience
And these grown men are standing there weeping
One by one, each officer steps forward, picks up the police radio
And what the chief does is have them do one last radio transmission
Saying that they're going out of service
Unit 1 Charlie
1 Charlie, go ahead
These are recordings of those final transmissions
1 Charlie, advising 10-7, end of watch
It's been an honor and it's been a privilege, 10-7
1 Charlie, 10-7
And they had to do a final salute
And then he takes their badge and takes their, they put their portable radio in a box
The last one to go is the police chief
He salutes and then he signs off for the last time
This is Chief Frank Hauptman of the Maywood Cudahy Police Department
This will be our last transmission
Maywood police will now be 10-7, end of watch
God bless all of you
So I shared that story with them and I said I've seen bigger, stronger men than you all in this room
Broken down in tears
Don't think for a minute that it will not happen
I've seen it happen
Tony says this is the moment after he told that story
That he started to notice a shift at the Irwindale Police Department
This was real, this was an exterior threat that could close the Irwindale Police Department down
This was real
Irwindale's insurer had made it very clear
Irwindale PD had to follow a performance improvement plan
They had 8 things to fix and 18 months to fix them
The clock was ticking

Quick note, I did reach out to Irwindale's insurer and other people in town
And many of them were willing to talk but said that a city official had told them not to speak with us
However, we verified the story with some folks who just didn't want to be recorded
And with public documents
Okay, back to the story
For a long time, a lot of police departments weren't allowed to buy insurance
People thought it would create moral hazard
Basically, if your risky behavior is covered by someone else, you might do more of it
But then, in the 1960s, there were a few Supreme Court rulings that gave police more rules
You have the right to remain silent
Anything you do say can and will be used against you in a court of law
That's right, Miranda writes
Shout out law and order there
And all of this made it much easier to sue the police
So, moral hazard be damned, smaller police departments felt like they had to get insurance
There's a whole big, powerful, well-financed industry that is trying to influence police behavior
This is John Rapoport
He's a law professor at the University of Chicago
And he wrote one of the first papers looking at the influence of insurance on police
In the mix of a discussion that is often understandably heated and emotional
Insurers look at police departments through the cold, hard lens of an actuary
Does this police behavior create risk?
If yes, let's reduce it
It's a business relationship
They're able to say, hey, we're actually not protesters or activists
We're not telling you you're bad
We're just telling you that your numbers are worse than they were last year
And we want to bring them back down to where they were
The goal of these insurers is not just to win lawsuits
It's to be so above board that nobody even brings a lawsuit
So often, insurers issue guidelines that are more strict than the law
Take strip searches
After the Supreme Court said police can strip search pretty much anyone for any arrest
This one insurance was like, yeah, we're going to give our police some restrictions
And they added things like you should have someone of the same gender conduct the strip search
And you should do it in a sanitary setting
And those are things that actually aren't in the Supreme Court's opinion
But at the same time, I think the insurer was using common sense to think, how would this look to a jury?
And if you really want to make sure people are behaving the way they should, sometimes you got to be proactive
One insurer said that they send an insurance representative to hang out at cop bars and just listen to gossip
I mean, if they do hear anything alarming, they report it back to the insurer
Everyone's vying for that job
I'll go, you know, if you really need me to go drink in whatever town
I know
And John says, look, they don't just leave cops out there hoping they don't mess up
They also try to help them out in the most insurance way possible
Doing things like updating police manuals or giving them training
And if the department does get better, there are rewards like lower premiums
So back in Irwindale, Tony has his to-do list
The eight things that his family insurance plan has said he has to change in 18 months
And Tony added a few things himself to help fix the culture
He calls all his people together and he steps up to the whiteboard and says, all right, this is how we're going to fix this
I said, we are going to treat this like a plane crash
A plane just crashed in Irwindale
You're all paramedics
Let's triage this
Let's start with the most essential equipment
Remember those monitors, the ones that tell cops where to go when they're responding to a 911 call?
Irwindale fixed them up and bought some more
The stuff that would help reduce risk, you know, going on a 911 call
It's pretty important that your sweaty pump doesn't turn the nine into a three or a six
They fixed up their patrol cars, fixed the cameras in their cars, got workplace harassment training and more training
I started sending them to community-based policing courses, officer safety
But the main change was that Tony had to run almost everything he did by the insurance authority
Like if he wanted to discipline someone or fire someone, he needed their permission
We met every, I think it was every Wednesday at 10 a.m.
Without, I mean, you cleared your calendar, you're going to be there
How did that feel to have to run your things by an insurance company?
Well, it was not common practice, that's for sure
And to a certain degree, I felt second guess
But at the end of the day, it just adds more credibility
Because it wasn't just this outside chief saying, this is what we're going to do
It's also our insurance company who could make us or break us
Tony says they didn't really overrule his decisions
They just made him explain why he wanted something, and as long as it made sense, they were cool with it
Was there a point at which you thought, this might work?
I think it was in year two actually, in my second year on the 4th of July
It was Irwindale's Independence Day party and all the cops had to work
So Tony brought a grill, made everyone tacos, and somewhere in the middle of it, Tony took a picture
And the day was over and I went home and I looked at that picture on my cell phone
And I looked at their faces and they were all smiling, and I hadn't seen that anywhere
Now, Irwindale is just one police department in one small town with a specific set of issues
If you step back though and ask whether insurance is an effective way to improve police departments overall
John Rappaport, that law professor, says sometimes
The issues they care about most are the expensive ones
Things that might generate large payouts like excessive force
But the less legally expensive the issue, the less likely insurance is to address it
Because insurers aren't making moral judgments
For them, police reform is a business
For Irwindale, pressure from an insurance authority seems to have helped
18 months after Tony showed up under that black cloud, the insurance authority declared Irwindale new and improved
They could keep their coverage, they could stay a police department
And Tony says he doesn't think they could have done it without that performance improvement plan, that PIP
I have to say, without that PIP, the officers would continue to be aggressive, they would continue to fight
Absent of the PIP, I'm not sure if Irwindale would be here today
I'm really not sure, I'm not sure
Tony decided his work was done and he handed off the department to a new chief
I'm handing you the keys to a Cadillac, please take care of it
These guys are good guys, and you're very lucky, you're lucky
What were you driving when you got there, like a 1972 Gremlin?
It was like a pinto on two cylinders, it was bad
