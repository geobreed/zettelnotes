The story of the day the Federal Reserve got its independence and the fight—an actual physical fight—to keep it.

In the years before 1951, the Federal Reserve took orders from the Treasury, and by extension, from the President. The President would request that interest rates remain low, and the Fed would oblige.

#898: Happy Fed Independence Day

But this became a problem. Low interest rates are great for people to borrow money to buy stuff, and for businesses to grow and hire people. But low interest rates also drive up inflation. And a big part of the Federal Reserve's job is to keep inflation low.

So the Fed decided it needed to reclaim its power. And on March 4, 1951 it finally did. The Fed was officially free. Sort of. On today's show, how the Fed won its independence and then fought to defend it.

**faster whisper:**
Late last year, President Trump was making very strong statements about what the Federal
Reserve should do, or more specifically, what the Fed should not do.
He did not want the Fed to raise interest rates again.
Right.
The day before the Fed met in December, the president tweeted that it was incredible
that, quote, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike.
Then the next day, he warned the Fed not to, quote, make yet another mistake.
The Fed's love low interest rates because they make it easy for people to borrow money,
to buy stuff, and for businesses to borrow and hire people.
But low interest rates also drive up inflation, and part of the Federal Reserve's job is
to keep inflation low.
The day after Trump's tweet, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was appointed by President
Trump, announced that the Fed had in fact raised interest rates.
He did the opposite of what the president wanted him to do.
The Federal Reserve is independent.
And this is a phrase you will hear, Fed independence.
And what happened in December?
President saying, don't raise rates.
And his Fed chair saying, we raised rates.
That's Fed independence.
And there is a story of how Fed independence came to be and a specific day that I am
henceforth going to call Fed Independence Day.
And good news, everybody, you've got three days.
It's the 4th of March.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Noelle King.
And I'm Kenny Malone.
Today on the show, the story of how the Fed got its independence and how it had
to fight to keep it.
And by fight, we mean literal fight.
A president and his Fed chair got in a physical altercation.

We often think of luck as something random, unpredictable, but
what if we actually have more control than we think we do?
A lot of it has to do with taking tiny risks.
It's getting out of your comfort zone.
It's paying attention to things that other people don't pay attention to.
Ideas on what makes us lucky on the TED Radio Hour from NPR.
OK, Fed Independence Day, as I'm calling it, is because of what happened
in this country on March 4th, 1951.
In the years before 1951, the Fed took orders from the Treasury,
basically from the president.
We were fighting World War Two.
And so when the president said to the Fed chair, you better set interest
rates so it's cheap for the government to borrow money to pay for the war.
The Fed said, yeah, OK.
But after the war, inflation started rising and the Fed chair said
to the president, look, it is our job to deal with inflation.
You need to let us raise interest rates.
President Truman said no.
And by early 1951, inflation had hit 21%.
The price of everything that Americans bought was rising by 21% a year.
So Truman finally gave in.
On March 4th, 1951, his Treasury Department
agreed to leave the Fed alone.
The Fed, not the president, would set interest rates for the country.
The Fed was free, sort of.
Yeah, this agreement was known as the Treasury-Fed Accord.
And the Treasury-Fed Accord is not a law or even an official rule.
This really was just a handshake deal.
The president, at that moment, was agreeing to not mess with the Fed.
So the real test would come when another president came in and decided,
I don't like this agreement.
Bill, I just want to thank you for your most thoughtful and generous
letter, and I appreciate it so much.
This is President Lyndon B. Johnson.
And this phone call happened just a few days
after Johnson became president in 1963, which was just a few days
after John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
Johnson had been thrown into office.
And so he started checking in with all the important people.
And in this call, he is introducing himself
to Fed Chair William McChesney Martin.
What Johnson's saying in this call is, you're the expert.
I'm here to listen.
Well, I thank you, Patriot, and I'm mighty glad you're around.
As far as we know, this is the first call between President Johnson
and Chairman Martin.
Sounds cordial, but their relationship would
deteriorate spectacularly.
Well, Bob, why don't we start by having you introduce yourself?
Sure.
I'm Bob Remner.
I authored a book on William McChesney Martin.
I have kind of the corner on William McChesney Martin.
It's the only book out there.
Bob's going to be our guide through the Lyndon B. Johnson
William McChesney Martin story.
So here goes.
Johnson and Martin were two very different types of people.
Johnson was this tall, imposing guy raised in Texas.
Well, Lyndon Johnson had a reputation
for being a manipulator.
He remembered slights, he exchanged favors,
and he played them like fiddles.
He was a man who did all the things
to get people to do what he wanted them to do.
That's correct.
Bill Martin wasn't like that.
A journalist once called him the happy Puritan.
His father was in banking.
Martin looked like a banker.
He was skinny.
He had rimless glasses.
Later on in his life, he became friends and tennis
partners with that biographer, Bob Remner.
Did Bill Martin ever tell you any jokes?
Any jokes?
You know, not a joke teller.
And I remember finding in his papers a file saying,
humor, and it didn't have anything in it.
Honest to God.
Well, is it true that William McChesney Martin loved
more than anything in the world
trying to explain the Federal Reserve to people?
Absolutely.
Really?
Absolutely.
What were some of the analogies or metaphors he used?
What did he compare it to?
Probably the most famous was his comment
that the Federal Reserve's role was really
to take the punch bowl away just as the party got going.
The punch bowl analogy.
Business journalists use this all the time.
And the idea is low interest rates
are like the booze at a party.
And the Fed's job is to be the responsible adult
to raise interest rates, take the punch bowl away
before the party gets out of hand,
before inflation starts to take off.
OK, so when Lyndon Johnson becomes president,
Bill Martin was already the Fed chair.
And one of the first things that Johnson does
is to push a big package of tax cuts
that Kennedy had been working on.
Johnson told Congress that passing these cuts
was a way to honor Kennedy, and it worked.
The cuts passed.
And then there were the two wars.
Johnson inherited the Vietnam War from Kennedy,
and then he got us in deeper.
And at home, Johnson launched the War on Poverty.
This is where Medicare and Medicaid came from
and tons of other social programs.
So these two wars were expensive.
Because of all this government spending,
a lot of money was heating up the U.S. economy.
Plus, people are getting these tax breaks,
so it's getting even hotter.
This is great for Johnson because people are happy
and Johnson wants eventually to be reelected.
But William McChesney Martin is watching all of this
and thinking, huh, this is the kind of stuff
the Fed needs to pay very close attention to
because this kind of spending
could very likely lead to inflation.
So he starts warning Johnson, we are in serious trouble.
I think the Fed is going to need to raise interest rates.
We are headed for, quote, an inflationary mess.
And Johnson is like, yeah,
well, I've talked to other smart people
and, quote, they don't agree with you.
This is the classic fight.
The Fed wants to raise interest rates
because it's worried about the economy in the long run
and the president wants low interest rates
because they are good for the economy now.
The stage was set for problems.
So the question is, what can a Fed chairman do
in this particular case?
What did Martin do to try to telegraph the Fed's intent
and the concerns the Fed has?
So the one thing they can do is give speeches.
So we have a frustrated Fed chair.
And as it happens,
he gets an elegantly timed invitation,
which leads to, as far as we can tell,
the worst commencement day speech in history.
Yeah, Bill Martin gets invited to Columbia University
to speak at the graduation day luncheon.
So you can imagine campuses buzzing
with bright-eyed kids in powder blue caps and gowns
and you know how commencement day speeches usually sound.
They're all, oh, the places you'll go.
That is not what Martin does.
No, he starts his address not by saying,
follow your dreams or some such.
He says, when economic prospects are at their brightest,
the dangers of complacency and recklessness are greatest.
And then he ups the ante by saying,
we find disquieting similarities
between our present prosperity and the fabulous 20s.
And here's a Federal Reserve chairman talking about,
we are in a situation today
that is very much like the situation
that led to the Great Depression.
Now, that's pretty tough stuff.
So what is he saying?
What is he saying to these kids exactly?
Like we're, if we're not careful?
He's, no, he's really speaking to the president.
And that's the problem for the kids.
This moment where the Fed chair
is actually saying the words,
danger signals and Great Depression in the same speech
makes the front page of the New York Times the next day.
The stock market plunges.
And when President Johnson gets word of this,
he is seething.
He asks his attorney general, can I fire this guy?
And the attorney general disappointed him by saying,
there's no way you can unseat him except for cause.
And unfortunately,
policy differences do not constitute a cause.
So Mr. President, you're stuck with this man.
A guy like Johnson, that must have been,
that must have chafed.
Oh, well, I mean, nobody told Lyndon Johnson no, nobody.
Think about this now from Johnson's point of view.
William McChesney Martin and the Fed
have an enormous amount of power.
They get to decide how much it's gonna cost
to get a mortgage or a student loan.
A handful of technocrats in the Federal Reserve
get to make those decisions.
Not me, the president of the United States,
who is a representative of all the people.
And to be fair, some people today
feel exactly the same way.
Why do these unelected technocrats get so much power?
So after Bill Martin's Columbia speech,
Johnson is furious.
He gets on the phone and starts talking to people
about his Fed chair, about Bill freaking Martin.
Hello.
Morning.
Hi, Joe.
How are you?
You'll hear Johnson in this call saying like,
I can't control Bill Martin.
He has control of the board.
I've met with him half a dozen times.
I can't do anything.
Well, I'm doing everything I know how.
I've met with Martin half a dozen times.
I haven't got control of that board.
He's got control of it.
So Johnson is livid,
but he's starting to understand
that Martin is going to do this.
He's going to raise the interest rate.
So instead of begging Martin not to,
he begs Martin to wait,
wait until Johnson can pass a budget in the new year.
Big priority for the president.
And this is all happening in the fall of 1965,
and Johnson slips into full manipulator mode.
He's about to have surgery,
and he even tries to use that as leverage.
Johnson was going in to have his gallbladder taken out,
and he said, you wouldn't raise rates on me.
Would you, Bill, while I'm in the hospital?
And Martin said, oh, no, Mr. President,
we'll wait until you're out.
So Martin does wait, but he doesn't wait long.
On December 3rd, Martin's Fed takes a vote
on whether to raise the interest rate by half a percent,
and they vote to do it.
Johnson is at his Texas ranch,
recovering from surgery,
when he finds out what Martin has done.
He can't control him.
He has worked as hard as he can.
He's threatened, and yet Martin has gone and done this,
and he can't believe it.
So Johnson summons Martin to the ranch.
Martin flies down.
He's called into Johnson's office.
We don't know exactly what was said in that office,
but here is Bob Bremner's description.
And Johnson is just fit to be tied, starts right off.
You know, this is something
that can affect my entire term.
You knew that this would have this impact on me,
and yet you went right ahead.
You ran a rapier right through me.
You and the Federal Reserve
had put yourself above my presidency,
and you totally disregard my wishes and my policy goals.
It's a despicable thing to do.
And then there is a reference to the fact
that Johnson was so angry
that he pushed Martin against the wall.
Physically pushed him against the wall?
Physically pushed him against the wall.
The President of the United States
laid hands on his Fed chair?
Yes.
And what does Martin do?
Well, Martin says,
Mr. President, we have not put ourselves
over your presidency.
I told you I was going to do this.
I told you personally.
I told your administration that we were going to do this.
I've given you a lot of advance notice.
But I do have the very strong conviction
that the Federal Reserve Act
placed the responsibility for interest rates
with the Federal Reserve Board.
This is one of those few occasions
where the Federal Reserve decision has to be final.
This is a huge moment, and here's why.
Remember Fed Independence Day, March 4, 1951?
That Treasury-Fed accord was really just a handshake deal.
This moment tested the handshake deal.
William McChesney Martin is standing up
to Lyndon B. Johnson and saying,
no, this agreement is real.
The Fed is not going to be bullied
into doing what the President wants.
I mean, if you want one single moment
when the Federal Reserve defined its independence
and what that meant to somebody who was out
to squash it as much as possible, that's it.
The thing about Fed Independence Day
is that it's really not just one day.
There's the Treasury-Fed accord, the 4th of March.
There's the day Johnson shoved Martin
for acting independently, the 6th of December,
and it didn't stop there.
In the years after Martin left the Fed,
inflation started going way up until another Fed chair,
Paul Volcker, had to assert Fed independence again.
He raised interest rates even though farmers
were blockading the Fed with their tractors.
And then in a smaller way, we saw this again in December,
when the President of the United States
sort of warned his Fed chair, Jerome Powell,
on Twitter not to raise interest rates,
and Powell and the Fed did it anyway.
It may sound like we're saying,
maybe every day is Fed Independence Day,
but no, it is the 4th of March, and after the break,
I have some very serious thoughts
about how to celebrate it.
He does, you're gonna wanna stick around
until after the credits.

The NPR Politics Podcast,
what you need to know right when it happens.
All right, Noel King, I just wanna try something
that I've always sort of dreamed of.
Shoot.
Okay, so you know how on the 4th of July
for Independence Day, NPR has a bunch of its hosts
read the Declaration of Independence on the air
with like sweet music underneath it.
Yeah, I've done it.
You've done it.
For the 4th of March, for Fed Independence Day,
we should be reading the Treasury Fed Accord,
the Fed Declaration of Independence, if you will.
No, I will not.
Okay, we won't,
but I do think we should go get the old document
that was released on March 4th, 1951,
announcing the Treasury Fed Accord,
and I think what we should do
is we should get the other hosts
and get that sweet music
and have them read this NPR style.
All right, I'm in, let's do it.
Okay, this is super wonky, but here goes.
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve System.
Have reached full accord with respect to debt management.
And monetary policies to be pursued
in furthering their common purpose.
To assure the successful financing
of the government's requirements.
And.
At the same time.
To minimize monetization of the public debt.
That's it.
That's it.
It's one sentence.
Kind of confusing, too.
It was basically a press release.
Yeah.
But I am going to propose that henceforth
we shall read the Treasury Fed Accord release
every March 4th on Planet Money
or as close as we can get to it.
What do you think, Noel?
Good.
Yeah?
Let's do it.
But we also have been trying to come up
with a ritual for everyone else
to celebrate Fed Independence Day
and we would like your help.
We're looking for something.
Yeah, something with a dollar bill maybe.
Something about how it holds buying power over time.
Maybe something with a punch bowl.
Anyway, come up with a ritual.
Take a picture of it.
Put it on social media and tag us.
We're at Planet Money.
And we're gonna put some of our favorites

A very, very, very special thanks this week
to John Weinberg from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond for walking me through hours
and hours and hours of the Fed's history.
And the full name of Bob Bremner's book
is Chairman of the Fed, William McChesney Martin Jr.
and the creation of the modern American financial system.
And Noelle, by the way,
I'm not joking about Fed Independence Day.
I want this to happen.
I want our audience to celebrate it.
I believe you.
Yeah, I know you do.
My concern is that other people don't think I'm serious.
And so I thought, Noelle,
we need a special greeting from the right person.
Go, go ahead.
This is Janet Yellen,
former chair of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve.
I want to wish everybody
a very happy Fed Independence Day.
Thank you for trusting the Federal Reserve and me
with the privilege and the responsibility
of conducting your monetary policy.
Beautiful.
Happy Fed Independence Day to you.
Same to you.
Take care.
Thank you.
You too, bye.
