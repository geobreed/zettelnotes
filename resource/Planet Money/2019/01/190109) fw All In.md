STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

On a hot day in the summer of 2012, Derek Wolters drives to the Rio Casino in Las Vegas.

KEITH ROMER, HOST:

He's going there to play in the most famous poker tournament in the world, the World Series of Poker Main Event.

VANEK SMITH: What do you wear to these tournaments?

DEREK WOLTERS: Personally, I just try to wear, like, comfortable clothes, yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Like a tracksuit?

WOLTERS: (Laughter) Not a tracksuit. I try to, like, look presentable - just, like, jeans, T-shirt, hoodie.

ROMER: Sunglasses or no sunglasses?

WOLTERS: I don't wear sunglasses. It would just be weird to me, wearing them inside.

ROMER: Because, in fact, it is weird to wear sunglasses inside.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We're back in Las Vegas for the 43rd edition of poker's most prestigious tournament.

ROMER: Derek, like everyone at the tournament, has to pay $10,000 to play. If he wins, first prize is 8.5 million bucks.

VANEK SMITH: Derek is a professional poker player, and he figures he's got an edge.

WOLTERS: There's always going to be some pros at your table, and there's going to be some recreational players, usually kind of, like, split half-and-half.

ROMER: When you say recreational players, is that just a nice way of saying bad players (laughter)?

WOLTERS: Yes. That's the...

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

WOLTERS: Yeah, that's the PC way - one of the PC ways of saying that.

VANEK SMITH: Derek is going to pick off these recreational players one by one and make a killing.

ROMER: That is the plan anyway, but that is not how things go down.

VANEK SMITH: On the very first day of the tournament, Derek goes all in, and he loses. He's out.

WOLTERS: It's a pretty bad feeling. You lose the last of your chips. What - you push them over to the other player, and just kind of collect your things and just, like, do the walk of shame out of the poker room to your car. The hallways are so quiet just because, like, everyone's at their seats playing.

VANEK SMITH: The $10,000 Derek used to buy into the World Series of Poker - that is gone. And Derek is completely out of the tournament.

ROMER: Except - he isn't. In fact, the 2012 Main Event is going to be the biggest payday of Derek Wolters's life.

(SOUNDBITE OF SARAH CHERNOFF SONG, "TURN THE LIGHTS ON")

ROMER: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Keith Romer.

VANEK SMITH: And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. Today on the show, the secret world of big money poker tournaments.

ROMER: What you see on TV - that is just the surface of things.

VANEK SMITH: There is a game behind the game.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TURN THE LIGHTS ON")

SARAH CHERNOFF: (Singing) Lights are on, and night is cold. Everything's so beautiful...

ROMER: Stacey?

VANEK SMITH: Yes.

ROMER: I want you to get ready for some sweet ESPN poker tape.

VANEK SMITH: All right. Bring it on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Before 6,598 players compete for poker's most important title, the tournament rooms are empty - no players, no dealers, no stories. The only thing that fills the room is hope.

ROMER: That is how you report on an empty room.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Outside that empty room, though, there are some pretty great stories happening.

ROMER: One of those stories is about that player Derek you heard at the beginning. He's renting this house about five miles south of the Las Vegas Strip with some of his poker buddies. It's a nice house. There's a pool table upstairs, swimming pool in the back.

VANEK SMITH: The youngest guy in their group is just 21. He's a skinny guy with longish hair that he wears kind of swiped across his forehead. His name is Jake Balsiger. He told us he didn't actually get his own room in this house.

JAKE BALSIGER: No, I was sleeping on the couch (laughter). It was a huge couch, though. It was pretty nice, actually.

ROMER: In terms of this group of guys that you're staying with, were you kind of the low man on the totem pole?

BALSIGER: Oh, yeah, definitely (laugher) -- unquestionably.

VANEK SMITH: Jake cannot afford to buy into this big poker tournament. It costs $10,000, and he's in college. But he's friends with a bunch of the guys, so he comes down for a visit. He figures he'll go home once the tournament starts.

BALSIGER: I had no intention of playing it. You know, it was a lot of money, and I didn't feel comfortable risking that or anything, you know. And my friend Max was having his birthday party that day. (Laughter) And I had actually literally packed up everything I brought to Vegas into my car. And I was going to leave, and then they were, like, you know, just hang out, you know, at the party, you know, for a couple hours. Like, you know, you can drive home, like, any time of the day. It's fine. Just hang out for a little bit.

VANEK SMITH: The party goes on for a while. People are drinking, and Derek and the other guys are, like, Jake, you have to do this. You just turned 21. You can actually legally play in the tournament. It's the world series - the Main Event.

BALSIGER: I don't know if it was just because they were, you know, drunk and in a good mood (laughter) or what not. But they're, like, oh, you know, man. You have to play the main. Just stay for the main. We'll buy a piece.

ROMER: The guys say, look, we will pay for it. We will pay the $10,000 so you can play.

VANEK SMITH: Who are these friends?

ROMER: I don't know. I don't have friends like that.

VANEK SMITH: Actually, they're not just giving him the money. His roommates are offering to stake him. That is the term. And what it means is that they're going to be investing in Jake. If someone chips in 10 percent of the buy-in, that guy will get 10 percent of whatever Jake, the kid sleeping on the couch, wins.

ROMER: Did he pass a hat and people just be, like, I'll but in 1,500? Like, how did that actually work?

BALSIGER: Yeah. I mean, pretty much so. I don't know who first said it, but one of them was like, yeah, you know, I'll take, like, 10 percent. And somebody else was like, yeah, I'll take 10. Somebody else was like, yeah, I'll take, you know, 10 or 15. And then it just go up to number where if I lost, I lost it. It's not too huge of a risk.

VANEK SMITH: So if Jake wins, he would get to keep some of the money. But most of it would go to his roommates - like Derek.

ROMER: Derek puts in $1,500. And now he basically owns shares in Jake, like Jake is a stock or something.

VANEK SMITH: And Jake is not his only investment. Derek actually has to make a spreadsheet to keep track of all the players he's investing money in.

WOLTERS: Let's see. A lot of these are screen names. Is that OK?

ROMER: Yeah, that's fine.

WOLTERS: OK. So AcidKnight, 5 percent; ChipChucker, 5 percent; ZacVac, 5 percent; JumanjiBoard, 5 percent; Kuvino, 5 percent; SkillsThatKillz, 5 percent; Kswell, 5 percent; 9mil, 5 percent, John K., 5 percent; ManChild, 5 percent; Jake, 15 percent.

I think that's it.

VANEK SMITH: Some of these guys, Derek is friends with. But some, he says, he wouldn't recognize even if he ran into them at the tournament. They're just poker players that he finds online.

ROMER: So you just sent 500 bucks to a dude named ChipChucker that you've never seen in your life?

WOLTERS: Yeah, probably, like, half of the deals I do, like, I never meet the person, yeah.

VANEK SMITH: So this is part of the game behind the game. Poker tournament are really expensive, and so a lot of the players you see on TV, they are not playing with their own money.

ROMER: Even really good players, most of the time they enter a tournament, they're going to lose. And even if they do win, only a few people are going to win the really big prizes. Poker tournaments are sort of a recipe for burning through a lot of money.

VANEK SMITH: Being a professional poker player is like having a job where you get paid once every 10 years. And when you do get paid, it's a lot of money. It's 10 years' worth of money, but there are a lot of lean times before that.

ROMER: That's why poker players like Derek spread their risks around a little. Instead of just making one giant bet on themselves, they make all these other little bets too. Of course, buying shares in other players can get expensive, so there's another thing poker players do. They trade shares of themselves with other players.

VANEK SMITH: Before the tournament begins, Derek does this too. It's a simple system. He finds a guy he wants to trade with, and they make a deal.

WOLTERS: I'll give him 5 percent of whatever I win, and he'll give me 5 percent of whatever he wins.

ROMER: For this tournament, Derek made five swaps.

WOLTERS: I swapped with my friends Chardin, Max, Jake, Ajay and Misha. They were all 5 percent.

VANEK SMITH: These are all handshake deals, by the way - no contracts.

WOLTERS: Normally, you'll plan it, like, a day in advance. You'll just, like, message your friends and, like, make sure you guys are on the same page with the swaps. But sometimes, you'll just see, like, a friend you haven't seen in a while in the hallway, and you're going to be, like, oh, yeah, hey, let's swap a little bit.

ROMER: You'll just send a text message and say - hey, if you win $8 million, I'll get 5 percent of it, right? You're cool with that? I'm cool with that. Like, that's it?

WOLTERS: Yep, that's it (laughter),

ROMER: Derek says you only really want to swap percentages with someone who's as good as you are.

VANEK SMITH: Has someone ever asked you to swap, and you were, like, no, I'm sorry. I think you're not-so-good.

WOLTERS: One move is, like, someone asks you to swap, you don't really want to. You're like yeah, I'll, like, swap 1 percent with you (laughter). There's a lot of ways you could deal with the situation. Like, you can just say, oh, sorry, I'm swapped out. I've already swapped with so many people, you know, and it's not a big deal.

ROMER: Derek is not the only one doing all this swapping and buying and selling, by the way. He estimates that something like half of the players in this tournament have sold a percentage of themselves.

VANEK SMITH: And even more than that are swapping pieces of themselves.

WOLTERS: I would say basically every professional is swapping.

VANEK SMITH: And this can lead to some awkward situations.

ROMER: Like, what if Derek and ChipChucker end up sitting next to each other? Why would Derek try to knock ChipChucker out? That hurts him. That's his investment. Does it ever happen that you end up at the same table with somebody you've swapped shares with or you own shares of?

WOLTERS: Yeah. That happens all the time. And yeah, as long as you have, like, a small percentage of them, it's not really a big deal.

ROMER: But I mean - something like, in the business world or in the professional world - or in the world, we would call this a conflict of interest.

WOLTERS: Mm-hm.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

WOLTERS: Yeah, it is definitely a conflict of interest. And you don't want to - you don't want to cheat the other players basically.

ROMER: I asked a lot of poker players about this. And they basically all said yeah, this could be a problem. But at this point, the shares players have in each other - they tend to be pretty small. And there's just not a way to help out the other guy without hurting your own chances. Either they get my chips, or I get my chips. You can't have it both ways.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: This is a tournament for everyone, and everyone is here - pros, amateurs, dreamers.

ROMER: This is the scene when the tournament starts. There are three giant rooms in the Rio Casino, poker tables as far as you can see. There are 6,000 people playing in this tournament. You can hear the sound of the chips in the room.

VANEK SMITH: Derek, as we mentioned, got knocked out of the tournament on his first day. But because of the game behind the game, he is not out. Between all of those swaps and shares, he has a piece of 15 players who are still in the tournament. It is like this little army of Dereks out there, all trying to win him money.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: All right, so a 13.5 million-chip pot. They see the trey of spades on the river.

ROMER: The tournament keeps going - day one, day two, day three. Derek's army of players gets knocked out, one after the other. By the middle of day four, Derek's only has four players left.

VANEK SMITH: Then ChipChucker goes down, then ManChild.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: One hundred forty-one pros and amateurs continue on day five.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROMER: Then Kswell gets knocked out.

VANEK SMITH: Derek has only one chance left in this tournament, one player he is now pinning all of his hopes on - Jake.

ROMER: Jake, the 21-year-old kid sleeping on the couch - the one whose friends chipped in so he could play the tournament.

BALSIGER: Day one went decent. Day two went pretty well. And then from day three and on, I was just, like, running very, very good.

ROMER: Over the course of that week, did the guys from the house start treating you any differently?

BALSIGER: Yeah, I - they let me move into the master bedroom from the couch.

ROMER: Oh.

(LAUGHTER)

BALSIGER: So that was pretty cool, you know, definitely moved up in the world (laughter).

ROMER: The guys who've paid for Jake to play, they decide they need to take better care of their investment. So he gets the master bedroom and whatever else he wants. Derek says if Jake wanted something to drink at the poker table - he liked fancy juices - one of the guys would bring it to him.

WOLTERS: I know, definitely, one of his requests at the time was Naked Juice. We did a lot of that.

(LAUGHTER)

VANEK SMITH: What kind - like, the green kind?

WOLTERS: One of the fruits kinds. Yeah, I'm not sure.

ROMER: And Jake just keeps winning and hanging around.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Now back to Balsiger - running deep in this 21-year-old's first ever Main Event. He makes it 2 million straight.

ROMER: And hanging around...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: All right. Action on Jake Balsiger, the 21-year-old coming off his junior year at Arizona State with a raise to a half-million with a...

ROMER: ...And hanging around.

VANEK SMITH: And when those 6,598 players finally get winnowed down to nine players - to the final table of the tournament - you know who still wasn't knocked out?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Balsiger gets new life.

(CHEERING)

ROMER: Getting to be one of the nine players at the final table is a big deal. Poker players try their whole lives to get there, and Jake makes it the first year he's even legally allowed inside the casino.

BALSIGER: Oh, I mean, it's just the literal best feeling there is, you know. Like, during that entire time, you know, you're just on, like, complete cloud nine.

ROMER: The final table is played in this theater with 1,000 or 2,000 seats. Jake is wearing the same blue plaid shirt he wore for every day of the tournament.

BALSIGER: It's really a cool environment. It's very high-energy. You know, people are, like, cheering. People are just getting very, like, drunk during it. And you know, it's kind of just like a crazy sports game almost.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Wow, gutsy, gutsy call.

ROMER: At that table, Jake looks really, really young, like they let this skinny teenager in off the street or something. Behind him, his whole crew is wearing the same blue plaid shirts that Jake is wearing.

VANEK SMITH: Derek is there, of course, right in the front row on the rail.

WOLTERS: When you're on the rail, and you have a piece of someone, it's like you. Personally, I get a lot more nervous than when I'm playing. I'm just, like, sitting there, and I have no control.

ROMER: So it's like you're gambling.

WOLTERS: Yeah, exactly. And I mean, like, when your guy, like, gets all in, and you're just, like, watching on the sidelines - yeah, it's really intense.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The clock about to strike midnight on Jake Balsiger's fairytale.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: All right, now, the turn card...

(CROWD SCREAMING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: ...Is a 10.

(CHEERING)

VANEK SMITH: That cheering - you can probably hear Derek in there.

ROMER: After hours and hours of play, the nine players get whittled down to four.

VANEK SMITH: And Jake - skinny little Jake is still there, holding his own.

ROMER: Jake gets all in against another player, Russell Thomas.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Ace, king for Balsiger. Ace, nine off for Thomas. And this could be the end of our evening.

ROMER: Jake wins the hand and takes Russell out of the tournament.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: And it is a seven of hearts, and that won't do it for Russell Thomas. Knocked out of the Main Event by Jake Balsiger who gets a lot stronger.

UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake...

VANEK SMITH: In the end, that's as far as our player Jake and our investor Derek get.

ROMER: Many, many, many hours later, Jake gets knocked out himself. He takes third. But you know what you get with third place? A lot of money.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Balsiger out - in third place, winning almost $4 million.

ROMER: What they are not telling you on TV is that Jake is not taking home $4 million. He's takes home a little under $700,000. The rest of it is going to his buddies who invested in him.

VANEK SMITH: After the tournament ends, Jake wires his friends their share. For Derek, Jake writes a personal check for $600,000 on a Hello Kitty check.

BALSIGER: Yeah. I had a Hello Kitty checkbook (laughter), which I loved. I thought it was funny (laughter).

ROMER: With his share of the money, Jake goes big.

BALSIGER: The only two, like, possessions I remember buying were a bed frame from IKEA because I'd been sleeping just, like, on the mattress on the floor and then I bought a hammock on Amazon for, like, I want to say $120.

VANEK SMITH: Derek, our investor, who watched the whole tournament from the sidelines - he took home almost as much as Jake, $600,000.

ROMER: Derek took that money and reinvested it.

VANEK SMITH: Derek still plays tournaments. But more and more, this is what he's doing - buying up shares in other players.

ROMER: Are you a better investor or a better poker player?

WOLTERS: Definitely better investor, I think. There's a lot of really good poker players. But there's not that many people who do as much investing as me.

ROMER: Derek knows a lot about poker. He knows the math. He knows that if you need an ace or a 10 to come on the last card, you have a 17.4 percent chance. Knowing the odds is his job. And for him, the odds are best when he is betting on other people instead of playing himself.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TURN THE LIGHTS ON")

CHERNOFF: (Singing) The (unintelligible) your name I can almost feel it all again.

ROMER: By the way, I reached out to three of the other finalists. They all sold pieces big shares of themselves. Two of the guys even swapped 3 percent with each other. Special thanks today to Jesse Sylvia, Shaun Deeb, Carol Kline, Mike McDonald Ryan LaPlante and Jen Newell.

That is how you report on an empty room
Outside that empty room though. There are some pretty great stories happening
One of those stories is about that player Derek you heard at the beginning
He's renting this house about five miles south of the Las Vegas strip with some of his poker buddies. It's a nice house
There's a pool table upstairs swimming pool in the back. The youngest guy in their group is just 21

No, I was sleeping on the couch
It was a huge couch that was pretty nice actually
In terms of this group of guys that you're staying with were you kind of the low man on the totem pole? Oh, yeah, definitely
Unquestionably Jake cannot afford to buy into this big poker tournament. It costs
$10,000 and he's in college, but he's friends with a bunch of the guys so he comes down for a visit
He figures he'll go home once the tournament starts. I had no intention of playing it
you know, it was a lot of money and I
Didn't feel comfortable risking that or anything, you know
You know, my friend Max was having his birthday party that day and I had actually literally packed up
Everything I brought to Vegas into my car and I was gonna leave and then they're like, you know
Just just hang out the you know the party for you know
A couple hours like, you know, you can drive home like any time today. It's fine
It's just hang out for a little bit
The party goes on for a while people are drinking and Derek and the other guys are like Jake
You got to do this. You just turned 21. You can actually legally play in the tournament
It's the World Series the main event
I don't know just because they were you know, drunken in a good mood or whatnot, but they're like, oh, you know man
You got to play the main just just stay for the main. Well, we'll buy a piece the guys say look
We will pay for it. We will pay the $10,000 so you can play who are these friends?
I don't know. I don't have friends like that
Actually, they're not just giving him the money his roommates are offering to stake him
That is the term and what it means is that they're going to be investing in Jake if someone chips in 10%
Of the buy-in that guy will get 10% of whatever Jake
The kids sleeping on the couch wins
Did you pass a hat and people just be like I'll put in 1,500 bucks. Like how did that actually work?
Yeah, I mean pretty much so so I don't know who first said it
But one of them was like, yeah, you know, I'll take like 10% and somebody else is like, yeah
I'll take 10 somebody else like I'll take you know
10 or 15 and then it just go up to a number where if I lost that I lost it
It's not too too huge of a risk
So if Jake wins he would get to keep some of the money
But most of it would go to his roommates like Derek Derek puts in
$1,500 and now he basically owns shares in Jake like Jake is a stock or something and Jake is not his only investment
Derek actually has to make a spreadsheet to keep track of all the players. He's investing money in
Let's see. A lot of these are screen names. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so
acid night five percent
chip-chucker five percent
Zakvac five percent Jumanji board five percent Covino five percent
skills dick kills five percent
Casewell five percent nine mil five percent John K five percent man child five percent
Jake fifteen percent
I think that's I think that's it
Some of these guys Derek is friends with but some he says he wouldn't recognize even if he ran into them at the tournament
They're just poker players that he finds online
So you just sent five hundred bucks to a dude named chip-chucker that you've never seen in your life
Yeah, probably like half of the deals I do like I never meet the person
Yeah
So this is part of the game behind the game poker tournaments are really expensive and so a lot of the players you see
On TV, they are not playing with their own money even really good players. Most of the time they enter a tournament
They're going to lose and even if they do win only a few people are gonna win the really big prizes

I'll give him five percent of whatever I win and he'll give me five percent of whatever he wins for this tournament
Derek made five swaps. I swapped with my friends chardin
Max jake aje and misha they were all five percent. These are all handshake deals, by the way, no contracts
Normally you'll you'll plan it like a day in advance
You'll just like message your friends and like make sure you guys are on the same page with the swaps
But sometimes you'll just see like a friend you haven't seen in a while in the hallway and you're like, oh, yeah
Hey, let's swap a little bit. You'll just send a text message and say hey if you win eight million dollars
I'll get five percent of it right? You're cool with that. I'm cool with that like that's it
Yep, that's it
Derek says you only really want to swap percentages with someone who's as good as you are
Has someone ever asked you to swap and you're like, I don't know. I'm sorry. I think you're not so good
One move is like someone asks you to swap. You don't really want to you're like, yeah, i'll like swap one percent with you
There's a lot of ways you could deal with the situation like you can just say oh, sorry
I'm swapped out. I've already swapped with so many people, you know, and it's not a big deal
Derek is not the only one doing all this swapping and buying and selling by the way
He estimates that something like half of the players in this tournament have sold a percentage of themselves and even more than that
Are swapping pieces of themselves? I would say basically every professional is swapping
And this can lead to some awkward situations
Like what if Derek and chip chucker end up sitting next to each other?
Why would Derek try to knock chip chucker out that hurts him?
That's his investment does it ever happen that you end up at it at the same table with somebody you've swapped shares with
Or you you own shares of?
uh, yeah, that happens all the time
And yeah, as long as you have like a small percentage of them, it's not really a big deal
but I mean so like in the business world or in the professional world or
in the world
We would call this a conflict of interest
Yeah, it is definitely a conflict of interest and
You don't want to you don't want to cheat the other players basically
I asked a lot of poker players about this and they basically all said
Yeah, this could be a problem. But at this point the shares players have in each other
They tend to be pretty small and there's just not a way to help out the other guy without hurting your own chances
Either they get my chips or I get my chips. You can't have it both ways
This is a tournament for everyone and everyone is here pros
amateurs dreamers
This is the scene when the tournament starts
There are three giant rooms in the rio casino poker tables as far as you can see
There are six thousand people playing in this tournament. You can hear the
Sound of the chips in the room derrick as we mentioned got knocked out of the tournament on his first day
But because of the game behind the game he is not out between all of those swaps and shares
He's got a piece of 15 players who are still in the tournament
It is like this little army of derricks out there all trying to win him money. All right, so
A thirteen and a half million chip pot
They see the tray of spades on the river. Okay, the tournament keeps going day one day two day three
Derrick's army of players gets knocked out one after the other by the middle of day four derrick's only got four players left
Then chip chucker goes down
then manchild
141 pros and amateurs continue on day five
Five
Then case well gets knocked out derrick has only got one chance left in this tournament one player
He is now pinning all of his hopes on
jake
Jake the 21 year old kid sleeping on the couch the one whose friends chipped in so he could play the tournament
Day one went decent day two went pretty well and then from day three and on I was just like running very very good
Over the course of that week, uh, did the guys from the house start treating you any differently?
Yeah, I they let me move into the master bedroom from the couch
That was pretty cool, you know definitely moved up in the world
The guys who paid for jake to play they decide they need to take better care of their investment
So he gets the master bedroom and whatever else he wants derrick says if jake wanted something to drink at the poker table
He liked fancy juices one of the guys would bring it to him
I know definitely one of his requests at the time was naked juice. We did a lot of that
What kind like the green kind one of the fruit kinds. Yeah, i'm, not sure and jake just keeps winning and hanging around
now back to balciger
Running deep in this 21 year old's first ever main event
He makes it two million straight and hanging around action on jake balciger the 21 year old coming off his junior year
At arizona state with a raise to a half million with a and hanging around and when those
6598 players finally get winnowed down to nine players to the final table of the tournament
You know who still wasn't knocked out
Getting to be one of the nine players at the final table is a big deal
Poker players try their whole lives to get there and jake makes it the first year
He's even legally allowed inside the casino. I mean, it's just
The literal best feeling there is you know, like during that entire time, you know
You're just on like complete cloud nine the final table is played in this theater with a thousand or two thousand seats
Jake is wearing the same blue plaid shirt. He wore for every day of the tournament
It's a really cool environment very high energy
You know people are like cheering people are just getting very like drunk during it
You know, it's kind of just like like a crazy sports game almost
Wow
At that table jake looks really really young like they let this skinny teenager in off the street or something
Behind him his whole crew is wearing the same blue plaid shirts that jake is wearing derek
Is there of course right in the front row on the rail when you're on the rail and you have a piece of someone it's
Like you
Personally, I get a lot more nervous than when i'm playing i'm just like sitting there and I have no control
So it's like you're gambling
Uh, yeah, exactly. And I mean like when your guy like gets all in and you're just like watching on the sidelines. Yeah, it's uh,
Yeah, it's really intense the clock about to strike midnight on jake balsiger's fairy tale
All right now the turn card
Is a 10
That cheering you can probably hear derek in there after hours and hours of play
The nine players get whittled down to four and jake skinny little jake is still there holding his own
Jake gets all in against another player russell thomas
Ace king for balsiger ace nine off for thomas and this could be the end of our evening
Jake wins the hand and takes russell out of the tournament and it is a seven of hearts and that won't do it for russell thomas
Knocked out of the mane of it by jake balsiger who gets a lot stronger
Oh
In the end that's as far as our player jake and our investor derek get many many many hours later
Jake gets knocked out himself. He takes third, but you know what you get with third place
a lot of money
What they are not telling you on tv is that jake is not taking home four million dollars
He's taking home a little under seven hundred thousand the rest of it is going to his buddies who invested in him
After the tournament ends jake wires his friends their share for derek jake writes a personal check for six hundred thousand dollars
On a hello kitty check. Yeah, I had a hello kitty checkbook
Which I loved
I thought it was funny
with his share of the money jake goes big the only two like
Possessions I remember buying were a bed frame from ikea because i'd been sleeping just like on the mattress on the floor
And then I bought a hammock on amazon for like I want to say 120 dollars
Derek our investor who watched the whole tournament from the sidelines. He took home almost as much as jake
$600,000 derek took that money and reinvested it derek still plays tournaments
But more and more this is what he's doing buying up shares in other players
Are you a better investor or a better poker player?
I'm definitely better investor. I think there's a lot of really good poker players
But there's not that many people who do as much investing as me
Derek knows a lot about poker. He knows the math
He knows that if you need an ace or a 10 to come on the last card
You've got a 17.4 chance knowing the odds is his job and for him
The odds are best when he is betting on other people instead of playing himself

Hey, it's keith here in 2019
It's now been six and a half years since jake won all that money at the world series of poker
And it turned out it was not beginner's luck jake has gone on to become a professional poker player
He does not need his friends to buy him into tournaments anymore
Now he is one of the pros that folks like derek are super eager to swap with
And derek still investing so I called him up on skype to find out what's changed
Hey keith, how's it going? Good. How are you doing, man?
Derek reports he is still making good money as a poker investor
But now that he's got more money to invest he started running into a problem last year
It was to the point where I couldn't put in as much as I even wanted to I could see a player who's
Really great in an amazing tournament, but he only has like 20% available for sale derek is learning
Poker investing is hard to scale up optimal strategy for me would to be like, okay
I want to put 5 000 into that which that's something that you could do with like
stocks or
Real estate maybe but not poker
Don't feel too bad for derek though. He's still a poker player and a really good one last february
He made the final table of this big tournament in los angeles. It was a million dollars up top and
Ended up getting third place in the end for about
430 000
His buddy jake decided not to play that tournament. So the five percent swap they normally would have done
Didn't happen that seems like that was a mistake on his part
It's very unlucky for jake
I did offer to help derek with his investing problem
After all i've been having all of the success at the lowest possible limits in atlantic city
I have been crushing the one two game at the borgata
Is this the year that you're going to stake me for the main event?
Okay, the one i've never been to borgata. So that could be outside of my scope
But that that's a great start though
I
Feel like all you've done is update your your way of refusing people who you shouldn't stake
That's outside my scope. That's nice
Like any good investor derek still knows a bad deal when he sees one
So instead of finding worse and worse poker players to invest in with all his extra money. He's diversified
He's shifting some of his focus to startups
