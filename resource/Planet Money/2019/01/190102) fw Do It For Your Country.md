People are the engine that fuels an economy. But what happens when you start running out of people?

People aren't just good for the economy. They are the economy. So when a place needs people, it'll do almost anything to attract them.

**faster whisper:**
Dear young listeners when two people really love each other Sarah
Just tell them that we're gonna talk about sex in this episode. We're talking about sex in this episode. All right, you're warned a
Couple years ago Eva Lundgren woke up in Denmark to news of a weird problem. There was some
smaller articles in very serious newspapers that
told the story about the problem with not
Having enough children born in Denmark. Yes, the Great Danes were not having enough babies to replace the existing population
And this mattered to Eva because she works at a travel agency and she thinks uh-oh
We're not gonna have enough customers in the future. So they're like, okay
We need to figure out who our customers are now. Where are they going? What do they do?
How do we get them to keep traveling?
And what we found out was that people going on city breaks were mainly couples city breaks
You mean vacation?
Yeah, sort of like small vacations two or three nights to a big city people in Denmark get five weeks of vacation every year
Of course they I know so unfair. So apparently when Danish couples go on these short city breaks
They aren't going out to see the sights of Rome and Paris. They're just unwinding staying in their hotel rooms
And that's why we did the kind of the assumption that going abroad might
Turn into more sex and more sex might have the ability to turn into children
Right, that is how you make more children. Exactly
Eva realizes there might be an opportunity here to create future customers and sure to help out Denmark
So she launches an ad campaign the ad that we came up with which called do it for Denmark
Do it for Denmark like do it it do it it yes
They take one
Do it for Denmark their ads basically say it is your civic duty for the sake of your country
Do it and use our planes to do it in a different country. Okay, so these these ads
They are not subtle ads like they are very
Suggestive yes, it is it is
These ads are like meet Emma here
Yeah, she was born and raised in Denmark
But she was made by her parents in this hotel room in Paris
So it's quite obvious what we are what we are suggesting should happen on that
On that city break the travel agency even ran contests that were like hey prove
You gave birth to a baby around nine months after your vacation
And we will give you three years worth of baby supplies and a child-friendly vacation
And if you were ovulating they gave you a discount based on the input from people's
Period cycle we found the the period that they were
Ovulating and then we suggested different city trips in especially that period wait
So women were going to your travel agency and telling you when their next periods were
Yes, they did so that they could get a period discount exactly
This is like probably the only time in the world that women get rewarded for having their periods
Yeah, I think we should do that more, right?
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Kenny Malone and I'm Sarah Gonzalez today on the show
Do it for your country people aren't just good for the economy
They are the economy and when a police needs people they will try anything
We have a story of a plan to resurrect an Italian ghost town a battle to save a US Congress seat
By buying some residents and a state that's looking for some young blood. I'm Linda Holmes
There's more stuff to watch these days than you can ever get to that's why we make pop culture happy hour twice a week
We give you the lowdown on what's worth your time and what's not find pop culture happy hour on the NPR one app
Or wherever you get your podcasts
So Sarah, I feel like I should admit that when I heard that places were paying for population
I definitely thought that they would be these pathetic little places like it seems like kids having to pay for their own friends at
Like the lunch cafeteria, but I feel like this next example sort of puts that to rest
I actually think this is like one of the best ways you can lure people to a state
Yeah, so Sarah and I called up a guy named Nate wilds
He's one of the people in charge of promoting this particular pay for population scheme. Hello
Hey, it's not like I'm on a podcast or something that's weird Nate
I just want to say I just visited Maine
I visited Maine recently also actually you have amazing national parks awesome lobster lighthouses
You've got like wild blueberries galore and you're telling us that like you have to pay people to come and live there
Well, that's one of a few things we're trying Nate told us yeah, Maine is a super popular vacation destination
They even write
vacation land on their license plate
However vacation land is not the same as population land Maine gets about 36 million visitors a year
They have a population of just 1 million people and those 1 million people so our population is old and white
Generally speaking Maine has the oldest population in the country
The median age is just shy of 44 years old there
And what that means is that Maine needs people to come and take care of its aging population
Nate says there's a huge need for everything from physicians to administrators to IT people who can work at the hospitals
And so about ten years ago Maine decided to basically pay off people's student loans
Maine told students in the state if you stay and go to college in Maine and then stick around after you graduate
We're gonna give you a huge break on your state income tax to offset your student loans
So if you pay for example
$2,000 in student loans you got
$2,000 knocked off your state income tax bill and if you're from a STEM field science technology engineering and math
There were even more generous benefits and the employer community spoke up loud and clear and said that's great
But even if we retain a hundred percent of every college graduate in Maine that doesn't solve our talent needs. Whoa
That means you are quite low on young people. Yes, so Maine said okay
Let's broaden the program now
We don't care which state you're from and you can go to college anywhere in the country as long as you come to Maine
Afterwards and work here will cut you the same deal
The state will help with your student loan payments by dropping your state income taxes
Although as Sarah and I learned there are some restrictions to this so I graduated from college in California
So I could move to Maine and you would offset my student loans
If I move to Maine if you graduated in the year 2016 2017 2018 or any year into the future
Oh, I see you only want like actual young people. Oh
Inter host burn
We're about the same age and we don't feel old but like well, you're not too old to live and work in Maine
You definitely qualify for the quality of life. We have to offer. How about that?
That is not a cop. Come on man qualify for the quality of life. Where else in the world?
Can you wake up in the morning walk on the beach before you go to work go for a hike at your lunch break and
Be on the ski slopes by 3 p.m. Mmm, California
That's baloney the traffic in California you'd barely get to the beach by noon if you left before you woke up
Oh good point. Okay, fine. Whatever the main doesn't want 30-somethings like us there. I don't want to be in Maine
Anyway, these lighthouses. Yeah, we have cell phone flashlights
They actually don't need us though
Maine has effectively paid off more than 50 million dollars worth of student loans through this program and Nate says it's hard to know which
Of these graduates came to Maine because of the program, but as of last year around
9,000 actually young people were working in Maine taking advantage of this program
What young people mean is decades of work. Oftentimes, they're gonna start a family
They're gonna contribute a few more human beings to Maine's population and Maine's approach is actually pretty smart
They don't have a cap on how many people can participate in this program
But you only get your student loans offset if you can find a job in Maine and that's like this
Naturally built-in restriction for the program and Nate says that is good because honestly the state couldn't handle a massive
Influx of new residents. We don't have the housing stock. We don't have the schools. We don't have the jobs
So we're not looking for a huge number of people
We're looking for the right people and more of them to choose a life here in Maine
Just you know, not old 30 year old people. Although we do have so much more world experience
I know right we wouldn't skateboard down their streets. We wouldn't wear what are what are annoying things kids do
They still do in the the vaping
At least all right, thanks Kenny
We send a nick for me he's younger than us
Nick you went to a state that is sort of facing an existential crisis Rhode Island. I went there to meet Carlos Tobon
We ended up driving around in his truck. Maybe we could take a little ride and I'll show you some of the cool things
That we have Carlos is the number one booster of Rhode Island. He's a state rep
He represents about 15,000 people and it seems like he knows every single one of them
He points them out while we drive by their houses. This guy used to have a business
This guy he's he works at a lumber yard. This is a teacher
There's a Puerto Rican family
You clearly been knocking doors in this neighborhood
Absolutely, it took a lot of campaigning for Carlos to get elected the first time
Yeah, I ran three times before I got elected I lost three times and in 2012 I made history just
Not the one that I wanted. I lost by one vote. Oh
So that's why for me when people talk about counting I take it so seriously
Sarah
Carlos is a man obsessed with counting
Okay, his obsession goes back decades when he was a teenager. He had the job of a numerator numerator
Yeah, I learned that's just a fancy way of saying he counted the people of Rhode Island for the US Census Bureau
So I you know knock on a door and say hello. My name is Carlos
I'm with the Census Bureau and we see that
We haven't received your paperwork
Carlos wants to make sure that everyone in the state was counted because more people means more government resources people would say well
Why do I have to do it? And then I would explain to them. Well, this is going to affect
What Rhode Island will get for the next ten years and everything from infrastructure money and schools
to the representation we have in Washington
representation in Washington
Rhode Island right now has two congressional reps, but they're at risk of losing one of them
Our state is facing grave danger
Okay, there are
435 congressional seats in the country and every census we divvy up those seats based on which states are growing
In which states are shrinking and in order for Rhode Island to not lose one of their seats
The state needs to grow by
30,000 people and Carlos really doesn't want to lose that seat
So he proposed a bill that would give ten thousand dollars in tax credits to ten thousand families
Families of three or more if they reside in Rhode Island long enough to be counted in the next census
So they can like get their ten thousand dollars and then move away
They could but Carlos is hoping they won't and I should say that is just one of several
Criticisms of his plan Democrats say subsidizing the rich because he only wants to give tax credits to families who make above a certain
Threshold and Republicans are like this is just a waste of money because if you do the math
Carlos's bill will cost a hundred million dollars hundred million dollars. That does not seem worth
One extra congressional seat to me. I don't know for Carlos
It is totally worth it the way he sees it Rhode Island gets billions of dollars from the federal government every year
But there's also a lot of federal spending that can be willed in one direction or another like for example
orders of
Submarines that get built in Rhode Island. He wants that extra vote to influence spending like that
We can't stand to take another loss if we lose a seat
We'll be scratching our heads and we could talk about all the things we could have done, but it's too late
For ten years, right? No, probably forever
Remember Carlos lost an election by one vote
I think he just doesn't want to live that nightmare again of just missing out. I can understand that
Thanks, Nick. Gotta go gonna see if I can score one of those tax credits
Okay, but I need a co-host to send someone else in how much is it worth to you?
Okay, we just heard about two really expensive ways to increase your population
Coming up after the break a deal so good. It's free
Hey, this is Guy Raz and on the next TED radio hour stories of remarkable
Transformations in the face of extraordinary circumstances. I often forget that my limbs are synthetic
That's how well they work. You can find the TED radio hour wherever you listen to podcasts
Okay, so while some countries are putting out sexy commercials saying have more babies
please and
US states are literally paying people money to move to their towns one mayor in a small town in Italy thought
Why not just welcome refugees?
there are more than 28 million refugees and asylum seekers in the world according to the United Nations and
Immigration is one way that a lot of countries have solved their population problems for decades
Countries like Denmark Italy they develop and modernize they get richer and their birth rates drop
So we all start to depend a little bit more on immigrants
But in this Italian town that familiar story went sideways and to tell us all about it is the one and only
Sylvia Pagoli NPR senior European correspondent Sylvia. Welcome to Planet Money. Thank you. Thank you for having me
Okay, so tell us about
Riachi, oh
It's um, it's a medieval town perched on a hill in Calabria
It's that's sort of the toe of the Italian boot and it was until about 20 years ago
Almost abandoned ghost town with not more than a couple thousand people living there
But then something happened in the summer of 1998
Hundreds of refugees arrived at Riachi's shores. That's right
And the mayor Domenico Lucano had this idea of why don't we welcome them and he basically offered them a place to live in the many
Empty apartments that existed in the town and he offered them places to start opening little artisan shops
There were hardly any businesses now. It's full of cafes and shops
I'm not gonna say it's a thriving town, but it's a living town
It's been called the Riachi experiment and several other towns in Italy were inspired not many but a few started doing it
and
Lucano was he's become quite famous for having done this now
But then the current refugee crisis that we all know about happened and that changed things
Not just the refugee crisis, but the arrival of a new government
which is very much anti-migrant and they crack down against all these welcoming attitude towards migrants and
Domenico Lucano was charged with
basically, he was accused of
Enabling and encouraging illegal migration they were upset that he was giving
Refugees jobs. Yeah, exactly. They had to find some excuse in any case
He was first put under house arrest and now he has been banned from living in Riachi
So he is the current mayor of Riachi, but he is not allowed to be in Riachi. That's right
How does he feel about that he's pretty furious
Yeah, so Sylvia there are all these cities and states and countries that are like actually begging for people to move there
Meanwhile, there's this global refugee crisis and it seems like a match made in heaven, but it's not really happening
Well, definitely in most of Europe now
There is a overwhelming anti-migrant feeling all the policies now are making it much harder for migrants
To settle and to make a decent living in these countries
The problem is the migrants aren't gonna stop coming. They're gonna always find a way also these town Italy
Also has one of the lowest birth rates in the world
So it needs migrants if it wants to you know
Sort of make its economy work in the future or people could just make more babies. They could
But doesn't look like people are very willing to do that right now
All right, Sylvia and just because you are legendary and because my two co-hosts
Totally ditched me. Will you stick around and do the credits with us? Sure
If you have a story idea send us an email planet money at NPR or
Today's show was produced by Darien woods

I'm Sarah Gonzalez and I'm Sylvia po drolly. Thanks for listening
And one more thing we couldn't fit into the show was how Singapore tried to increase its birth rate through
Song it's time to do our civic duty and I'm not talking about speeches fireworks or parades, but I like that stuff
I'm talking about the stuff after that stuff. I'm talking about making a baby, baby. You ready?
Let go
First population it needs some creasing. Uh-huh get waving flags August 9th. We be freaking. Yeah
I want to cram real hard
