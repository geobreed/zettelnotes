For decades, most websites ended in either .com, .net, or .org. But a few years ago, everything changed.

Note: This episode originally aired in April, 2014.

There are over 120 million websites ending in .com. But a few years ago, a bunch of new domains came online. So instead of .com, .gov or .net, not there's also .ninja, .bike and .cool, too. In all, over a 1000 new top-level domains, as they're called, were added to the list of possible website endings.

Today on the show, what happens when you just create a whole bunch of internet real estate out of nowhere? We meet some of the new land barons with big dreams. And some who wish things would just stay the same.

For more, check out these websites:

    Here's a list of new top-level domains that currently exist.
    Here's a list of top-level domains that have been applied for.
    Namestat and nTLDStats are websites that track how well each one is doing — how many sites have registered with each domain.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Hey, it's Jacob Goldstein. Today's show is a rerun. It was first reported by Caitlin Kenney and David Kestenbaum back in 2014. Here it is.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

When you go to a website and you type in whatever - Amazon.com, Facebook.com, joespizza.com (ph) - did you ever wonder how we ended up with dot-com as the ending? It turns out you have to go back to the earliest days of the internet. I tracked down one of the founders.

Is it right you were present when the internet was created?

STEVE CROCKER: Yeah, but let me be - try to be careful about this.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

This is Steve Crocker. It turns out, like all things internet, the creation of the internet itself was a collaboration. Crocker was a grad student in the 1960s, and back in those days, every computer was separate. But there was this idea - what if you could string wires between each one and work out some way for them to communicate? Then they could send stuff back and forth. The project that Crocker worked on was called the ARPANET. They managed to hook up four computers at different universities. If you were sitting at one and you wanted to communicate with another, it was really very bare bones. You didn't type a name for that computer. You had to just use a number.

CROCKER: UCLA was one. SRI was two. UCSB, Santa Barbara, was three and Utah was four. And I'm being absolutely literal.

KESTENBAUM: You'd say, like, connect to number one, connect to number two.

CROCKER: Exactly so.

KESTENBAUM: Things quickly got more complicated. More and more computers got added to the network.

CROCKER: Previous attempts had been to connect two or three computers together, and by those standards, this was enormous.

KESTENBAUM: How many computers?

CROCKER: Well, it started out with four and quickly grew to 15 and then grew to 50.

KESTENBAUM: It is, of course, a pain to have to remember those numbers. So someone writes a few lines of computer code, and now you don't have to remember MIT is six or whatever. You just type M-I-T.

So even computer people prefer to have letters than numbers (laughter).

CROCKER: Well, yes (laughter). Computer people really are just like everybody else. They're people.

KESTENBAUM: This, it turns out, was only a temporary fix. The number of computers connected grew to the hundreds and more. Someone needed to take charge to build the new naming system to bring order to the growing chaos, and this historic task was given to Paul Mockapetris, who - well, he just got his Ph.D.

PAUL MOCKAPETRIS: You know, the only reason I got the job was nobody thought it was important. And so we have a new Ph.D. Let's give him the - this job.

KESTENBAUM: Paul says there was this big debate going on. Some people wanted this internet thing organized by country. Other people said, come on. Let's be more international about it. Let's group things by type. And so the idea of ending web addresses with a dot and then a few letters was born. But remember, at the time, the internet was much smaller, and it was just seen as this thing for governments and universities. Again, Steve Crocker.

CROCKER: You had dot-mil for the military portion of the U.S. government, dot-gov for the civilian side, dot-edu for universities, and then for those few commercial companies that happened to be part of it, a little catchall called dot-com.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

CROCKER: Of course now it's a major property.

KESTENBAUM: Dot-com was born. C-O-M was for commercial companies. I asked Paul Mockapetris who actually came up with it.

MOCKAPETRIS: You know, I've had about three sets of people ask me to testify to the fact that they did it.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

MOCKAPETRIS: And I dont really know.

KESTENBAUM: Caitlin, you know, I was expecting someone to say, yeah, I just wrote it down on a napkin, but it seems like we just don't know the answer.

CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST:

Yeah. It's funny to me, though, because I actually never thought that it stood for anything. I've just been so used to typing dot-com my whole life I've actually never thought about what dot-com stands for.

KESTENBAUM: You just type those four characters.

KENNEY: Yeah, I just kind of thought it was random, and it was assigned for a reason. And the thing that's crazy about it is that this little quirk, it ended up having really big consequences for the internet because think about it. Everybody wants the good names, the dot-com names. Like, imagine you have a business, and it's called Joe's Pizza. So the first person who gets on the internet gets joespizza.com. That's it. They're good. They have a nice, clean website name. But then all the other Joe's Pizzas out there all across the U.S., they have to add words and letters. They have to become bigjoespizza.com (ph), joespizzaon7th.com (ph), happyjoes.com (ph), tomatojoespizza.com (ph).

KESTENBAUM: You left out joespizzaofthevillage.com (ph).

KENNEY: (Laughter) Right because that one's easy to remember.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) So for the people who were not first who were not lucky, some of them have had to pay big money to the people who got those simple website names. First, Toys R Us, for instance, bought toys.com for $5 million. Sex.com sold for $13 million.

KENNEY: This is the reason - you know the photo-sharing website Flickr? It's actually spelled F-L-I-C-K-R - no E.

KESTENBAUM: Flickr.

KENNEY: Because the guy who owned the domain, the flicker with the E dot-com - he wouldn't sell it to the people. And they loved the name for their company. So their solution was drop the E. Sometimes, you got to do that to find a little space that hasn't been taken.

KESTENBAUM: There are currently over 100 million websites ending in dot-com, which is one reason right now, as I speak, big changes are afoot. New options for website names - not only is there dot-com and dot-gov, dot-edu.

Now dot-ninja has been added. Also, dot-bike, dot-plumbing, dot-cool, - in all, over a thousand new domains, as they're called. They're going to be added. It's like whole new pieces of internet real estate have been opened up.

Everyone who dreamed of getting a short, easy name on the internet - now they can grab one. And it is very much the wild, wild West. There are settlers. And they're new land barons with big dreams hoping to strike it rich.

Hello. And welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

KENNEY: And I'm Caitlin Kenney. Today on the show, we take a tour of the new internet real estate. We meet the dreamers and a skeptic who thinks more land may not be better.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: This world of online web addresses - the rules for it are set by a nonprofit group called ICANN, which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

KENNEY: What a boring-sounding name.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) It's this nonprofit group. It's supposed to be like an impartial caretaker for internet names. And after a long, many-year process of discussing pros and cons and pros and after open forums and position papers and listening to everything anyone had to say, they decided it was time for new names.

Those last letters that you type on a web address like dot-com - that's called a top-level domain. And basically, they're going to allow all kinds of new top-level domains. If you're ICANN, this is a kind of hard thing to explain to the public.

Their best effort is this little cartoon called "The Dot Has Friends," starring this little animated smiley dot thing that goes flying around in a rocket ship.

(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO, "NEW GTLDS: THE DOT HAS NEW FRIENDS!"

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: The dot is making new friends - more than 1,300 of them. And they're going to change the internet like never before.

KENNEY: And in classic internet fashion, anybody who wanted to get one of these new top-level domains - one of the new pieces of real estate - they could apply and try to develop it. You could buy, say, dot-menu, for example, and try to sell it to restaurants who wanted websites ending in dot-menu.

Think of it - joespizza.menu (ph), caitlinscafe.menu (ph). Think of it as an internet island just for restaurants and their menus. Or instead of dot-menu, you could apply for, you know, dot-cats or whatever you wanted, basically.

KESTENBAUM: When Adrienne McAdory heard about this, she thought, I am definitely applying. At the time - couple of years ago - she was working for the Pentagon. She was a contractor doing IT work.

ADRIENNE MCADORY: And I read on the internet that the internet was expanding.

KESTENBAUM: Were you actually, like, at work at the Pentagon thinking about this?

MCADORY: Oh yeah, in the basement.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) You're in the basement of the Pentagon?

MCADORY: In the basement of the Pentagon - in the basement of the Pentagon, in the dungeon with the - where the rest of us peons work.

KESTENBAUM: But then she had this question. Which domain should I apply for?

MCADORY: I was thinking about lifestyle. You know, I wanted to do something with lifestyle. And so then, you know, my girlfriends and I just have incessant conversations about - oh, not married. Can't find the right guy, blah, blah, blah.

KESTENBAUM: That's it, she thought. Weddings - dot-W-E-D - wed. People can put all their wedding pages there - adrianandmartin.wed (ph), maryandjohn.wed (ph), johnandjohn.wed (ph). People would pay for those kinds of sites. So she applied. She had to send in a really long application. There was a $185,000 fee. She used some retirement money. And her dad helped out. And finally, dot-wed was hers.

KENNEY: The thing about owning one of these domains is that once you get it, you're, like, the mayor. You can set the rules. And one of Adrienne's rules is - listen, sweetie. I know you love your spouse, but you can't hold on to that wedding webpage forever.

KESTENBAUM: This, she says, will be enforced in the following way - price to own a dot-WED site for the first year - 70 bucks; second year - 70 bucks; third year - $30,000.

MCADORY: That is because we want you to move on into the sunset and live happily ever after and let the next Mary (ph) and John (ph) have that site.

KESTENBAUM: She figures if 6,000 couples in love buy websites, she'll break even.

KENNEY: That thing about setting your own rules, that's part of the appeal of these new domains. New York, for instance, has dot-NYC. So it can require that all businesses that want to use that have to actually be in New York. If you buy dot-kids, you could pledge to make it totally kid-safe material.

KESTENBAUM: A lot of the new domains are targeting very specific groups. But a couple people are thinking big. I mean, really, why restrict yourself to just people getting married? You could try to become the next dot-com, the next all-purpose ending, the thing you can stick on the back of any business name. After all, dot-com is pretty crowded.

DANIEL NEGARI: All of the good real estate is taken. The only thing that's left is something with a dash or maybe three dashes and a couple numbers in it.

KESTENBAUM: This is Daniel Negari. He's 28 years old, and as far as he knows, the youngest person to be granted one of the new domains. His mom and some fraternity brothers are helping him out. His contender to take on dot-com is dot-xyz.

NEGARI: The way I looked at it was we end the alphabet with X-Y-Z. We should end domain names the same way.

KESTENBAUM: X-Y-Z, it's universal, yet abstract and catchy.

NEGARI: Try and forget it, I dare you.

KESTENBAUM: X-Y-X, you're right.

NEGARI: X-Y-Z, it just sticks. It's natural. It really makes sense.

KESTENBAUM: What about Q-R-S?

NEGARI: Doesn't make sense to me. There's only one ending to the alphabet, and there should only be one ending to a domain name.

KESTENBAUM: Good job working that in again.

NEGARI: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: And he tells me if I want my own personal slice, david.xyz, still available. I've got to say, I was tempted. I still kind of am.

KENNEY: And if you think of it like a land rush, Daniel and Adrienne with dot-WED, they're kind of like pioneers with covered wagons finding a little plot of land, hoping to start a town and convince people to move there. They're standing there saying, come live here. It's awesome. It'll be so easy for your friends and your customers to come and visit. They're individuals taking a chance.

KESTENBAUM: But they're up against some very big developers who are buying up huge swaths of land. Daniel Schindler has been in the internet name business for a long time. He and some other folks raised what he told me was significantly over $100 million to acquire a whole list of clever internet domains - dot-wine, dot-cool, dot-coffee, dot-guru. The list goes on and on.

DANIEL SCHINDLER: Three hundred seven were the number of new domains we applied for.

KESTENBAUM: That's a lot.

SCHINDLER: That - it's a lot. We were the largest applicant in the world by a factor of three. And Google was the second largest applicant with 101.

KESTENBAUM: I asked him, do we really need all this new real estate? I mean, how often do people really even type in web addresses by hand anymore? A lot of people get where they're going using a search engine or following a link on some page. How often do we still type in www.blahblahblah.blah (ph)?

SCHINDLER: Every minute of every day across the world. That's why memorable names are more valuable. You know, when you drive past a billboard or you see a van which has got a sign written, you know, domain name on the side of it, think to yourself how much easier it is to remember if it's a short, meaningful, specific name than a long and convoluted one that by the time you've gone by you can't remember it?

KESTENBAUM: So this is the happy vision for the future of the internet - a cleaner, more spacious, better organized place. And, you know, I could see it happening. I could see 10 years from now looking back and saying remember when everything was dot-com. That was so weird. Schindler says all this new real estate, he thinks it's going to be a good thing.

KENNEY: But there are people out there who think more real estate isn't better. Remember, there are a lot of people, a lot of companies, doing just fine with their dot-com. And for them, all of this new territory can be a threat, another thing they have to worry about.

KESTENBAUM: If you're Toys R Us and you just spent $5 million on toys.com, now you look around and you see there's toys.cool, toys.kid - hell, toys.toys. What do you do? Try to buy them all? Thomas Bradtke (ph) saw this anxiety firsthand. He's an intellectual property attorney who did some work with an organization called WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization. He hung out with a lot of lawyers for big companies.

THOMAS BRADTKE: All of the folks I was there with were brand people, general counsels for brands, and they hated this idea. They absolutely thought it was the worst because they already spent, you know, millions of dollars patrolling and policing dot-com and protecting their brand. And the idea that the internet was going to expand, it was anathema. They had ICANN representatives come and speak to the folks at WIPO, and I thought the assembled lawyers were going to throw fruit. I mean, they hated the idea.

KENNEY: Part of the reason they got freaked out is that we've had some experience with this. Back around 2000, we added about a dozen new top-level domains, including dot-biz, and things did not go well.

KESTENBAUM: Ben Edelman is a professor at Harvard, and he looked at what happened to dot-biz in its first year. He says the people who bought up websites ending in dot-biz didn't really do much with them. Dot-biz ended up being a home for speculators and people buying up property to prevent their competition from getting it.

BEN EDELMAN: It looked like half of the domains in dot-biz that had been sold were actually domains that had been sold to people who wanted to make sure no one else claimed them. And then, of the remaining half, most of them weren't in use. You know, the ratio of dot-biz domains that were actually being used to dot-biz domains that were either being held for future use or being held to prevent other people to use them, it was something like 1 to 10, 1 to 20. It was kind of an unsavory ratio - looked like most of the people were buying this not because they wanted it but because they needed to make sure that they were protected.

KESTENBAUM: The hope is that this time things will be different. There are new protections in place for trademarks and brand names. And also it's 10 years later. There are a lot more people online now. So maybe people are finally dying to bust out of dot-com.

KENNEY: Of course, it's hard to predict what's going to happen to these new domains. It's always possible you've got a nice piece of real estate and still nobody wants to move there. When U.S. settlers headed west, people picked out land that is still just tumbleweeds. But then, of course, there's Phoenix, Ariz. Lots of people want to live there.

KESTENBAUM: Tom Bradtke, the intellectual property lawyer who, by the way, ended up buying dot-menu and a few others with some of his friends, he figures things will change. But dot-com, that weird ending dreamed up in the early days of the internet, it's going to stick around.

BRADTKE: Dot-com is like New York City. Is it going to go away? It's full. It's crowded, but it's also very vital. And these new domains are, you know, the Wild West, and we hope eventually people will build on them.

KENNEY: It's still early days in the Wild West. Adrienne McAdory says it's been a very slow start for dot-WED and she's got competition. Somebody else bought dot-WEDDING. But Adrienne says bring it.

KESTENBAUM: Other domains like dot-guru, that is one of the 307 that Daniel Shindler and friends applied for, they seem to be attracting new settlers at a decent pace. When the websites on dot-guru became available, 50,000 people signed up.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDSTEIN: That was David Kestenbaum and Caitlin Kenney. This is Jacob Goldstein. I'm here back in the present, back in 2016. And to close today's show, we wanted to check in with some of those domains that were just getting started back when we first reported this story in 2014. We reached out to Adrienne McAdory the woman behind dot-wed. Here's what she told us.

MCADORY: Well, all I can say is I'm glad I didn't think this was my Willy Wonka golden ticket because it certainly has not been (laughter). You know, from a bottom line perspective, I haven't made pretty - I practically made no money.

GOLDSTEIN: She says she hasn't given up. She still puts in a few hours a week on dot-WED. But as of right now, there are only about 150 websites registered at that dot-WED domain. We also got in touch with Daniel Negari, owner of dot-xyz. We last talked to him in 2014.

NEGARI: We have a little over 6 million domains that are currently registered. We're the number four generic top-level domain in the world behind com, net and org.

GOLDSTEIN: One big moment for Daniel came last summer when Alphabet, the parent company of Google, made its home page abc.xyz. One last detail - after our original PLANET MONEY episode aired a couple years ago, Negari got sued by Verisign. They are the company that owns dot-com.

NEGARI: They sued me for saying that I'm the next dot-com, and apparently they didn't like that.

GOLDSTEIN: Negari won that case, but VeriSign is appealing. Today's show was originally produced by Jess Jiang. The rerun was produced by Elizabeth Kulas with help from Mark Bramhill (ph). Thanks also to Matthew Zuke (ph) for his help with those domain numbers. I'm Jacob Goldstein. Thanks for listening.

Hey, it's Jacob Goldstein today's show is a rerun. It was first reported by Caitlin Kenny and David Kestendom back in
2014 here it is

You just type MIT
So even computer people prefer to have letters the numbers. Oh, yes
Computer people really are just like everybody else
They're people this it turns out was only a temporary fix the number of computers connected grew to the hundreds and more
Someone needed to take charge to build a new naming system to bring order to the growing chaos and this historic task
Was given to Paul Macha Petrus who?
Well, he just got his PhD
You know, the only reason I got the job was nobody thought it was important and so we have a new
PhD let's give him the this job Paul says there was this big debate going on
Some people wanted this internet thing organized by country. Other people said come on. Let's be more international about it
Let's group things by type and so the idea of ending web addresses with a dot and then a few letters was born

Cuz I actually never thought that it stood for anything
I've just been so used to typing dot-com my whole life
I actually never thought about what dot-com stands you just type those four
Yeah
I just kind of thought it was random and it was assigned for a reason and and the thing that's crazy about it
Is that this little quirk it ended up having really big consequences for the Internet because think about it
Everybody wants the good names the dot-com names like imagine you have a business and it's called Joe's pizza
So the first person who gets on the Internet gets Joe's pizza dot-com. That's it. They're good
They have a nice clean website name, but then all the other Joe's pizzas out there all across the US
They have to add words and letters
They have to become big Joe's pizza calm Joe's pizza on seventh calm happy Joe's calm tomato Joe's pizza calm
You left out Joe's pizza of the village
Right because that one's easy to remember
So for the people who were not first who were not lucky
Some of them have had to pay big money to the people who got those simple website names first toys are us for
Instance bought toys calm for five million dollars sex calm sold for 13 million dollars
This is the reason you know the photo-sharing website Flickr. It's actually spelled
Flickr no e
Because the guy who owned the domain the Flickr with the e.com
He wouldn't sell it to the people and they loved to the name for their company
So their solution was drop the e sometimes you got to do that to find a little space that hasn't been taken
There are currently over a hundred million websites ending in calm
Which is one reason right now as I speak big changes are afoot new options for website names
Not only is there dot com and dot gov dot edu now
Dot ninja has been added so dot bike dot plumbing dot cool in all over a thousand new
Domains as they're called they're gonna be added
It's like whole new pieces of internet real estate have been opened up everyone who dreamed of getting a short easy name on
The internet now they can grab one and it is very much the wild wild west
There are settlers and their new land barons with big dreams hoping to strike it rich
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm David Kestenbaum and I'm Caitlin Kenny today on the show
We take a tour of the new internet real estate
We meet the dreamers and a skeptic who thinks more land may not be better
We'd like to say a quick. Thank you and share a message from our Planet Money sponsor betterment

This world of online web addresses the rules for it are set by a non-profit group called ICANN
Which stands for Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. What a boring sound
It's this non-profit group
It's supposed to be like an impartial caretaker for internet names and after a long
Many year process of discussing pros and cons and pros and after open forums and position papers and listening to everything anyone had to say
They decided it was time for new names those last letters that you type on a web address like
Dot-com that's called a top-level domain and basically they're gonna allow all kinds of new top-level domains if you're ICANN
This is a kind of hard thing to explain to the public
Their best effort is this little cartoon called the dot has friends starring this little animated
Smiley dot thing that goes flying around in a rocket ship the dot is making new friends more than
1300 of them and they're going to change the internet like never before
And in classic internet fashion anybody who wanted to get one of these new top-level domains one of the new pieces of real estate
They could apply and try to develop it
You could buy say dot menu for example and try to sell it to restaurants who wanted websites ending in dot menu
Think of it Joe's pizza dot menu Caitlin's cafe dot menu
think of it as an internet island just for restaurants and their menus or
Instead of dot menu you could apply for you know dot cats or whatever you wanted basically when Adrienne McAdory heard about this
She thought I am definitely applying at the time a couple years ago. She was working for the Pentagon
She was a contractor doing IT work, and I read on the internet that the internet was expanding
Were you actually like at work at the Pentagon thinking about this? Oh, yeah in the basement
In the basement of the Pentagon in the basement of the Pentagon in the basement of the Pentagon in the dungeon with the where the
Rest of us peons work, but then she had this question which domain should I apply for I was thinking about lifestyle
I you know I want to do something with lifestyle
And so then you know my girlfriends, and I just have incessant conversations about oh, we're not married
You can't find the right guy blah blah blah. That's it. She thought weddings dot
Wed people can put all their wedding pages there Adrienne and Martin dot wed Mary and John dot wed John and John dot wed
People would pay for those kinds of sites so she applied she had to send in a really long
Application there was a hundred and eighty five thousand dollar fee
She used some retirement money and her dad helped out and finally dot wed was hers
The thing about owning one of these domains is that once you get it you're like the mayor
You can set the rules and one of the Adrienne's rules is
Listen, sweetie. I know you love your spouse, but you can't hold on to that wedding web page forever
This she says will be enforced in the following way price to own a dot website for the first year 70 bucks
Second year 70 bucks third year
$30,000 that is because we want you to
Move on into the sunset and live happily ever after and let the next Mary and John have that site
She figures if six thousand couples in love by websites
She'll break even that thing about setting your own rules. That's part of the appeal of these new domains
New York for instance has dot NYC
So it can require that all businesses that want to use that have to actually be in New York
If you buy dot kids you could pledge to make it totally kid safe material
A lot of the new domains are targeting very specific groups, but a couple people are thinking big
I mean really why restrict yourself to just people getting married?
You could try to become the next dot-com the next all-purpose ending the thing you can stick on the back of any business
Name after all dot-com is pretty crowded all of the good real estate is taken
The only thing that's left is something with a dash and or maybe three dashes and a couple numbers in it
This is Daniel Nagari
He's 28 years old and as far as he knows the youngest person to be granted one of the new domains
His mom and some fraternity brothers are helping him out his contender to take on dot-com is
dot X Y Z
The way I looked at it was we end the alphabet with X Y Z. We should end domain names the same way
X Y Z it's universal yet abstract and catchy try and forget it. I dare you
X Y X
You're right
X Y Z it just sticks. It's natural. It really makes sense. What about QRS?
Doesn't make sense to me. It's only one ending to the alphabet and there should only be one ending to a domain name
Good job working that in again
Andy tells me if I want my own personal slice David dot XYZ still available
Gotta say I was tempted. I still kind of am and if you think of it like a land rush
Daniel and Adrian with that wed
They're kind of like pioneers with covered wagons finding a little plot of land
Hoping to start a town and convince people to move there. They're standing there saying come live here. It's awesome
It'll be so easy for your friends and your customers to come and visit their individuals taking a chance
But they're up against some very big developers who are buying up huge swaths of land
Daniel Schindler has been in the internet name business for a long time
He and some other folks raised what he told me was
Significantly over 100 million dollars to acquire a whole list of clever internet domains
Wine cool coffee guru the list goes on and on
307 with the number of new domains we applied for that's a lot that it's a lot
We were the largest applicant in the world by a factor of three
Google was the second largest applicant with a hundred and one
I asked him do we really need all this new real estate?
I mean how often do people really even type in web addresses by hand anymore a lot of people get where they're going
Using a search engine or following a link on some page. How do we still type in?
www.blah blah blah blah
Every minute of every day across the world that that's why memorable names are more valuable
You know when you drive past a billboard or you see a van which has got a sign written
You know domain name on the side of it
Think to yourself how much easier it is to remember if it's a short and meaningful
Specific name then a long and convoluted one that by the time you've gone by you can't remember it
So this is the happy vision for the future of the internet a cleaner more spacious better organized place
And you know I could see it happening
I could see ten years from now looking back and saying remember when everything was dot-com that was so weird
Schindler says all this new real estate. He thinks it's gonna be a good thing
But there are people out there who think more real estate isn't better remember
There are a lot of people a lot of companies doing just fine with their dot-com and for them all of this new territory
It can be a threat
Another thing they have to worry about if your toys are us and you just spent five million dollars on toys dot-com
Now you look around and you see there's toys dot cool toys dot kid help toys dot toys
What do you do try to buy them all Thomas Brackey saw this anxiety firsthand?
He's an intellectual property attorney who did some work with an organization called WIPO the world intellectual property organization
He hung out with a lot of lawyers for big companies all of the folks
I was there with were brand people general counsels for brands and they hated this idea
They absolutely thought it was the worst because they already spent you know millions of dollars
patrolling and policing dot-com and protecting their brand the idea that the internet was going to expand it was anathema
They had I can representatives come and speak to the folks at WIPO and I thought
The assembled lawyers were gonna throw fruit
I mean they hated the idea part of the reason they got freaked out is that we've had some experience with this back around
2000 we added about a dozen new top-level domains
Including dot biz and things did not go well
Ben Edelman is a professor at Harvard and he looked at what happened to dot biz in its first year
He says the people who bought up websites ending in dot biz didn't really do much with them
That biz ended up being a home for speculators and people buying up property to prevent their competition from getting it
It looked like half of the domains in dot biz that had been sold
we're actually domains that had been sold to people who wanted to make sure no one else claimed them and
Then of the remaining half most of them weren't in use
You know the ratio of dot biz domains that were actually being used
To dot biz domains that were either being held for future use or being held to prevent other people to use them
Was something like one to ten one to twenty it was kind of an unsavory ratio looked like most of the people were buying this
Not because they wanted it
But because they needed to make sure that they were protected the hope is that this time things will be different
There are new protections in place for trademarks and brand names and also it's ten years later
There are a lot more people online now
So maybe people are finally dying to bust out of dot-com of course
It's hard to predict what's gonna happen to these new domains
It's always possible you've got a nice piece of real estate and still nobody wants to move there when US settlers headed west
People picked out land that is still just tumbleweeds
But then of course there's Phoenix, Arizona
Lots of people want to live there Tom Bracke the intellectual property lawyer who by the way ended up buying dot menu and a few
Others with some of his friends he figures things will change but dot-com that weird ending dreamed up in the early days of
The internet it's gonna stick around dot-com is like New York City
It's gonna go away
It's it's it's full. It's crowded, but it's also very vital and these new domains are you know the Wild West and
We hope eventually people will will build on them
It's still early days in the Wild West
Adrian McAdory says it's been a very slow start for dot-wed and she's got competition
Somebody else bought dot-wedding
But Adrian says bring it other domains like dot guru
That is one of the 307 that Daniel Schindler and friends applied for
They seem to be attracting new settlers at a decent pace when the websites on doc guru became available
50,000 people signed up that was David Kestenbaum and Caitlin Kenny. This is Jacob Goldstein
I'm here back in the present back in 2016 and to close today's show
We wanted to check in with some of those domains that were just getting started back when we first reported the story in 2014
We reached out to Adrian McAdory the woman behind dot-wed. Here's what she told us
Well, all I can say is I'm glad I didn't think this was my
Willy Wonka golden ticket because it certainly has not been
You know from a bottom-line perspective I haven't made
Pretty I effectively need no money. She says she hasn't given up
She still puts in a few hours a week on dot-wed
But as of right now, there are only about 150 websites registered at that
We also got in touch with Daniel Nagari owner of dot XYZ. We last talked to him in 2014
We have over six million domains that are currently registered
We're the number four generic top-level domain in the world behind comnet and org
One big moment for Daniel came last summer when alphabet the parent company of Google made its homepage
ABC dot XYZ
One last detail after our original Planet Money episode aired a couple years ago
Negari got sued by VeriSign. They are the company that owns dot-com
they sued me for saying that I'm the next dot-com and
Apparently they didn't like that Negari won that case but VeriSign is appealing
