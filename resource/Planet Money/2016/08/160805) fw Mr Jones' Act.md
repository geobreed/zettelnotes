There's an obscure law that governs just about anything that travels by ship in the U.S. — bananas, hairdryers, gasoline, even people. Economists do not like it. But it just won't go away.

Note: This episode originally aired in March, 2014.

If you want to send a bunch of oranges by truck from Florida to Baltimore, no one cares who made the truck. Or if you want to fly computer chips across the country, it's fine if the plane is made in France. But if you want send cargo by ship, there's a law that the ship has to be American made.

Here's why: a 90-year-old law, called the Jones Act. Every time you want to send something from one US port to another, the cargo must travel on a ship built in the U.S., staffed by mostly Americans, and flying the American flag.

Today on the show, we look at the all the unexpected places this law pops up from cruise ships, to cattle farms, and suburban New Jersey, where a guy really, really needs salt.

ALEX GOLDMARK, HOST:

Hey, it's Alex Goldmark here. Today, we are replaying one of our favorite episodes. It was originally reported by Zoe Chace and David Kestenbaum back in the winter of 2014. OK. Here is today's episode.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

ZOE CHACE, HOST:

I'm at this dock in midtown Manhattan. Over on the west side, the Hudson River. We don't really think of the city as a port anymore, but it is, for cruise ships. I'm looking up at these two enormous boats. They're as big as apartment buildings. It's windy and cold. And these boats are going to the Bahamas. It was busy before out here, but now it's quiet. Everyone is on board. The ship is getting ready to leave. All of a sudden, this family comes tearing around the corner, roly (ph) suitcases are bouncing, their backpacks, all their stuff. They're rushing to the boat, and a port employee is yelling at them, come on.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK, run to the left, run to the left.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Run to the left, run, run, run to the left.

CHACE: And they just miss it. The gangplank is up.

(SOUNDBITE OF FOGHORN)

CHACE: This poor mom, her teenage son, slumped down into chairs sulking. They all sit in this little terminal. We can see the ship through the window getting ready to leave. Mom gets on the phone to Norwegian Cruise Lines. It turns out there may be a way to catch the ship before it hits the Bahamas because it stops in Orlando for, like, a day and maybe the family can get on a plane to Florida and save the vacation.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We're trying to contact Norwegian to see if they'll allow us to board in Orlando.

CHACE: On the phone, she's taking notes. The news is good.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So we can board in Florida.

CHACE: You can?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: However (laughter) as long as you're boarding in the United States, you will have to pay up to $300 per person extra to board.

CHACE: Did they tell you why?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's a booking - what did she say it was? And she said it falls under the Jones Act. So I don't know. In your research look up the Jones Act (laughter).

CHACE: She's written the words Jones Act on her notepad, underlined it and put a big box around it.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

We here at PLANET MONEY did not have to look it up. We've actually been wanting to do a story about the Jones Act for a while. It is one of those really old laws that pops up in all these strange places. The Jones Act was written over 90 years ago, but today, it still governs just about anything that travels by ship in America - bananas, hair dryers, gasoline, even people.

CHACE: The core of the Jones Act dictates that every time you want to send something from one U.S. port to another U.S. port, the cargo must travel on a ship built in America staffed by Americans owned by Americans. The cruise ship, like all cruise ships, was foreign-owned.

KESTENBAUM: This is a pretty unusual requirement if you think about it. If you want to send a bunch of oranges by truck from Florida to Baltimore, it doesn't matter who made the truck. The truck can be made in Germany. You want to fly some computer chips across the country. It's fine if the planes in Airbus made in France. But you want to send cargo by ship, has to be a ship made in America.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

CHACE: And I'm Zoe Chace. Today on the show, we dig into the words that the woman scribbled on her notepad - the Jones Act. We will get all its strange consequences that play out in all these crazy ways in this country - cruise ship passengers, cattle farmers, a guy in New Jersey who really, really needed some salt - a mountain of salt.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: So the Jones Act, it actually popped up in my life recently. I live in New Jersey. And a couple weeks ago, in the middle of, like, five snowstorms, we found out that the state had run out of salt. It had run out of rock salt to melt the snow and the ice, which is a really dangerous thing to run out of.

CHACE: And there was a fairly simple solution. New Jersey didn't have salt, but the state of Maine had a giant mountain of it. And as it turns out, right in a port in Maine, there was this really big ship that seemed like it could carry all the salt to New Jersey.

JOE DEE: I mean, it was just like serendipity. Here's this ship that's big enough to take 40,000 tons of salt. It's on its way to Newark anyway. This is perfect.

KESTENBAUM: That's Joe Dee, one of the guys in charge of getting salt for New Jersey. He had one problem, though. You can almost picture him writing it on his notepad and drawing a big box around it - the Jones Act. That ship was not made in America, not flying an American flag, and the captain, as it turns out, was Greek. Jones Act says you cannot use that kind of ship to carry anything from one U.S. port to another.

CHACE: The work around was quite painful. The U.S. doesn't build that many ships anymore, especially compared to other countries. And the only Jones Act-compliant ship was this little barge.

KESTENBAUM: Zoe, you really wanted to see this little barge?

CHACE: Yes.

KESTENBAUM: So one morning you headed out.

CHACE: Hey, man. I'm here (laughter). I'm here. I'm looking at it, dude.

KESTENBAUM: And, Zoe, you recorded your best weather reporter on the scene.

CHACE: I'm standing here at Berth 13 looking at this barge that's filled with rock salt, salt to melt the snow, that just came down here from Searsport, Maine, to New Jersey.

KESTENBAUM: We also asked reporter Jay Field in Maine to do his part at the mountain of salt.

JAY FIELD, BYLINE: I'm Jay Field in Searsport, Maine, where the rock salt just came from. And, Zoe, what's funny is that there is still a huge pile of salt in front of me.

KESTENBAUM: The barge was not nearly big enough to carry that mountain of salt, at least not in one trip, hence the workaround.

CHACE: OK. So this is the plan. They're going to drop off the rock salt here, and then this barge is going to turn around and head back up to you.

FIELD: And it's going to pick up another fraction of this large pile and head back down to you.

CHACE: And then it's going to drop off the rock salt here in New Jersey and turn around and head back to you.

FIELD: And pick up...

KESTENBAUM: The Jones Act has been around for over 90 years. And at this point, coming up with workarounds has become a sort of art form in the maritime world. Hawaii is really the master. You know, in New Jersey you can drive there or send stuff by train. Hawaii - there is no train that goes to Hawaii. If you want to bring stuff from Hawaii back to the rest of the United States, it's probably going to have to go by boat.

CHACE: I talked to this one cattle rancher in Hawaii. His name is Pono Von Holt. He raises cows in Hawaii, but the market for burgers is across the ocean on the mainland.

KESTENBAUM: And the Jones Act says he needs to use American ships. And the thing about ships made in America crewed by Americans is that they are expensive. They're expensive to manufacture and expensive to run.

CHACE: Pono told me, for a while, he was using foreign ships, and what he would do is he would send the cows to Canada and then they traveled by land over the border back to the United States. That didn't work out. These days, he's doing something that sounds crazier, which is he sends some of the cows to the mainland by airplane. To save money, he sends the cows when they're little and don't weigh so much.

KESTENBAUM: People, like cows, are also subject to these old laws. That was the problem that the family ran into with the cruise ship. It is illegal for a foreign-owned cruise ship to pick you up in one U.S. port and drop you in another, which is why the family had to pay a fine for getting on in Orlando. The cruise ship at the end of the trip was going to drop everyone off in New York.

CHACE: Economists - you may have guessed they are not fans of the Jones Act. When cows fly, it's a sign that there are some real distortions in the maritime shipping business.

KESTENBAUM: We called up Joseph Stiglitz. He used to chair the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. He said the council took a look at the Jones Act and said, OK, look, it does save some jobs in the shipping industry, but it also makes all kinds of other things cost way more than they should. How much are we paying to save those jobs? They did the math.

JOSEPH STIGLITZ: So we did this calculation and asked the question, how much did each job cost?

KESTENBAUM: What was the answer?

STIGLITZ: It was something like a quarter million dollars a job.

CHACE: What do you make of that number?

STIGLITZ: Well, that it was a very inefficient way of job creation.

KESTENBAUM: Stupid?

STIGLITZ: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: Is there any economic argument in favor of the Jones Act?

STIGLITZ: Other than an argument of certain special interests, no.

KESTENBAUM: So no.

STIGLITZ: No (laughter).

KESTENBAUM: Do you know any economists who like the Jones Act?

STIGLITZ: No, I don't. I've never met one.

KESTENBAUM: According to an official report around this time by the United States International Trade Commission, the Jones Act was costing the country over $1 billion every year.

CHACE: So why does this thing exist? The basic idea of requiring that cargo travel on domestic ships goes back centuries. But this current incarnation, the Jones Act, is from 1920. So 1920 - World War I had just ended. During the war, the government geared up to build ship after ship after ship. But then, the war ended, and the ships were still being built. Here's a maritime historian, Jeff Bolster.

JEFF BOLSTER: There's this glut of ships. I mean, they're still being churned out now in these shipyards owned by the Emergency Fleet Corporation, OK? As a result of that, anybody could see that in the short-run ship building was going to become depressed because the government had stepped in to build all of this tonnage to win the war. It also means that the market would be saturated with tonnage for a while. So that shipbuilding yards would simply not have anything to do.

KESTENBAUM: And you know where there were a lot of shipyards? Seattle, Washington state, and Washington state happened to have a very powerful senator - head of the Commerce Committee - Senator Wesley L. Jones. Senator Jones, concerned about his hometown shipbuilding industry, pushes Congress to pass the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Jones Act.

CHACE: And it received some news coverage at the time. Here is a snippet from a news story written by one J.J. Underwood.

KESTENBAUM: You want to do it?

CHACE: Here I go. (Reading) Indirectly, it affects the foreign transportation of every product of American industry. Upon it is also dependent the industrial expansion of the nation. Literally, thousands of different interests will be affected by it.

KESTENBAUM: That ran in The Seattle Times, Jones' home state, which, over the years, clearly benefited from the hard work of their senator.

CHACE: In fact, the barge with the salt in New Jersey, that was made in Seattle - Jones Act for the win.

KESTENBAUM: The other argument for the Jones Act made at the time was military readiness. Basically, if we get into another war, we're going to need American ships and Americans who know how to sail them.

CHACE: And this is the argument that the shipbuilding industry makes today.

DARRELL CONNER: There are certain things in this country that are core to protecting the country. Shipbuilding industrial base just happens to be one of those.

CHACE: Darrell Conner is a lobbyist with the American Maritime Partnership. He represents U.S. shipbuilders, U.S. shipbuilding companies. In wartime, he says you need people who know how to make ships, war ships that we use to fight battles. And you also need ordinary cargo ships for supplies and food and medical stuff.

CONNER: Almost 90 percent of the cargoes carried in the Iraqi and Afghanistan wars were carried on U.S.-flag ships. Now, those weren't Jones Act ships, but a lot of the seafarers that served on those vessels served in the Jones Act trade, so the Jones Act plays a vital role in ensuring we have those seafarers.

KESTENBAUM: So what he's saying here is, OK, it is true, even with the Jones Act we don't have enough ships to supply our troops during wartime. We have to use other countries' ships. But the Jones Act gives us some, and it gives us trained captains and crew.

KESTENBAUM: The economist Joseph Stiglitz says he heard those arguments when he was in the Clinton administration. No one on the Council of Economic Advisers found them very convincing. We are dependent on foreign countries for a lot of stuff - oil, food, steel, clothes. We need to use the ports of our allies in Europe. Why do we have to insist on American-made ships with an American crew flying under an American flag?

STIGLITZ: I think the view of the Council of Economic Advisers was very strong that we should get rid of it. We're not, you know, we're the - we're advisers (laughter) so we can just say what are the economic costs? And is there a plausible argument that there are any benefits commensurate with the cost? And we could not see any.

KESTENBAUM: And then what happened next?

STIGLITZ: Well, I think nothing.

CHACE: It's a political nonstarter. It's been that way for 90 years. When the U.S. military teams up with unions and shipbuilders, that is a lot of lobbying power. Put that up against a mom who missed the cruise ship, a guy who needs a bunch of salt, a Hawaiian cattle rancher - they don't stand a chance.

KESTENBAUM: Academics have a fancy term for this. The Jones Act has concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. A small group of people benefit a lot. The cost gets passed onto the rest of us in little, hidden ways.

CHACE: The only way the Jones Act is going to change is if the costs become more obvious and more powerful people start yelling about getting rid of it. That could happen because of the way that our economy is changing at this moment. The U.S., as you probably know, is in the middle of an oil boom thanks to fracking. If you want to send oil from Houston to Philadelphia by sea, you have to use a Jones Act ship. And there are not that many of those. So the price is going up, and U.S. oil producers are starting to get really mad about this restriction.

KESTENBAUM: But for the moment, you've got to play by the rules laid out in the Jones Act. If you're sending something from one U.S. port to another, it's got to be on a ship built in America with an American crew flying an American flag.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDMARK: Alex here back in 2016 where the oil boom is ongoing, and we're going to have a whole lot more about that in the coming weeks. It's going to be fun. Stay tuned. But about the Jones Act, it has not gone away. In fact, last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened a new division in New Orleans to boost enforcement and education about the law.

And something fun for you now. A few weeks back, in Episode 712, that was the I Want My Money Back show, we asked you to tell us about times you found yourself in that situation, wanting your money back. And we got dozens of voice memos, lots more emails and they all help. They all help us think through new ideas for new shows, come up with new story ideas, so please keep them coming.

OK. One thing we noticed is that a lot of health care issues left you wanting your money back. There was one from Brent Williams (ph) from LA. He wanted his money back after taking a short ambulance ride that cost him $1,200. He did not get a refund after asking for it. So he says the next time he's going to call Uber.

And then there was guilt. Guilt was a theme for a lot of you. Oliver Lucas-Guarda (ph) from Spain told us about how he bought some bad headphones that kept breaking, so he kept returning them, kept getting a free new set of headphones. And then after they broke again, totally his fault this time, he thought...

OLIVER LUCAS-GUARDA: I'm going to go ahead and pretend like it wasn't my fault. And like clockwork, they sent me another pair a week later. But I slept well that night knowing that they would have broken anyways.

GOLDMARK: And the last thing we noticed was that getting your money back is about the principle so much more often than it is about the math. Alia Abbott (ph) of San Francisco was on vacation in Paris. She bought some souvenir dancing dolls from a street vendor for about $20, but they didn't work. So the next day, she got on the subway, found the same vendor, hounded him and scared away all his customers until she got her money back. All that effort, the cost of the subway, the lost time on her vacation, she said totally worth it.

ALIA ABBOTT: I mean, the one thing it did right (ph) is it took this experience that was very negative, this experience of feeling cheated and feeling like an idiot. So I think it did, like, take this sort of icky memory and turn it into, like, a fun adventure memory.

but a lot of the seafarers that served on those vessels served in the Jones Act trade.
So the Jones Act plays a vital role in ensuring we have those seafarers.
So what he's saying here is, OK, it is true.
Even with the Jones Act, we don't have enough ships to supply our troops during wartime.
We have to use other countries' ships.
But the Jones Act gives us some, and it gives us trained captains and crew.
The economist Joseph Stiglitz says he heard those arguments when he was in the Clinton administration.
No one on the Council of Economic Advisers found them very convincing.
We are dependent on foreign countries for a lot of stuff.
Oil, food, steel, clothes.
We need to use the ports of our allies in Europe.
Why do we have to insist on American-made ships
with an American crew flying under an American flag?
I think the view of the Council of Economic Advisers was very strong that we should get rid of it.
But we're not, you know, we're advisors.
So we can just say, what are the economic costs?
And is there a plausible argument that there are any benefits to making sure with the cost?
And we could not see any.
And then what happened next?
Well, I think nothing.
It's a political nine-starter.
It's been that way for 90 years.
When the U.S. military teams up with unions and shipbuilders, that is a lot of lobbying power.
Put that up against a mom who missed the cruise ship, a guy who needs a bunch of salt, a Hawaiian cattle rancher.
They don't stand a chance.
Academics have a fancy term for this.
The Jones Act has concentrated benefits and diffuse costs.
A small group of people benefit a lot.
The cost gets passed on to the rest of us in little hidden ways.
The only way the Jones Act is going to change is if the costs become more obvious
and more powerful people start yelling about getting rid of it.
That could happen because of the way that our economy is changing at this moment.
The U.S., as you probably know, is in the middle of an oil boom thanks to fracking.
If you want to send oil from Houston to Philadelphia by sea, you have to use a Jones Act ship.
And there are not that many of those.
So the price is going up, and U.S. oil producers are starting to get really mad about this restriction.
But for the moment, you've got to play by the rules laid out in the Jones Act.
If you're sending something from one U.S. port to another,
it's got to be on a ship built in America with an American crew flying an American flag.
Alex here back in 2016, where the oil boom is ongoing.
And we're going to have a whole lot more about that in the coming weeks.
It's going to be fun. Stay tuned.
But about the Jones Act, it has not gone away.
In fact, last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection opened a new division in New Orleans
to boost enforcement and education about the law.
And something fun for you now.
Now, a few weeks back in episode 712, that was the I Want My Money Back show,
we asked you to tell us about times you found yourself in that situation wanting your money back.
And we got dozens of voice memos, lots more emails.
And they all help. They all help us think through new ideas for new shows,
come up with new story ideas. So please keep them coming.
OK, one thing we noticed is that a lot of health care issues left you wanting your money back.
There was one from Brent Williams from L.A.
He wanted his money back after taking a short ambulance ride that cost him $1,200.
He did not get a refund after asking for it.
So he says the next time he's going to call Uber.
And then there was guilt. Guilt was a theme for a lot of you.
Oliver Lucas Guardo from Spain told us about how he bought some bad headphones that kept breaking.
So he kept returning them, kept getting a free new set of headphones.
And then after they broke again, totally his fault this time, he thought,
I'm going to go ahead and pretend like it wasn't my fault.
And like clockwork, they sent me another pair a week later.
But I slept well that night knowing that they would have broken anyway.
And the last thing we noticed was that getting your money back is about the principle so much more often than it is about the math.
Alia Abbott of San Francisco was on vacation in Paris.
She bought some souvenir dancing dolls from a street vendor for about $20, but they didn't work.
So the next day she got on the subway, found the same vendor,
hounded him and scared away all his customers until she got her money back.
All that effort, the cost of the subway, the lost time on her vacation, she said, totally worth it.

**faster whisper:**
Stacy Vanik Smith. Robert Smith. I am so excited for this trip. Let's make sure we
have everything. We have our tickets, right? We have airplane tickets. We have
our tickets. We're flying into Kansas City, Missouri, and then we're driving
into Kansas. We're renting a car. And we have hotels where? In Wichita. McPherson,
Kansas. And Omaha. And Omaha. Yeah. And we have found somebody who will sell
Planet Money 100 barrels of crude oil. Yes, we did. Yes, we did. It was a long
journey. It was a really long journey. In order to buy crude oil, Planet Money had
to register as an official purchaser of oil in the state of Kansas. And we had
to find middlemen. We had to find truckers. We had to find a refinery
willing to take our oil. And then there was NPR management. They kind of
freaked out when we took this idea to them. They were like, what if you
spill the oil? Yeah, an NPR oil spill sounds terrible. That sounds really bad.
Also, what if you can't sell it? What are you going to do? Take 100 barrels of oil
and stack them in the office? But we worked it out. We have finally worked it
out. And Stacey, Stacey, look what I got. Why did you get a briefcase? So
that I could make that little click. What's in the briefcase? Look what's
inside. That is a stack of hundreds. How much money is this? $10,000. I'm
holding $10,000. NPR's money. I've never held this much money in my
life. I could run outside and buy a car. Give it back. I'm putting it back in the
briefcase. Let's go buy 100 barrels of crude oil. Let's do it.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Robert Smith. And I'm Stacey
Vanick-Smith. Oil is one of the biggest economic forces on earth. It
has driven industrial progress and technology. It has shaped our
civilization and it's an intimate part of our lives. Oil is in our phones,
our clothes, our food, our medicine. Oil has given us all of these gifts,
but it has also exacted an enormous price. Dealing with climate change
and getting off of oil are two of the biggest challenges we face as a
planet. In spite of all of this, most of us have never even seen oil
in its raw form. And even though oil companies are some of the biggest
businesses in the world, it is really hard to get inside of them. The
whole industry is sort of veiled in mystery. Here at Planet Money,
we thought the best way to see into the business of oil would be to
get into the business of oil. Today on the show, that is exactly what
we're going to do. Over the next few episodes of Planet Money,
we are going into the oil business. We are going to buy a tanker
full of crude oil. We are going to transport it. We are going to
sell the oil, refine the oil and ship it through a pipeline to its
final customer. Your gas tank. To your gas tank. Now, you know,
if we had done this story, you know, five years ago, 10 years
ago, we would be flying to Saudi Arabia and trying to do a deal with
them. Yes, and we would also need a much bigger briefcase. Because
of course, oil was far expensive then. Yes, exactly. But these
days, the biggest producer of petroleum in the world is us.
It's the United States. Over the next five episodes, we are
going inside the US oil business. We're going to meet the people
and make the deals ourselves. In cash. In cash. First step, we
have an appointment with a preacher in Kansas. We'd like to
say a quick thank you and share a message from our Planet
Money sponsor, Discover. You check things all the time, like
your email or social media. But Discover asks, what about
checking something as important as your credit score?
Well, Discover makes it quick and easy with the Discover
credit scorecard. Discover is the only major credit card to
offer FICO credit scores to everyone for free, even if
you're not a customer. And once you know your FICO credit
score, you should check to see if your current credit card
is the best fit for you. Learn more at discover.com slash
credit scorecard. Limitations apply.
I'm going to be honest with you. I came to suspect that
this project we were doing at Planet Money was cursed, was
cursed from the very beginning because everyone kept saying
no, no, we are not going to sell oil to you. No, you
can't do that. No, that is not physically possible.
Finally, a Kansas oil man named Jason Brun said, yes,
he had a tank full of crude oil that he would be willing to
sell us. Also, he's a pastor, so we figured we could trust
him. And we booked our tickets.
Then over the 4th of July weekend, we got bad news
about our oil tank.
It got hit by lightning.
It got hit by lightning?
Yeah, it burned the oil up. So there was nothing left.
Was there a fireball or what happened?
Yeah, yeah, that's it burned for two or three hours
and tanks that are split in half, and the tops are
blowed out of them and ash everywhere. And all the
trees around it or the few the few trees that are
around or burn up and all the it's just burned up is
ash. It looks like a forest fire.
We seriously talked about giving up.
But a few weeks later, Jason called us up and said he
had another well with oil that he'd be willing to
sell us. So he gave us directions to a cow pasture
close to the border of Kansas and Oklahoma.
So it's Friday morning in Wichita, Kansas, we get
up, we are ready to head down there. And this is
what we hear.
We are cursed. We're cursed.
It is pouring rain and the oil truck that was going
to haul our oil calls us up and says, no way are we
going to be able to get our truck into that muddy
field to get your oil.
Yeah, but we go anyway.
Oh, there's cows. Oh, wait, there's a lot of
cows.
You know, I think I was picturing some barren
wasteland with oil derricks as far as the eye
could see. But in Kansas, the oil wells are
really charming and beautiful, actually.
Oh, they're coming this way. All right.
Go.
They're tucked into these vast fields of wheat and
corn. And so Robert and I drive down this long
straight road.
All the roads in Kansas are precisely straight.
That's true. And we veer off into this prairie
grass through this herd of black cows. And we
find Jason.
Hey, good to meet you, Jason.
Nice to meet you.
He is a big man with an outlaws beard. He's
standing next to his red pickup and next to
him is this rusty machine plunging a metal rod
into the mud.
So what are we looking at right now?
What are you looking at? Oh, that's a pumping
unit.
A pumping unit. Just like in the movies. It
goes up and down. Yeah, it's like a like a
teeter totter, I've been told. And other
people I've heard say it looks like a big
hammer. But to me, it's just a pump unit.
I've been looking at them since I can
remember. I was four years old. So it's
always been a pump unit to me.
This is where our oil is coming from out of
this well. Although I have to say it looked
a little rough around the edges.
It's a little janky.
But Jason tells us it has been running for
40 years, almost as long as he has been
alive.
Jason's done just about all the jobs you
can do on an oil field. He was a
roustabout, which is basically like a
handyman. He's drilled wells, then
he's taken wells apart when the oil
ran out. And on Sundays, he
preaches the gospel.
I'm not your cookie cutter mold for
preacher. I'm probably not your
cookie. I know I'm not your cookie
cutter mold for an oil producer.
He's been doing this since he was a
kid traveling from well to well with
his grandfather. When he was 23, he
had his first accident.
We were we were working on a well, one
of my grandpa's wells one day, and I
stepped over beside the rig and grabbed
a chain and hooked the chain up.
And he tightened into it with about
10,000 pounds of pressure.
And my hand was between it and the
piece of metal. And metal doesn't
give.
What did you do?
I mean, you just screamed or what?
I just said, I said, ah, and then
my grandpa loosened off the break.
And whenever he looked at me, I
said, let's go to the hospital.
And he said, no, he said, let me
see it. And I said, no, it's bad.
I'm messed up.
I lost my finger.
Jason holds up his hand.
It's this big, strong hand.
And there is a stump where his
middle finger used to be.
But the point of the story isn't
actually about his finger or even
being careful on oil fields or
anything like that.
Jason tells us the story because
he is still amazed at what his
grandfather did after he dropped
Jason off at the hospital.
And he said, well, I guess you
don't need me to go.
We're going to go finish up.
Is that all right?
I said, that's fine with me.
So he went back to the site.
Yeah, he went back and finished
the job. So they worked that
night till about five o'clock
at night.
My grandpa's the toughest man I
ever knew in my life.
It's really his grandfather who
inspired him to save up and buy
this well a few years ago.
It taps into this vast reserve
of oil that is deep under the
ground underneath Oklahoma and
Kansas. It's about a half mile
down. It's called the
Mississippian layer.
And basically this pump unit
plunges a metal rod into that
layer. And then with each
stroke, it pulls out a little
bit of oil.
In its day, this well might have
been a gusher, but now it only
produces a barrel or two of oil
a day.
And that's probably why Jason
was the sole person willing to
sell us oil, because these
wells are known as stripper
wells. They're operated by
independent guys like Jason who
are trying to make just a
little bit of money before
the oil runs dry.
This one may stop at any time.
The most majority of the
Mississippian crude has
already been burnt in your
car, yes.
So this is like the bottom,
the bottom of the milkshake?
Yeah, the tail end, the
bottom of the milkshake.
I like that.
Got to suck that much harder.
You got to work harder to get
it out of the ground.
It's all in pipes, but since
we are here to buy oil, like
we want to see the oil.
Yeah, we want to see the
bottom of the milkshake.
So he turns this little
tiny faucet on the side,
puts a bucket underneath and
outpours a lot of water,
which is what's in the
ground, and a little bit of
oil.
Oh my gosh.
It is the color of coffee.
Yeah, it looks like a good
latte.
Can we touch it?
Is that cool?
Yeah, you can.
Oh, it's cool.
Oh, that feels really weird.
This is our oil, right?
Right now it's my oil,
but it's going to be your
oil.
I thought this was like
handshake country.
Oh yeah, it is, but we
haven't shook hands yet.
Jason seems to remember that
this is an actual oil deal,
and so he switches into this
salesman mode.
He is super proud of his oil.
All oil, he says, is not the
same.
Some of it is dirty and
gunky, but look at my stuff.
It's sweet oil.
It's good oil.
It's light oil.
It's not thick.
It's not heavy crude.
It's the sweet crude,
what people want.
Like Saudi Arabian oil good?
No, no.
I'm not sure about Saudi
Arabian oil, but it's good
for these parts of the
world.
He's super into it.
He takes us over to see the
tank, which is this huge
black cylinder about twice
our height, and he says,
take a look inside.
Oh, that's deep.
Can you yell something down
there?
Hello?
I don't know.
It looked okay to me.
It looked okay to me, too.
He says it's sweet oil,
which means it's pretty
valuable.
It doesn't have to be
processed very much to turn
into gasoline.
And Jason owns this well
with a partner.
They paid $60,000 for it.
And right now it's actually
turning a profit of about
$15,000 a year.
It's a great business,
unless the oil runs out or
your pump breaks down or
you lose a finger or you're
struck by lightning.
Or the price goes down.
Over the last few years,
Jason has watched the price
of oil go crazy.
It's spiked, it's plunged.
And a lot of that has been
because of fracking, which
has flooded the market with
American oil.
And Jason said it is getting
harder and harder to
justify owning these oil
wells.
There's times I've thought
about getting out of it,
but then you can't sell it
for nothing.
It's not worth anything.
You know, it's not worth
the value it was.
So you think, well, I'll
just get through a little
further and get down the
road a little longer and
the price will come up.
And if I want to sell,
don't sell when it's low.
We know that.
You got to sell when it's
high.
Well, then the oil comes
back up and you think, man,
things are good.
And why would I sell now?
We're making money.
Everything's going good.
And so you just on that
roller coaster, you just,
you know, stay on or get off.
And I've stayed on.
So which sounds good to me.
Let's get on the
roller coaster.
Let's negotiate the price
for our 100 barrels of oil.
And we actually thought
this would be pretty easy.
I mean, after all,
there is a global price
for oil.
You hear about it on
the news all the time.
It's not a secret.
And in fact, while we were
driving over to Jason's
well, we heard on the radio
that the price of oil was going down
and we were excited.
We thought this is good for us.
This is a good time to buy oil.
We are going to make money.
But when you actually
get out to the oil patch
and you try and do
a deal like this,
you realize that there are
all of these slightly
different prices
that people are paying for oil.
Jason pulls out a smartphone,
starts to look at it.
It takes a while down here.
We're in bad reception.
There we go.
Now to pull up.
Then we can see here
all the prices.
So Kansas
Commons, South Central Kansas,
Eastern Kansas, Nebraska.
Every place has a different price
and some of them
are really different.
So, for instance,
Kansas Common costs
around thirty three dollars a barrel.
Wyoming Suite costs
six dollars less than that.
But of course,
Jason isn't pointing
to the cheap one.
He is pointing to the most
expensive column,
the one at the top.
Oklahoma Suite.
That's our column right now.
The average on Oklahoma
Suite is forty one dollars
and eighty three cents for the month.
I thought it was Kansas Suite, though.
Yeah, we are in Kansas.
Yeah, we are in Kansas.
Why should we pay
Oklahoma Suite prices?
Because that's what the other
oil trucks that will come,
if you don't get it, will pay me.
It's at this moment that I realize
that we do not have a lot
of negotiating power
since he's the only person
who will sell to us
in all of Kansas.
We're starting to get a little worried
and kind of give each other
these looks.
And Jason kind of steps in
and starts explaining like,
no, no, no, you don't understand.
Actually, my oil is worth more
than your typical Kansas Suite
because I'm so close
to the border with Oklahoma.
The more southern Kansas you are,
the sweeter your crude is,
the more they pay.
So it's like location,
location, location.
Yeah.
A huge part of the cost of oil
is transporting it.
And the cheapest way
to transport oil is by pipeline.
So basically, if your oil
is close to a pipeline,
you get a higher price for your oil.
And Oklahoma is the pipeline
capital of the United States.
And Jason points out his oil
well is only about a five minute drive
to the Oklahoma border.
OK, so that seems legit.
But I pull out my phone.
I check oil prices are dropping
as we are doing this negotiation.
Yeah, forty one dollars
and eighty three cents seems high.
It's in a dip.
It's on the way down.
It's headed.
It's headed.
So you're thinking like forty one
eighty, probably.
Well, you just knocked three cents.
He's knocked three cents off.
I feel you.
I mean, that's kind of
what I was thinking.
I mean, it's probably.
I mean, the deal like you buy lunch.
I will definitely buy lunch
if you get it for forty one dollars.
Forty one dollars by my lunch.
Yeah.
Well, wait, wait, wait.
You know, OK, if this is an oil deal,
I have to say I did not picture
like two guys on cell phones.
This is making me a little sad.
I wanted like, I don't know,
like spitting in the dirt or something.
Like, I don't know, fist fight.
This is my first time doing a negotiation,
so I am trying hard at this point.
I'm sorry, Robert.
It just came into my head.
Now, to be fair, oil deals are almost
never done this way anymore in person.
Normally the bids are at computers.
There's long term contracts,
but doing it in person did give us
one more card that we could play.
It still still seems a little bit expensive,
so I'm going to show you something here
that might help you change your mind,
maybe lower it a little bit.
Oh, yeah, cash money.
Yeah.
Jason is beaming now,
and he tells us that there are
some less than ethical folks out here
who would give us a pretty big cash discount.
Because they wouldn't have to report
their profits on their taxes,
and Jason swears, oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm not that kind of person.
But he says he will budge a little.
If we do it in cash,
can we get like, you know, 40?
Go down to 40.
40?
Yeah, I'd probably do that.
Let's do the handshake.
All right.
All right, deal.
That was like a $4,000 handshake.
Let me see.
Not that I don't trust you,
but let me count this.
This will be all right.
They're new.
They're like new bells.
Well, thank you, sir.
The deal's done.
Jason does not get all the money.
He has a business partner
who owns a share of the well.
Also, the farmer whose land
the well is on gets a cut.
And there will be paperwork.
There will be lots of paperwork.
But a handshake is a handshake.
So, wait, do we officially own the oil now?
You officially own the oil now.
100 barrels of the oil.
Robert Smith.
We did it.
We bought oil.
High five.
The curse is reversed.
Well, assuming, of course,
that the ground eventually dries out
and the oil truck can eventually get in
to get our oil out of the tank.
It will be a very short series if we don't.
Coming up on the next Planet Money,
we got the oil.
Now we got to transport it, refine it,
set our price, and sell it.
Let us know what you thought of today's show
or if you'd like to buy some oil.
We have 100 barrels of it.
You can email us,
planetmoney at npr.org
or you can find us on Facebook or Twitter.
We are at Planet Money.
Robert, we got to go out
and do this fun deal in the field.
That was the best part of this.
It was really fun.
But there were many, many months of work
and toil and phone calls that went into this.
And most of those were done by
Alex Goldmark, our senior producer,
and Jess Jang, our producer,
also Nick Fountain,
who, incidentally, produced today's show.

Thanks for listening.
If you could sign this just as a receipt
that I handed you that money.
Okay.
This is on, like, a reporter's notebook.
I mean, I figured, like,
I'm good on a handshake,
but NPR is going to want to see something.
That's a very nice signature.
You're getting it right, plus lunch.
I like that you're focused on lunch.
I'm also focused on lunch.
Yeah, I'm getting dry.
I'm kind of parched here.
Is there, like, a typical lunch place
that you go to after an oil deal?
Mmm, a close one.
