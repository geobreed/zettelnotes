Last of five episodes. We follow the Planet Money oil to a gas station. And we ask: What would our world look like if there were no fossil fuels?

On today's show, we follow the Planet Money oil to the end of the line.

And we ask: What would the world be like if fossil fuels did not exist? What if you dug down in the ground and there was nothing but dirt and rock.

Oil, coal and natural gas are this incredible store of energy, just sitting there in the ground waiting for us to dig them up. Amazing boon to humanity! But also: Climate change!

Would a world without oil be better? Worse? Or just different?

This is the last of five episodes about buying oil.

Find the rest of the five part series here. And some photos here.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

All right. Where are we again?

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

We're between Waterville and Blue Rapids.

SMITH: And just to recap the folks at home...

VANEK SMITH: Yeah.

SMITH: ...What happened in previous episodes of PLANET MONEY? Go.

VANEK SMITH: OK. We purchased oil from Jason Bruns in Kansas.

SMITH: We bought a hundred barrels. We transported it to a pipeline. The pipeline went to the refinery. The refinery turned it into diesel.

VANEK SMITH: Yes.

SMITH: And then it sent it across Kansas. And so what we are is in the middle of Kansas, in the middle of cornfields, looking for our pipeline.

VANEK SMITH: Hi, this is Stacey Vanek Smith.

SMITH: And I am Robert Smith. This is it. This is the last episode about our oil's journey, which is now PLANET MONEY diesel. And we're going to follow it all the way to Council Bluffs, Iowa.

VANEK SMITH: And into somebody's actual car.

SMITH: But right now, we're on the side of the road, staring out at cornfields, looking for little, tiny signs telling us where our diesel is at this moment.

VANEK SMITH: OK. We're...

SMITH: So can you read any of those? I'm not going down there.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, wait, OK, warning - underground cable. That's not it.

SMITH: Following the oil pipeline is a lot harder than it sounds because pipelines travel in a straight line and roads do not. So we spent a lot of time driving north, south, east, west, trying to intersect with a pipeline, looking for one thing.

Wait, wait, wait, right, right, right, right, right.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, I see it. I see it. Good eyes, Robert Smith.

SMITH: And so we become the only tourist in the history of Kansas to go down to take a picture of this little sign.

VANEK SMITH: Warning - petroleum pipeline. There's a tiny oil derrick on it.

SMITH: Oh, yeah. And it's a, like, a bright yellow sign, and, of course, there's lightning in the distance.

VANEK SMITH: Yes.

SMITH: Always nice to see when you're following a pipeline. But what it means is that somewhere under our feet at this moment is the PLANET MONEY diesel fuel somewhere in this tube.

VANEK SMITH: Along with a whole bunch of other stuff.

SMITH: Yeah. This is a question a lot of people have asked, which is like, wait, what? Is the PLANET MONEY oil just mixed in with everybody else's stuff? And the answer is sort of yes and no. Pipelines do not just carry one kind of product. This totally blew my mind. They can send a batch of airline fuel. For a couple of hours, they're feeding nothing but airline fuel. And then right behind it, they can do a batch of diesel, and then they could put a batch of regular gas. They're all sort of right next to each other like train cars.

VANEK SMITH: And it all ends up at a tank farm in Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is basically a whole bunch of tanks in a field. And...

SMITH: It's lovely.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) This is where the gas gets stored and delivered to customers. And here we meet Larry Bose (ph). He is a pumper gauger with CHS, Inc. That is the company that refined our oil.

SMITH: And what that means is that Larry gets a sheet of paper that tells him when the different kinds of petroleum fuel arrive, and he diverts it to the correct tank. So it says basically on the list when PLANET MONEY's diesel is going to arrive.

LARRY BOSE: About 4 o'clock in the morning, we're going to get a batch changed to diesel in here. And when it does, it's going to set off an alarm here.

SMITH: Do you have to press a button to do that?

BOSE: Nope, I'm going to run right out here and open one valve to a tank and close the other valve.

SMITH: No, no, no, no, no, no, no (laughter) you're manually going to, like, turn a wheel.

VANEK SMITH: Does it take a lot of, like, elbow grease to turn it?

BOSE: No, I think you could do it.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

BOSE: I'm serious.

VANEK SMITH: Apparently, very easy to turn, that valve.

SMITH: And, you know, I nominate you, Stacey, to stay up till 4 in the morning to get the sound of the (imitating squeaking valve).

VANEK SMITH: No, he only thinks I could do it. He's not sure. I think we need some serious PLANET MONEY brawn, Robert. Only you can bring that. I'm not getting up at 4 in the morning.

SMITH: We both went to sleep. The next morning, we tried to think, like, where would the PLANET MONEY fuel end up eventually? It's probably in a tank the next morning if it came in at 4 in the morning. But we do know that these diesel tanks feed the Cenex brand gas stations. So we went to a Cenex brand gas station only a few miles from where the pipeline ended.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, hey, are you getting gas today?

TOM: I am.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, hi.

We got to the Cenex station, and we descended on this man Tom. He is a math teacher in Council Bluffs, and he was trying to fill up his car.

SMITH: Do you know where this oil comes from?

TOM: Well, I guess my initial assumption would be Saudi Arabia possibly, somebody, you know, one of the countries that produce oil and ship to the United States I guess.

SMITH: You don't think about it very much (laughter).

TOM: Not really. I prefer it to be from the United States someplace, but, no, I guess I don't, so let me...

VANEK SMITH: Actually, this oil came from Kansas.

TOM: Oh, it did. OK.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah.

TOM: Came from Kansas, OK. Well, that's great.

VANEK SMITH: We were so excited to talk to Tom. We were so excited to talk.

SMITH: We - it's hard to explain to someone this entire project in the two minutes that he's filling up his tank, but we tried.

VANEK SMITH: Well, you bought our oil, I think, so we wanted to, like, shake your hand and...

TOM: OK, do I get something for it or...

VANEK SMITH: You get 14.5 gallons (laughter)...

TOM: Free?

VANEK SMITH: ...Of premium Kansas wheat.

TOM: Oh, OK, all right...

SMITH: No, we have to make our money back, so we have to charge you.

TOM: All right. OK.

SMITH: And so I took his money.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He paid the Cenex. The Cenex paid CHS, the refiners. The refiners paid the middleman. The middleman paid us. And we paid Jason - is that the way it works?

VANEK SMITH: Yeah.

SMITH: Something like that.

VANEK SMITH: We only lost $800.

SMITH: (Laughter) Exactly. We should've just sold it straight to him and tried to recoup our investment.

But we did not. We thought he would just be delighted with the story. But there is this problem with doing this whole oil and gas series, and that is that the end of it is so mundane - filling up the tank in your car. You don't even think about it. It just sits there. It's the most boring thing in the world. And every time we tried to tell people look at the miracle, really a miracle that just happened, that some plankton laid down their lives millions of years ago and just waited in the ground for PLANET MONEY to come along and pull it out, transforming it in just a couple of days from this prehistoric stew, really, in Kansas to driving a car in Iowa. It is a miracle.

VANEK SMITH: Yes, it is a miracle. And for all the problems that oil causes - and it causes some pretty big problems - it's a pretty miraculous substance. In fact, trying to imagine a world without oil is almost impossible because not only is there oil in the tank of Tom's car, there's also oil in the plastic in Tom's car. It's in his shoes. It's in his jacket. It's in his cellphone.

SMITH: Now that we've come to the end of our brief and very unprofitable journey through the oil business, we wanted to take a step back. Today on the show, David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein ask a simple and pretty profound question - what would the world be like without oil?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Jacob, when we started doing this series on oil, there was one morning where I came into the office and I said to you, have you ever thought how amazing it is that there was just this huge source of fuel and energy right beneath our feet? The more and more I thought about it, the more I felt like I don't know where we would be without it. I don't - could we have built this world that we live in today without fossil fuels? Because it does seem like this gift just from an energy perspective.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

Yeah. I had definitely never thought about it that way. I mean, to be honest, I'd never really thought about it at all, but when you say the phrase fossil fuel, my emotional reaction is negative. You know, I think - I think pollution. I think climate change. And so - I don't know - if I think, what would the world be like if we had never had fossil fuels? I don't know. Maybe we'd be better off if we didn't have them. You know, what we are now minus the climate change.

KESTENBAUM: When I was looking for people to help us think through this, I sort of got two categories of responses. One was like, no, thank you. I'm a serious historian. I do not do speculative alternative histories. But the other response was that is a totally fascinating question.

GOLDSTEIN: That is the correct response. And we talked to two people in particular.

DAVID KEITH: I'm David Keith. I'm a professor of - whatever it's called.

KESTENBAUM: It's called applied physics at Harvard, also public policy.

GOLDSTEIN: Here's the second person we talked to, and for some reason, the can you introduce yourself portion of the interview was causing some problems.

Can you introduce yourself?

JOEL MOKYR: To whom?

GOLDSTEIN: To everybody who's listening to PLANET MONEY.

MOKYR: Yeah, I can do that (laughter). I'm Joel Mokyr. I'm a professor of economics and history at Northwestern University.

KESTENBAUM: David and Joel come at this question from different directions. David is a scientist, kind of an energy nerd, thinks about fossil fuels a lot.

KEITH: On the one hand, I've worked on climate change for half my life, so I've been fighting the fossil fuel world forever. So in some ways, I do see it as the enemy, but also I know how the energy system works, and so I don't fool myself.

KESTENBAUM: Fossil fuels, he says, they are an amazing source of energy.

GOLDSTEIN: So David is a scientist. Joel Mokyr, on the other hand, he thinks about the the great sweep of history.

KESTENBAUM: So to set the stage, we said, OK, historian, tell us what life was like before people really started using fossil fuels in, like, the 1700s. His answer - not good.

MOKYR: Terrible, lots of hard work, back-breaking work, always a danger of not having enough to eat, threat of famine looming over one's life every day, infant mortality that was reaching, you know, 300 or 350 per thousand.

KESTENBAUM: Does that mean a third of all newborns die?

MOKYR: A third of all newborns died in infancy or before the age of 1, yes, there about.

KESTENBAUM: You can look at this and say, what we needed was science, but you could also see this as an energy problem. You want some source of energy to cook food or heat your house? Basically, you got trees. You cut down a tree, chop it up, burn the wood. We were just living off the surface of the Earth.

GOLDSTEIN: David Keith, the scientist, he says trees are not that great as far as sources of energy go. For one thing, trees are kind of spread out. You know, like, there's a tree here, then you've got to go 10 feet to the next one. And for another thing, he says, when you cut a tree down, you've got to wait, you know, a hundred years for another one to grow again.

KESTENBAUM: He says, compare that to coal.

KEITH: Coal comes in these huge, thick seams where you can just dig it out by the ton. Individual people with hoes can dig it out by the ton, and that gives you this concentrated source of energy that's geographically concentrated.

KESTENBAUM: So coal is sort of like millions of years of wood that was just stacked in the basement there for us.

KEITH: Well, in fact, it's not sort of like millions of years of wood that's stacked in the basement. That's essentially literally what it is.

KESTENBAUM: Jacob, my favorite slang for oil is dinosaur juice. It's just not true, though (laughter). Like, there may be an atom of dinosaur in oil, but it's mostly...

GOLDSTEIN: Ferns.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: I mean, there's an atom of dinosaur in anything. Like, there's an atom of dinosaur in you.

KESTENBAUM: I'm, like, 50 percent dinosaur, one of the small ones that runs really fast away from everything.

GOLDSTEIN: Fight or flight - easy call.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) So given all this, we asked them both the question - where would we be today if there had been no fossil fuels in the ground? Like, how would history have unfolded? Basically, would we have been screwed?

GOLDSTEIN: The way we did it is we ran through some key historic moments and asked both of them how things might have gone in this parallel universe where fossil fuels did not exist.

KESTENBAUM: One of the first really big moments for fossil fuels comes in the 1800s - trains, railroads, you know, coal-powered steam engines pulling all these people and all this stuff across the country. And maybe you're like, trains - snore.

GOLDSTEIN: Obviously, I am not like that, right? Like, trains are clearly a huge moment, like, the moment when the modern world comes charging at us. You know, for the first time, you can travel over land faster than a horse. This is a huge breakthrough.

KESTENBAUM: Could you have railroads if you didn't have fossil fuels? Like, what would have happened?

KEITH: Absolutely. America only became more than half fossil-fueled roughly in 1900. Before that, we had an enormous input of wind-powered energy. If you think about the big steam engines moving across western North America, a lot of those were powered by wood, not by coal.

KESTENBAUM: Oh, and some of them were running off wood.

KEITH: Most of them were running off wood. Wood was a dominant fuel.

KESTENBAUM: If you powered the railroads off wood, aren't you going to cut down an enormous number of trees?

KEITH: We cut - we cut down, like, 97 percent of the original forest in the lower 48 United States. We basically got it all.

KESTENBAUM: So we were going to run into some limits there.

KEITH: No kidding.

GOLDSTEIN: That clearly sounds very bad. But Joel Mokyr said, you know, think about the economics here. In this parallel universe where there is no fossil fuel, wood would have been really precious, really expensive. And so you would have had lots of people getting into the wood business, growing new trees to sell the wood.

KESTENBAUM: And he says, thinking about railroads, there were alternatives. Like, we could've relied more on rivers, you know, maybe would've built a bunch of canals all over the place. Economists have actually studied what would have happened without railroads, he says. It's not that bad. Getting around is a little slower, and it costs a little more.

MOKYR: Turns out, it is more expensive as every - but not so much more that we would have had completely to - we would have remained some kind of medieval economy. We would have been a different economy with much more canals.

KESTENBAUM: Right. What would have powered the boats on the canal?

MOKYR: Well, the way they always would. We would've...

KESTENBAUM: Horses pulling them.

MOKYR: ...With horses. That's how - that's how canals - that's how canal barges always been...

KESTENBAUM: That sounds bad.

MOKYR: No. It doesn't. It's a little bit slower, but it is - you know, what's the value of time?

KESTENBAUM: For those of you who don't know, the horses were not swimming pulling the barges. They were alongside pulling the barges through the canal.

GOLDSTEIN: Mokyr says, look, there were lots of other paths that we could have gone down. And yeah, I mean, some of them seem a little bit weird, but that's just because we're locked into thinking about the world as it is.

KESTENBAUM: OK, so trains that run on wood, we've got more canals. I can see that world. I can see how you could get by with that. But it leaves out this big thing, right? Electricity. What - how do you do electricity?

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that really feels like the big one, right, like, the center of this whole thing. And it comes along just not that long after trains take off. 1882 - Thomas Edison builds the first central electric power station...

KESTENBAUM: Right here in Manhattan.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, it's a few miles from where we are. It gives 82 people electric lights. It is the beginning of electrification. And, of course, Edison's power plant ran on coal. And, you know, how else would you have run that power plant?

MOKYR: We would have had to generate much more electricity from water.

KESTENBAUM: Would you have run it off - what? - the Hudson River or something or is that...

MOKYR: Yeah, we would've had to build dams on the Hudson River to run electricity. We could have generated inways that were never seriously tried, like tidal mills.

KESTENBAUM: Tidal mills - what are tidal mills?

MOKYR: Tidal mills are mills that were actually used (laughter) in the Middle Ages. They used the movement of water through the tides. And so the mill's stuck in coastal waters, and it's moved in one direction when the tide is in and it moves in the other direction when the tide is out. That creates power.

KESTENBAUM: So it's like lunar power.

MOKYR: It's essentially lunar power, yes.

GOLDSTEIN: Kestenbaum, I actually believed in this idea as he was explaining it. OK, the tide comes in and out. But then you called it lunar power. And it's like, oh, this is just some hippie dream.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) All right. Say you got lunar power, right? Still, what are you going to do about cars?

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that's, like, the next big one, right? It's just a few decades after Edison. Henry Ford comes along. What's Henry Ford going to do if there's no gasoline?

KESTENBAUM: Two words - electric cars.

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, "JAY LENO COMPARES NEW AND 100-YEAR-OLD ELECTRIC CARS")

JAY LENO: I've got an electric car. It's quite advanced. It goes 100 miles on a charge, and it was built in 1989.

KESTENBAUM: That's the Baker Electric. It's an electric car from, like, the early 1990s.

GOLDSTEIN: It's Jay Leno in this YouTube video driving around in this old car. It looks like - I don't know - like just a box on wheels.

KESTENBAUM: Doesn't it look like what Cinderella took to the prom?

GOLDSTEIN: Oh, yeah, the horseless carriage. It's the horseless carriage.

KESTENBAUM: It's, like, quite elegant. It's, like, for a queen.

GOLDSTEIN: It was not prom, for the record.

KESTENBAUM: I know, but, like, electric cars were a thing back then. Henry Ford's wife, she drove an electric car. She liked it better than her husband's invention that ran off gasoline.

GOLDSTEIN: There is a problem with electric cars. Even today, there's a problem. They just don't go that far.

KESTENBAUM: Even with modern batteries. We asked Joel Mokyr about that.

MOKYR: Battery technology turns out to be a difficult but, you know, imagine a world in which, you know - we're not terribly good at building batteries so each battery only lasts - I don't know - 40 miles. OK. Well, then we would have had to build a network in which every 40 mile you stop your car, you loosen two screws, take out the old battery, put in a freshly loaded one and keep, you know, tugging along. Yeah, that would have been a bit of a hassle but, you know, lots of things are hassles.

KESTENBAUM: All right, what about this one - airplanes. How do you do airplanes, my friend?

MOKYR: You don't.

KESTENBAUM: Not for a while anyway. Again, though, he says not a disaster. You know, you can still take a boat across the ocean and maybe there would be blimps.

MOKYR: You know, we did, for a while, experiment with a technology that actually, you know, worked reasonably well. And those were dirigibles.

KESTENBAUM: Blimps - you and Joel bonded for a while over blimps.

GOLDSTEIN: You know, the Empire State Building, the tower was built as a docking place for blimps, which I love. Like, when I'm flying into JFK and, like, I got to get a car and it takes me, like, an hour to get wherever I'm going, imagine, like, what if my blimp could just dock at the Empire State Building?

MOKYR: I know. Doesn't it sound fantastic? And not only that, but there's no noise. In many ways, it's an extremely pleasant way of traveling.

KESTENBAUM: Can I ask you a totally random one? Would we have gone to the moon?

MOKYR: I don't know. Probably not. So what?

KESTENBAUM: Talking to Joel, I actually kind of came around a bit to his side. Like, maybe things would be fine if there had been no fossil fuels. You got lots more dams, hydropower, which you're going to need for your electric cars. And Joel says, you know, because energy would be more scarce and more expensive, we would just conserve more. We'd build smaller houses that would be closer together. And, you know, OK, you want to go to Europe. You just get on a boat. It takes a week. It's OK.

GOLDSTEIN: Or a blimp. You hate blimps.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: You don't believe it. I believe it. So, OK, that's what Mokyr left us with. Then we talked to David Keith, the physicist, and he - frankly, he's less optimistic than Joel.

KESTENBAUM: Because he'd done the math on a lot of these things. Like, when we asked him, if we dam all the rivers, how much electricity does it actually get us?

KEITH: If you dam - do you want the terawatt units?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, yeah.

KEITH: If you dam all the rivers in the world, you get a few terawatts. And currently, humanity uses like 16 or 18 terawatts. So all the rivers in the world are only maybe a quarter of the total energy we're using today.

KESTENBAUM: And David Keith raised this problem that I had not even thought of - what are you going to build those dams out of - concrete? Steel? Both of those things require a lot of energy to make. Like, you know how we make steel? In a very, very hot furnace heated by fossil fuels. And by the way, thinking about trains, he said, sure, you could run the trains on wood, but how are you going to build the tracks and the train? What are you going to make those out of?

GOLDSTEIN: And on top of that, all these - all these advances we're talking about come from scientific knowledge. And we got that scientific knowledge in part because of fossil fuels because we had all this easy energy that let us advance to a place where there were people, scientists and engineers, who had time to sit around and tinker and figure things out.

KESTENBAUM: Even wind power, he says.

KEITH: Wind power does get you tens of terawatts. You could power all of modern civilization on wind power. But the question is, could you build modern wind turbines without the kind of fossil-fueled economy to get you started? Because modern wind turbines are fantastic things - huge, steel shaft, you know, almost 100-meter long blades made out of fiberglass, beautifully shaped.

KESTENBAUM: But can you build something that's just good enough, you know, to get you the...

KEITH: Maybe.

KESTENBAUM: ...Electricity you needed back in the 1800s to do whatever the next step was?

KEITH: Maybe. If the central question is, could we have tunneled through from an old biofuel-based civilization to a post-fossil civilization like we now want to get to without fossil, and if we could tunnel through, what would be the best way, it might be that a gradual development of wind power is it. Wind power you can just keep incrementally doing better. After all, we've had wind machines for a thousand years.

GOLDSTEIN: In a way, the question we've been asking for this whole show, you know, how would history have unfolded without fossil fuels, it boils down to something really simple. Are we where we are today because we're lucky or because we're smart?

KESTENBAUM: We asked Joel and David both where they stood on that. Joel Mokyr told us that based on his entire career, his life's work as a historian, he thinks we are where we are because we're smart.

MOKYR: What's driving modern history is not fuel or fossil fuel or oil. What is driving it is human ingenuity, and, you know, human ingenuity would've come up with an alternative set of solutions. And they would not have been, I think, noticeably worse than the one we ended up with. And in some ways, perhaps better. That's my position.

KESTENBAUM: David Keith, our scientist, started out sounding very similar.

KEITH: As much as I'm an energy geek and I think all about energy, the ultimate power source is people working collaboratively to figure stuff out. That's where technology comes from.

KESTENBAUM: Oh, come on.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter).

KEITH: It is. It is. That's not bullshit. It's true.

GOLDSTEIN: That's such a cheesy thing for a scientist to say.

KEITH: It's cheesy, but it's true.

KESTENBAUM: After David Keith was done praising humanity for our incredible ability to work together and be innovative, he then went on to say that he thought fossil fuels had really helped us.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, I mean, he said, sure, eventually we would have gotten to a world something like the world we live in today. But it would have taken longer. Things would have gone more slowly.

KESTENBAUM: How much slower?

KEITH: My instinct is, like, 10 times slower, much slower is my off the cuff. You know, this is total speculation.

KESTENBAUM: Wow, that's a big deal.

KEITH: Yeah. No, I mean, it's - I mean, getting access to fossil fuels is such a game changer.

GOLDSTEIN: So it would have taken hundreds more years to get to where we are now.

KEITH: Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: Fair enough.

KESTENBAUM: The truth is, we do live in a world with fossil fuels. And David Keith says fossil fuels have given us a lot. In fact, they've brought us to a point where we now have the technology to live without fossil fuels. There are a lot of detailed questions about how you'd do it, and it would take some time, but you could get rid of fossil fuels. And he said the world would look basically the same.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: David and Jacob, that is a lovely way to end the oil series. But there was one part of the journey that Stacey and I wanted to share with you before this is over. And it's a part that Stacey didn't talk about very much because she was somewhat embarrassed by.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, yeah.

SMITH: Every single time we interviewed someone, Stacey had a very unusual line of questioning. So, for instance, she was talking this guy Vince Bengston who works at the refinery, and she tried to link our oil with a certain delicious ice cream treat.

VANEK SMITH: So is there corn around here?

VINCE BENGSTON: Yes.

VANEK SMITH: So feed corn.

BENGSTON: Feed corn as in cattle feed corn is what you're referring to? A lot of it's crushed for cattle food, yes.

VANEK SMITH: So if we, like, drink a milkshake, would that potentially be a cow that was fed with feed corn that was fertilized with our oil?

BENGSTON: Yeah, yes.

VANEK SMITH: So we could drink our oil in a milkshake.

BENGSTON: Yeah.

SMITH: Every single time.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) OK. The milkshake obsession - this is from a very iconic scene in a great movie about American oil called "There Will Be Blood." And in the scene, Daniel Day Lewis is explaining how he can steal his neighbor's oil.

SMITH: With basically a giant straw.

VANEK SMITH: It's an amazing scene.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THERE WILL BE BLOOD")

DANIEL DAY-LEWIS: (As Daniel Plainview) I drink your milkshake. I drink it up.

PAUL DANO: (As Eli Sunday) Don't bully me, Daniel.

VANEK SMITH: And then he beats him to death with a bowling pin, I think.

SMITH: (Laughter) I tried to explain to you, Stacey, that this is a metaphor, but you were very insistent that we show up at a Dairy Queen in Council Bluffs and try and drink our own milkshake.

VANEK SMITH: They're making fun of me, but you know that this is exactly where the oil should end, right?

SMITH: (Laughter) Yes, it should end with me drinking your milkshake.

VANEK SMITH: No, it should end with me drinking your milkshake.

SMITH: Three, two, one, go.

(SOUNDBITE OF SLURPING)

VANEK SMITH: Are we in a contest because there are...

SMITH: No, no, it's not a contest.

VANEK SMITH: ...Like, 14 ounces of this.

SMITH: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF SLURPING)

VANEK SMITH: It's so good.

SMITH: This is going to take a while, so we're going to toss it back to David and Jacob for the end of the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: Let us know what you think. You can send us email. We are planetmoney@npr.org.

GOLDSTEIN: Or you can find us on Twitter or Facebook. The show today was produced by Jess Jiang and Nick Fountain. Jiang did the meat. Fountain did the bread. Also this week, we are doing a brief survey to learn more about you, to learn more about who is listening to PLANET MONEY. You can take it at npr.org/planetmoneysurvey. It would be a big favor to us if you could do Kestenbaum, this is it.

KESTENBAUM: Don't say it.

GOLDSTEIN: We got to do it now. This is the end.

KESTENBAUM: The end of my time at PLANET MONEY.

GOLDSTEIN: You're leaving PLANET MONEY. You got a job at "This American Life" - mazel tov.

KESTENBAUM: I'm going to call you every five minutes. I'm going to miss this place. I'm going to miss all you guys.

GOLDSTEIN: I - the thing I want to say is thank you. I always wanted to have a mentor, and I never had one. And now that you're leaving, I realize it was you. You taught me how to do this.

KESTENBAUM: Thank you. It's so not true. You know, I mean...

GOLDSTEIN: When came here, I didn't know how to make podcasts. I worked with you, and now I know how to make a podcast.

KESTENBAUM: You know that's not proof.

GOLDSTEIN: It's causal.

KESTENBAUM: A sequence of events does not - yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: It really - I loved working with you. I really, like...

KESTENBAUM: Stop using the past tense. I love working with you. I love you, man. Cut that last part. It's just too sad.

**faster whisper:**
All right, where are we again? We're between Waterville and Blue Rapids and just to recap the folks at home
Yeah, what happened in previous episodes of Planet Money go?
Okay, we purchased oil from Jason Bruns in Kansas. We bought a hundred barrels
We transported it to a pipeline the pipeline which the refinery the refinery turned it into diesel
Yes, and then it sent it across Kansas
And so what we are is in the middle of Kansas in the middle of cornfields
Looking for a pipeline. Hi, this is Stacy Vanek Smith and I am Robert Smith. This is it
This is the last episode about our oils journey
Which is now Planet Money diesel and we're gonna follow it all the way to council Bluffs, Iowa and into somebody's actual car
But right now we're on the side of the road
Staring out at cornfields looking for little tiny signs telling us where our diesel is at this moment
Okay, so can you read any of those? I'm not going down there. Oh wait
Okay warning underground cable. That's not it
Following the oil pipeline is a lot harder than it sounds because pipelines travel in a straight line and roads do not
So we spend a lot of time driving north-south east-west trying to intersect with a pipeline looking for one thing
And so we become
The only tourist in the history of Kansas to go down to take a picture of this little sign warning petroleum pipeline
There's a tiny oil derrick on it. Oh, yeah, and it's like a bright yellow sign
And of course, there's lightning in the distance
Yes, always nice to see when you're following a pipeline
But what it means is that somewhere under our feet at this moment is the Planet Money diesel fuel?
Somewhere in this tube along with a whole bunch of other stuff
Yeah, this is a question a lot of people have asked which is like wait
What is is the Planet Money oil just mixed in with everybody else's stuff and the answer is sort of yes and no
Pipelines do not just carry one kind of product. This totally blew my mind
They can send a batch of airline fuel for a couple of hours
They're feeding nothing but airline fuel and then right behind it
They can do a batch of diesel and then they could put a batch of regular gas
They're all sort of right next to each other like train cars and it all ends up at a tank farm in
Council Bluffs, Iowa, which is basically a whole bunch of tanks in a field and lovely
This is where the gas gets stored and delivered to customers and here we meet Larry Bowes
He is a pumper gauger with CHS, Inc
That is the company that refined our oil and what that means is that Larry gets a sheet of paper that tells him
When the different kinds of petroleum fuel arrive and he diverts it to the correct tank
So it says basically on the list when Planet Money's diesel is going to arrive about four o'clock in the morning
We're gonna get a batch change the diesel in here and when it does it's gonna set off an alarm here
Do you have to press a button to do that?
No, I'm gonna run right out here and open one valve to a tank and close the other valve. No, no, no, no, no
No, you're you're manually going to like turn a wheel
Does it take a lot of like elbow grease to turn it? No, I think you could do it
I'm serious apparently very easy to turn
And you know, I know but it used AC to stay up till 4 in the morning to get the sound of the
No, he only thinks I could do it. He's not sure
I think we need some serious planet money brawn Robert only you can bring that
We both went to sleep and the next morning we tried to think like where would the planet money fuel end up eventually
It's probably in a tank the next morning if it came in at 4 in the morning
But we do know that these diesel tanks feed the Cenex brand gas stations
So we went to a Cenex brand gas station only a few miles from where the pipeline ended
We got to the Cenex station and we descended on this man Tom
He is a math teacher in council bluffs and he was trying to fill up his car
You know where this oil comes from? Well, I guess my initial assumption be Saudi Arabia
Possibly somebody, you know, one of the countries that produce oil ship the United States, I guess you don't think about it very much
not really I
Prefer to be from United States someplace. But no, I guess I don't so actually this oil came from Kansas
Oh it did. Okay. Yeah came from Kansas. Okay. Well, that's great
We were so excited to talk to Tom
We were so excited and we it's hard to explain to someone this entire project in the two minutes that he's filling up
His tank, but we tried well you bought our oil
I think so we wanted to like shake your hand and it's like it's something for her
You get fourteen point five gallons free of premium Kansas sweet. Oh, okay
No, we have to make our money back. So we have to charge you. All right, okay, and so I took his money
No, no, no, no, no, no
He paid the Cenex the Cenex paid CHS the refiners the refiners paid the middleman the middleman paid us and we paid
Jason is that the way it is? Yeah, something like that. We only lost eight hundred dollars
We should have just sold it straight to him and try to recoup our investment, but we did not we thought he would just be
delighted with the story
But there is this problem with doing this whole oil and gas series and that is that the end of it is so
Mundane filling up the tank in your car. You don't even think about it. It just sits there
It's the most boring thing in the world and every time we tried to tell people look at the miracle really a miracle
They just happened that some
Plankton laid down their lives millions of years ago and just waited in the ground for planet money to come along and pull it
Out transforming it in just a couple of days from this prehistoric stew
Really in Kansas to driving a car in Iowa. It is a miracle
Yes
It is a miracle and for all the problems that oil causes and it causes some pretty big problems
It's a pretty miraculous substance
In fact trying to imagine a world without oil is almost impossible because not only is there oil in the tank of Tom's car
There's also oil in the plastic in Tom's car. It's in his shoes. It's in his jacket
It's in his cell phone now that we've come to the end of our brief and very
Unprofitable journey through the oil business. We wanted to take a step back
Today on the show David Kestin mom and Jacob Goldstein ask a simple and pretty profound question
What would the world be like without oil?
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from our Planet Money sponsor

Jacob when we started doing this series on oil there was one morning where I came into the office and I said to you
Have you ever thought how amazing it is that there was just this huge source of fuel and energy right beneath our feet
The more and more I thought about it the more I felt like I don't know where we would be without it
I don't could we have built this world that we live in today without fossil fuels because it does seem like this gift
Just from an energy perspective. Yeah, I had definitely never thought about it that way
I mean to be honest, I'd never really thought about it at all
But when you say the phrase fossil fuel my my emotional reaction is negative, you know
I think I think pollution I think climate change and so I don't know if I think what would the world be like if
We had never had fossil fuels. I don't know. Maybe we'd be better off if we didn't have them
You know what we are now minus the climate change when I was looking for people to help us think through this
I sort of got two categories of responses. One was like no. Thank you. I'm a serious historian
I do not do speculative alternative histories, but the other response was that is a totally fascinating question
That is the correct response and we talked to two people in particular. I'm David Keith. I'm a professor of
Whatever it's called. It's called Applied Physics at Harvard also public policy
Here's the second person we talked to and for some reason the can you introduce yourself portion of the interview was causing some problems
Can you introduce yourself to whom to everybody who's listening to the plan of money? Yeah, I can do that
I'm Joel Mokir. I'm a professor of economics and history at Northwestern University
David and Joel come at this question from different directions
David is a scientist kind of an energy nerd thinks about fossil fuels a lot on the one hand
I've worked on climate change for half my life
So I've been fighting the fossil fuel world forever. So in some ways I do see it as the enemy
But also I know how the energy system works. And so I don't fool myself fossil fuels
He says they are an amazing source of energy. So David is a scientist Joel Mokir on the other hand
He thinks about the the great sweep of history
So to set the stage we said, okay historian
Tell us what life was like before people really started using fossil fuels in like the 1700s his answer not good
terrible
lots of hard work
back-breaking work and
always a danger of not having enough to eat a
threat of famine looming over
one's life every day
Infant mortality that was reaching, you know 300 or 350 per thousand
I mean a third of all newborns die a third of all newborns died in
Infancy or before the age of one. Yes there about you can look at this and say what we needed was science
But you could also see this as an energy problem
You want some source of energy to cook food or heat your house?
Basically, you got trees you cut down a tree chop it up burn the wood
We were just living off the surface of the earth David Keith the scientist
He says trees are not that great as far as sources of energy go for one thing trees are kind of spread out
You know, like there's a tree here
Then you got to go ten feet to the next one and for another thing
He says when you cut a tree down you got to wait, you know
A hundred years for another one to grow again
He says compare that to coal coal comes in these huge thick seams where you can just dig it out by the ton
Individual people with hose can dig it out by the time and that gives you this
Concentrated source of energy that's geographically concentrated
So coal is sort of like millions of years of wood that was just stacked in the basement there for us
Well, in fact, it's not sort of like millions of years of wood the stack in the basement
That's essentially literally what it is. Jacob. My favorite slang for oil is dinosaur juice
It's just not like there may be an atom of dinosaur in oil, but it's mostly
Ferns yeah, I mean there's an atom of dinosaur in anything if there's an atom of dinosaur in you
I'm like 50% dinosaur one of the small ones. It runs really fast away from everything fight or flight easy call
So given all this we asked them both the question
Where would we be today if there had been no fossil fuels in the ground?
Like how would history have unfolded?
Basically would we have been screwed?
The way we did it is we ran through some key historic moments and asked both of them how things might have gone in
this parallel universe where fossil fuels did not exist one of the first really big moments for fossil fuels comes in the
1800s trains railroads
You know coal powered steam engines pulling all these people in all this stuff across the country and maybe you're like trains snore
Obviously, I'm not like that right like trains are clearly a huge moment like the moment when the modern world comes charging at us
You know for the first time you can travel over land faster than a horse
This is a huge breakthrough could you have railroads if you didn't have fossil fuels, like what would have happened?
Absolutely
America only became more than half fossil fueled roughly in
1900 before that we had an enormous input of wood powered energy if you think about the big steam engines moving across
Western North America a lot of those were powered by wood not by coal
Oh, some of them were running off wood
Most of them were running off wood wood was a dominant fuel if you powered the railroads off wood
Aren't you gonna cut down an enormous number of trees?
We cut that we cut down like
97% of the original forest in a lower 48 United States. We basically got it all so
We were gonna run into some limits there. No kidding that clearly sounds very bad
But John Mulcair said, you know think about the economics here in this parallel universe where there's no fossil fuel
Wood would have been really precious really expensive
And so you would have lots of people getting into the wood business growing new trees to sell the wood
And he says thinking about railroads there were alternatives like we could have relied more on rivers
You know, maybe would have built a bunch of canals all of the place
Economists have actually studied what would have happened without railroads
It's not that bad getting around is a little slower and it costs a little more turns out it is more expensive as every as you
But not so much more that we would have had completely to be clear
We would have remained some kind of medieval economy
We would have been a different economy with much more canals, right? What would what would have powered the boats on the canal?
The way they always would we would have we were driving with horses. That's how that's how canals
That's how canal barges
That sounds bad. No, it doesn't it's a little bit slower
But it is you know, what's the value of time for those of you who don't know the horses?
We're not swimming pulling the barges
They were alongside pulling the barges through the canal
Mokir says look there were lots of other paths that we could have gone down and yet
I mean some of them seem a little bit weird
But that's just because we're locked into thinking about the world as it is
Okay, so trains that run on wood we got more canals. I can see that world
I can see how you could get by with that
But it leaves out this big thing right electricity. What how do you do electricity?
Yeah, that really feels like the big one right like the center of this whole thing and and it comes along
Just not that long after trains take off
1882 Thomas Edison builds the first central electric power station right here in man
Yes, it's a few miles from where we are. It gives 82 people electric lights
It is the beginning of electrification and of course Edison's power plant ran on coal and you know
How else would you have run that power plant?
We would have had to get to generate much more electricity from water
Would you have run it off what the Hudson River or something or is that yeah?
We would have had to build dams on the Hudson River to run electricity
We could have generated in ways that were never seriously tried like tidal mills tidal mills
What are tidal mills tidal mills are mills that were actually used in in the Middle Ages
they use the movement of
Water in through the tides and so the mills stuck in coastal waters
And it's moving one direction when the tide is in moving the other direction when the tide is tied out they create power
So it's like lunar power. It's essentially lunar power. Yes, I actually believed in this idea as he was explained
Okay, the tide comes down, but then you called it lunar power. It's like oh, this is just some hippie dream
All right. Say you got lunar power right still. What are you gonna do about cars? Yeah, that's like the next big one, right?
It's just a few decades after Edison Henry Ford comes along. What's Henry Ford gonna do if there's no gasoline two words electric cars
I've got an electric car
It's quite advanced goes a hundred miles on a charge
And it was built in 1909. That's the Baker electric. It's an electric car from like the early 1900s
It's Jay Leno in this YouTube video driving around in this old car
It looks like I don't know like this is a box on wheels doesn't look like what Cinderella took to the
Prom yeah, the horseless carriage the horseless. It's like quite elegant
It's like for a queen was not prom for the record
No, but like electric cars were a thing back then Henry Ford's wife. She drove an electric car
She liked it better than her husband's invention that ran off gasoline. There is a problem with electric cars. Even today
There's a problem. They just don't go that far even with modern batteries. We asked Joel Mokir about that battery technology turns out to be
difficult, but you know
Imagine imagine a world in which you know, we we were not terribly good building batteries for each battery only
Last and about 40 miles. Okay. Well, then we would have had to build a network in which every 40 mile you
Stop your car you loosen two screws take out the old battery put in a freshly loaded one and keep you know tugging along
Yeah, we had that would have been a bit of a hassle, but you know lots of things are hassles
All right. What about this one airplanes?
How do you do airplanes my friend you don't not for a while anyway again though
He says not a disaster, you know, you could still take a boat across the ocean and maybe there would be blimps
You know we did for a while
experiment with a
Technology that actually you know worked reasonably well and and and those were dirgibles
Blimps you and Joel bonded for a while over blimps
You know the Empire State Building the tower was built as a docking place for blimps
Which I love like when I'm flying into JFK and like I got to get a car and it takes me like an hour
To get wherever I'm going imagine like what if my blimp could just dock at the Empire State?
No, doesn't it sound fantastic and not only that but there is no noise in many ways
It's an extremely pleasant way of traveling. Can I ask you a totally random one? Would we have gone to the moon? I
Don't know probably not
So what?
Talking to Joel
I actually kind of came around a bit to his side like maybe things would be fine if there had been no fossil fuels
You got lots more dams hydropower
Which you're gonna need for your electric cars and Joel says, you know, because energy would be more scarce and more expensive
We would just conserve more we'd build smaller houses that would be closer together and you know, okay
You want to go to Europe? You just get on a boat. It takes a week. It's okay or a blimp. You hate blimps
I
You don't believe it. I believe it
So, okay
That's what Mokir left us with then we talked to David Keith the physicist and he frankly he's less
Optimistic than Joel because he done the math on a lot of these things like when we asked him if we damn all the rivers
How much electricity does it actually get us if you damn?
Do you want the terawatt units? Yeah. Yeah
If you damn all the rivers in the world you get a few terawatts and currently humanity uses like 16 or 18 terawatts
so all the rivers in the world are only maybe a quarter of the total energy we're using today and David Keith raised this
Problem that I had not even thought of what are you going to build those dams out of concrete steel?
Both of those things require a lot of energy to make like, you know
How we make steel in a very very hot furnace heated by fossil fuels and by the way thinking about trains
He said sure you could run the trains on wood, but how you gonna build the tracks and the train?
What are you gonna make those out of and on top of that all these all these advances we're talking about come from
scientific knowledge and we got that scientific knowledge in part because of fossil fuels because we had all this easy energy that
Let us advance to a place where there were people scientists and engineers who had time to sit around and tinker and figure things
out even wind power
He says wind power does get you tens of terawatts you could power all of modern civilization on wind power
But the question is could you build modern wind turbines without the kind of fossil-fueled economy to get you started?
Because modern wind turbines are fantastic things huge steel shaft, you know almost 100 meter long blades made out of
Fiberglass beautifully shaped but can you build something?
That's just good enough, you know to get you the electricity you needed back in the 1800s to do whatever the next step
Maybe if the if the central question is could we have tunneled through from an old biofuel based civilization?
To a post fossil civilization like we now want to get to without fossil and if we could tunnel through what would be the best
Way, it might be that a gradual development of wind power is it wind power
You can just keep incrementally doing better after all we've had wind machines for a thousand years in a way the question
We've been asking for this whole show, you know
How would history have unfolded without fossil fuels it boils down to something really simple
Are we where we are today because we're lucky or because we're smart
We asked Joel and David both where they stood on that
Joe Mulcair told us that based on his entire career his life's work as a historian
He thinks we are where we are
Because we're smart what's driving modern history is not fuel or fossil fuel or what?
What is driving it is human ingenuity and you know human ingenuity would have come up with an alternative set of solutions and
They would not have been I think
Noticeably worse than the one we ended up with and in some ways perhaps better
That's my position David Keith our scientist started out sounding very similar as much as I'm an energy geek
And I think all about energy the ultimate power sources is people working collaboratively to figure stuff out
That's where technology. Oh, come on
After David Keith was done praising humanity for our incredible ability to work together and be innovative
He then went on to say that he thought fossil fuels had really helped us
Yeah, I mean he said sure eventually we would have gotten to a world something like the world we live in today
But it would have taken longer things would have gone more slowly
How much slower my instinct is like ten times slower much slower as my off-the-cuff, you know
This is total speculation
Wow, that's a big deal. Yeah. No, I mean it's it's I mean getting access to fossil fuels is such a game-changer
So it would have taken hundreds more years to get to where we are now. Yeah
Fair enough. The truth is we do live in a world with fossil fuels and David Keith says fossil fuels have given us a lot
In fact, they've brought us to a point where we now have the technology to live without fossil fuels
There are a lot of detailed questions about how you do it and it would take some time
But you could get rid of fossil fuels and he said the world would look basically the same
David and Jacob that is a lovely way to end the oil series
But there was one part of the journey that Stacey and I wanted to share with you
Before this is over and it's a part that Stacey didn't talk about very much because she was somewhat embarrassed by
Every single time we interviewed someone Stacey had a very unusual line of questioning
So for instance, she was talking to this guy Vince Bankston who works at the refinery and she tried to link our oil
With a certain delicious ice cream treat. Is there corn around here? Yes, so feed corn
feed corn as in cattle feed corn is what you're referring to a lot of us
Crushed for cattle food. Yes, so if we like drink a milkshake
Would that potentially be a cow that was fed with feed corn that was fertilized with our oil? Yeah
Yes, we could drink our oil in a milkshake. Yeah
every single time
Okay, the milkshake obsession
This is from a very iconic scene in a great movie about American oil called there will be blood and in the scene
Daniel Day-Lewis is explaining how he can steal his neighbor's oil with basically a giant straw. It's an amazing scene. I
drink your
milkshake I
Drink it up
And then he beats him to death with a bowling pin I think I
Tried to explain to Stacey that this is a metaphor
But you were very insistent that we show up at a Dairy Queen and Council Bluffs and try and drink our own milkshake
You're making fun of me, but you know that this is exactly where the oil should end, right?
Yes, it should end with me drinking your milkshake no should end with me drinking your milkshake three two one go
Are we in a contest because no no it's not a contest 14 ounces of this
It's so good this is gonna take a while so we're gonna toss it back to David and Jacob for the end of the show
Let us know what you think you can send us email we are planet money at NPR org
Or you can find us on Twitter or Facebook the show today was produced by Jess Jang and Nick Fountain
Jang did the meat fountain did the bread
Also this week. We are doing a brief survey to learn more about you to learn more about who's listening to Planet Money
You can take it at NPR org
Planet Money survey it would be a big favor to us if you could do it
Justin Bum
This is it
Don't say it we got to do it now. This is the end the end of my time
You're leaving Planet Money you got a job at this American life mazel tov
I'm gonna call you every five minutes
I'm gonna miss this place. I'm gonna miss all you guys I
The thing I want to say is thank you. I
Always wanted to have a mentor and I never had one and now that you're leaving
I realize it was you you taught me how to do this. Thank you. It's so not true
You know, I mean I when I came here I didn't know how to make podcasts
That's I worked with you and now I know how to make you know, that's not proof. It's causal
a
Sequence of events does not yeah, it really uh, I
Loved working with you. I really like stop using the past tense. I love working with you. I love you, man
Cut that last part. It's just too sad
