Meet a single mother who makes $16,000 a year and managed to fund a vacation at a Caribbean resort with an interest-free loan from one of the world's largest banks.

Note: This podcast was originally posted in October, 2010.

Today, we meet Edith Calzado. She's a single mother and makes $16,000 a year. And she managed to fund a vacation at a Caribbean resort with an interest-free loan from one of the world's largest banks.

Edith gets credit cards with teaser zero-percent interest rates, but transfers her balance before the rate goes up. She signs up for store cards to get discounts, and then pays off her bill on time. She gets food stamps and lives in subsidized housing.

She may be the single most successful and productive beneficiary of government assistance you'll ever meet.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

Hey, it's Jacob Goldstein. Today's show is a rerun. It originally aired all the way back in 2010. It's a good one.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: Hello and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

CAITLIN KENNEY, BYLINE: And Caitlin Kenney. Today on the show, life at the poverty level. We hang out with a woman named Edith, a single mother who makes $16,000 a year and yet managed to fund a vacation at a Caribbean resort with an interest-free loan from one of the world's largest banks. She is a fascinating woman, and you are going to hear all about her.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KENNEY: This woman's name is Edith Calzado, and she is perhaps the single most successful and productive beneficiary of government transfer payments you'll ever meet. Transfer payments - think of welfare and food stamps.

BLUMBERG: Some people in the country earn more than they need to cover their basic necessities. And the government taxes those people and gives some of that money to people the government thinks don't earn enough to cover their basic necessities. Those are transfer payments.

KENNEY: And there's obviously a really contentious debate about transfer payments. One argument you hear is that transfer payments just don't make economic sense, that they punish productive work by taxing it and then reward other people for not being productive. Some people argue that it takes away the initiative to go out and get a job if you know you're going to get this money anyway. And so the argument goes that everyone just ends up poor - the rich, the poor - that these payments aren't good for anyone.

BLUMBERG: No, and this is an economic argument, not a moral argument. There is a moral argument that says it's fine if everyone is poor as long as we live in a fair society. So transfer payments make sense just on that. But there is also an economic counterargument as well, that transfer payments, if done right, actually improve the economy in the long run.

And this argument says basically, poverty itself is inefficient. Trying to keep your family fed while living at the margin, it doesn't allow you to develop your human capital. In other words, extreme poverty keeps you from getting the education you need to get a good skilled job that would help make you and the whole society at large richer.

KENNEY: Edith Calzado is the poster child for that second argument. So Alex, you and I met Edith at an antipoverty program that's run by the city. It's called a Financial Empowerment Center. And it's a place where people who live in New York and have low incomes can come in and get free financial counseling and advice. She was there having her first interview with her counselor, Michelle Murio (ph).

BLUMBERG: And at first blush, Edith seemed to be in pretty bad shape. She was a single mother. She had a restraining order against her husband, who'd abused her. And she was earning very little money, as we found out when Michelle asked Edith about her income.

MICHELLE MURIO: How much do you make, roughly, on average, a month?

EDITH CALZADO: This year I make, like, 11,000.

MURIO: No, per month.

CALZADO: Oh, per month? It's like 900.

MURIO: OK. And how much do you spend money on groceries per month? How much do you spend? You don't?

CALZADO: I don't spend.

MURIO: Because you get...

CALZADO: I get food stamps. And also there is some place - they have a food pantry.

MURIO: OK.

CALZADO: And I go there too.

MURIO: And your debt, the stuff that you think you owe out there, what do you think it is around? How much do you think you owe out there, roughly?

CALZADO: Like 2,300.

KENNEY: So initially, this was a pretty grim picture, Alex. We were just sitting here, hearing how little she makes and how much she owes. And it turns out that Edith does have other ways she makes income on the side. She cleans offices and sells baked goods around her neighborhood.

But even with this extra money, she told us she only brings in about $16,000 a year, which - this was pretty scary for me to learn - but apparently, in New York City, that is still considered above the poverty line. It's just barely above the poverty line. But making $16,000 a year puts you above the poverty line for a family of two.

BLUMBERG: And, as she said, she has $2,300 in debt. And that was credit card debt. But as she continued this counseling session, more and more emerged about Edith. And the picture started to change. So for example, she has $900 in savings. She puts away at least 20 to $30 a month. And then that debt, that credit card debt, it turns out it's all interest-free. So Edith is really good at taking those teaser rates from banks - you know, when they say 0 percent interest until January 2011 or whatever. And she milks them for all they're worth.

KENNEY: She's also really good at getting those store credit cards. You know, when you're shopping in Filene's and they're like, if you sign up today we'll give you a 10 percent discount. She would do that. She would sign up for the store card, use it for the discount and then just pay off the balance and close the card out.

BLUMBERG: Michelle, the counselor, pulled Edith's credit report. And she wouldn't tell us the number on tape. But her credit report was excellent.

MURIO: That's your credit score.

CALZADO: Oh.

MURIO: Excellent, OK? So let's go over what you got going on here. You have a Sears card that has been closed by you, zero balance, right? Chase, Toys R Us, closed, zero - GAP, closed, zero - Kohl's, zero, and it's open.

KENNEY: So Alex, you and I were sitting there listening to this. And we're thinking this is so different from that story you usually hear about the poor person who is being taken advantage of by all these credit card companies or predatory lenders who are saying hey, we'll give you all this money for a low rate. And then they end up really in debt and they don't know what to do. Edith was taking advantage of those low rates. But then she was paying them off before the companies could even charge her interest. So she was taking their money and not the other way around.

MURIO: Mandy's, zero - Citibank, closed, zero - Children's Place, zero, OK?

KENNEY: I've got to say, Alex, at this point when we're sitting there hearing this, I started to feel kind of bad about my own financial situation.

BLUMBERG: I know, me too a little bit.

KENNEY: Edith just was so savvy. And I was like, we have a lot to learn from Edith.

BLUMBERG: So we decided, let's spend some more time with her. So a couple months after meeting her at this Financial Empowerment Center, we caught up with her again and spent the day with her. And I asked her about all of those teaser-rate credit cards she had opened.

So have you ever had a - have you ever paid an interest rate on a credit card?

CALZADO: No, no way.

BLUMBERG: So you've never paid a bank fee?

CALZADO: No, no, no, no, no.

BLUMBERG: And how much money have you borrowed interest-free, do you think, over the course of your life? How much money have you borrowed...

CALZADO: In total, everything?

BLUMBERG: In total, yeah.

CALZADO: Yeah. It's, like, 13,000.

BLUMBERG: Thirteen thousand?

CALZADO: Yeah, 13,000.

BLUMBERG: So you've borrowed $13,000 from them...

CALZADO: From Citibank.

BLUMBERG: ...For free?

CALZADO: Yeah, for free.

KENNEY: All right. For those of you keeping score at home, that's Edith Calzado, $13,000, Citibank, zero.

BLUMBERG: Well, it's not exactly zero. She does pay a balance transfer fee of 3 percent.

KENNEY: All right.

BLUMBERG: But still, we looked it up. And Edith, a Dominican immigrant on food stamps, is borrowing money more cheaply than the average highly-rated U.S. corporation is. And in fact, just recently, one of these interest-free loans that she got enabled Edith to treat her son, Sammy (ph), to something he had never experienced before, a vacation at a resort in the Dominican Republic.

CALZADO: I pay $103 for my son and I, everything included, from Friday to Saturday. And you are allowed to enjoy the six hotel in the resort. This was awesome - my son say, awesome.

SAMMY: Everything was awesome.

KENNEY: Here's Edith's son, Sammy, who's 9 years old.

SAMMY: And they had four hotels. And there was, like, this little train that would pick you up. And it would take you to any of the hotels you wanted. And then we also went to Ocean World, which - where we got to play with dolphins and sea lions.

KENNEY: Wow, that sounds pretty cool.

SAMMY: Yeah, and I got to dance with a dolphin.

KENNEY: You danced with a dolphin?

SAMMY: Yeah.

KENNEY: Who's a better dancer, you or the dolphin?

SAMMY: The dolphin.

KENNEY: The dolphin?

BLUMBERG: So again, Edith got to do all of this by borrowing money interest-free. So she was able to spread out the cost of this trip into a whole bunch of different installments that she never paid any interest on. Now, the fact that Edith was able to do that as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic living at the poverty level is pretty surprising. But it's even more surprising given Edith's life story, which she shared with us during the day that we spent with her.

KENNEY: Edith explained to us that she's 1 of 12 children from a big Dominican family. She came to the U.S. in 1997, when she was in her early 30s. And she lived, along with six of her sisters and one of her brothers, in her mother's tiny, one-bedroom apartment.

CALZADO: We were living and sleeping two and three in twin bed because my mother didn't have a lot of money, you know.

BLUMBERG: So when you first got to this country, you were - there was eight of you. And you had to - there was two and three in one bed?

CALZADO: Twin.

BLUMBERG: In a twin bed?

CALZADO: Yeah. You imagine this small.

BLUMBERG: Three people in a twin bed? So in your twin bed, it was you and one other sister or two other?

CALZADO: One other sister. The other was three, and my mother was two.

BLUMBERG: How did you get to be the lucky one with only two?

CALZADO: Because my other sister is fat. And I was skinny. (Laughter). Nobody can fit in the bed. (Laughter).

BLUMBERG: It was actually this mattress situation that introduced Edith to her future abusive husband. The story is that she was over at a friend of her sister's house. And this friend was a little bit better off. And she said, hey, I have an extra mattress for you guys, you won't have to double up. Why don't you just take it? At first, Edith tried to protest. But the friend insisted.

CALZADO: She didn't give me another option - like, took my bed - went and said, oh, we have car service around here. Let me call, and they will send somebody who has a station wagon or minivan. The father of my son come.

BLUMBERG: And he was the driver?

CALZADO: He was the driver. And he's still driving by that time. How I tell you - sometime - now I'm more careful. You know, now I'm more careful. I am already almost three and a half - two and a half year no man around me, you know? I'm more careful because sometimes sweet word that sound like honey is like poisoning.

KENNEY: Edith talks to us a lot about her ex-husband, how she'd fallen for him in the beginning and how he turned on her. And she told us that he never gave her any money for her or their son. So she was forced to go around to the neighborhood food pantries and just try to put together whatever she could for her and Sammy to eat.

BLUMBERG: Even though her husband made pretty good money.

KENNEY: Yeah. She said he kept all the money for himself. Eventually, three years ago though, she did succeed in getting away from him. She got a restraining order. And her and Sammy were able to move to a different place.

BLUMBERG: And this is one of these things that I always think about, Caitlin, is that when you go to talk to somebody as a journalist or whatever, you're just meeting them at a particular moment in their life. And you don't know how their life is actually going to turn out. And so I keep thinking, like, if we had met Edith a couple of years ago when she was still with her abusive husband and working at a McDonald's, we would have thought, like, man, what is going to happen to her and, especially, what's going to happen to Sammy, her son. It seems like they're really trapped in this situation. Today, it feels very different.

KENNEY: And the reason Edith's life is so different today than what we might have pictured had we met her back then is that she's gotten a lot of help from the government. She is a huge recipient of transfer payments. We sat down with her and totaled up all the things that she's gotten over the years. And she told us that up until Sammy was 5, she got free food from the government under the WIC program. She also had her child care paid for under the New York City child welfare program.

BLUMBERG: And up until today, almost all her expenses are defrayed or paid for entirely by a government program. Food, for example, she gets food stamps. Her health insurance is covered under Medicaid. When she left her husband, her legal fees were paid for by a government program to help victims of domestic abuse. And just recently, she got off the waiting list for a subsidized apartment in a Bronx housing project. So she was paying $950 a month in rent.

KENNEY: And I remember when she told us that. And we're sitting there doing the math in our heads, being like, wait a minute. She just told us she only makes $900. Like, how is she doing this? How is she getting by?

BLUMBERG: Right, I know. It was almost all of the money that she made. And it was for a tiny apartment where she and Sammy shared a bedroom. Now she only pays $271 for a much bigger place.

CALZADO: It's wonderful. It's a - I said that God was in the middle of this blessing because I had big apartment. My son has his own bathroom - you know? I don't pay gas. I don't pay electricity. I can have my washing machine at home, you know? I can have an air-condition in all the rooms, you know? I pay less rent. This is the more important thing.

BLUMBERG: So here is the question. How should we think about all these transfer payments that Edith is getting? Now, obviously, like, you know, we liked Edith. And we're happy that she is doing better. But again, leaving aside the morality of the argument, is this a good investment? Will it pay off? And with Edith, it could go either way. She could eventually start earning a lot more money. Maybe she'll go back to school.

Maybe she'll end up, you know, earning as much money as she's received in transfer payments. But when you think about her son, Sammy, it really starts to look like a pretty good investment. If you just think about his life, without the food stamps, the WIC, the government money to pay for his child care, his life would have been much different.

KENNEY: Yeah, and my image of that life is pretty scary. You know, Alex, I recently went to Haiti with Adam. And we went into this very small village in the town of Latibonit. And we saw these families and their kids. And immediately, when they see - the first thing they say is, we're hungry. We're hungry. Do you have any food? And they're living in these really small handmade huts, one room. And the parents are just struggling to get through every day.

Sometimes they have to pull their kids out of school because they need them to work or they can't afford the school fees. And every day is just such a struggle to survive. There's no time to think about the future or education because you're just like, what am I going to feed my kid tomorrow? Like, what are we going to do if I get sick or my child gets sick?

BLUMBERG: And, you know, child development experts will tell you that, you know, if you are not getting the proper nourishment, if you're not getting the proper medical care or you're not getting the proper stimulation when you're a very little kid, you might end up with a permanent skill deficit as an adult. Like, what happens when to you when you're a little baby can have, you know, sort of long-term consequences on your future life. And of course, that has economic consequences.

The more people in a society without skills, the worse off the economy is going to be. But, of course, Sammy is sort of the opposite picture of that because of government transfer payments. He had steady food. He had a place to live - again, both provided by the government. Instead of focusing on survival, his mom was able to focus on his education. She got him into this gifted program, where he's thriving. He's in fourth grade but reading far above his grade level. He's one of those kids who already seems destined for college.

SAMMY: I'm on level U.

KENNEY: What's level U?

SAMMY: It has hard books, though.

KENNEY: What books are hard?

SAMMY: Well, sometimes, when I just feel like I want to read something harder than my level, I read levels, like, X and Z. And sometimes the level Z books are hard for me. So I go down the letters. And right now, I have an X book in my book baggie, and it looks really interesting because I read the blurb. And it's, like, very interesting.

It's about a boy that - he had a pet deer. And his family has to fight off wolves because they live in the wilderness. And they have to fight off wolves and moose and other creatures in the wild. And then one day, they have to part with the deer because they're, like, going to move to a city or something. And you don't see anybody in the city with a pet deer, so they have to part with it. And it ends it right there.

BLUMBERG: It sounds good. What's it called, do you remember?

SAMMY: "The Yearling."

KENNEY: If you're looking at Sammy, it looks like our taxpayer investment in Edith is going to pay off. Of course, there's still lots of hurdles ahead for him. But if Sammy gets a degree and a good job, he'll pay in taxes more than he has received in transfer payments.

BLUMBERG: So you would think that the way Edith thinks about transfer payments is pretty straightforward. But we talked to her about it. And it's not straightforward at all. On the one hand, she recognizes and is grateful for all the help that the government has given her. She thinks that's a good thing. But then she'll start talking about other types of transfer payments that the government is giving to people that she knows or in her community. And she can sound a little like Ronald Reagan in the '80s talking about welfare queens.

CALZADO: It's true that the government cannot control the personal life of the person. But if you say that you don't have a husband or you have three kids, why next year you come with four? Where you got the other one? It's, like, routine.

BLUMBERG: It becomes - welfare becomes a routine.

CALZADO: A routine for the people who are in there, like a routine.

BLUMBERG: As we're talking to Edith, she has a more nuanced view then your average person about transfer payments in America because obviously, she is much more in the center of it all. And because of that, I think, she actually embodies both of the views about transfer payments that we outlined at the top of the show. One view is that they are good. They help build your human capital.

Other people say that they're bad because they rob initiative and take money from taxpayers and give it to people who are less productive. Edith definitely sees both sides of this. And because of this nuanced view, Edith saw distinctions in the welfare system that I wasn't very aware of. For example, the word welfare itself - she told us, with great pride, one thing I never did - I never went on welfare.

KENNEY: Right, she kept saying that over and over, like, I've always worked. I took food stamps. I did these other things. But I was never on welfare. And that's because welfare, to her, is this one specific program. It used to be called AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent Children.

Then it went through welfare reform. And how it's called TANF, Transitional Aid to Needy Families. It's money that's given to families with children. And it's not specifically targeted towards food or day care. It's just cash that's given to families. And in Edith's mind, it's not always used well.

CALZADO: What they do with that money? Enjoy the life.

BLUMBERG: And can you really...

CALZADO: Look my shoes. I bought these shoes when I come here in 1997. The bottom of the shoes was damaged. I took it to my country when I was over there now. And I fixed this over there for - maybe for $2. And I use the shoes. You think they use their shoes? No, please.

BLUMBERG: Do you know people who do that?

CALZADO: Of course.

BLUMBERG: What do they say? What do you mean, what...

CALZADO: Of course. Or I have somebody that - she is in welfare. And she has, I think it was three kids. I don't know if she is pregnant now. Go to my country. You will see what she have over there.

BLUMBERG: Big house?

CALZADO: Yes, beautiful house, you know, beautiful house.

KENNEY: And Alex, you and I also talked to a social scientist named Katherine Newman who studied the working poor a lot, especially the working poor up in Harlem. And she says this attitude that Edith has towards welfare is pretty common. In her experience, if anything, people like Edith who work but then receive some type of government assistance, they're even less forgiving of welfare recipients than the public at large.

BLUMBERG: And it makes sense when you think about it. If you think about Edith, who is getting help but also working so hard and denying herself so much, someone who just collects government money and doesn't work - it's really infuriating. And for her, it's not like an abstraction. To Edith, welfare cheats are very real. And they're are all around. You know, they're her relatives. They're friends. They're neighbors.

CALZADO: Yeah, in front of me there is a woman. She is in welfare. She is in welfare. She makes her hair, like, blonde. And you see the nails. To keep this nail good, you have to go every week to the nail parlor - nail store, you know? Twenty-three or something like that, it depends what you want. This is money.

BLUMBERG: That's our tax dollars paying for those nails.

CALZADO: And from where that - the money come from? Your money. The tax you pay, my...

(LAUGHTER)

KENNEY: OK Alex, so let's try to put this in context. How much, exactly, of our federal tax dollars are actually going to transfer payments? How much of the taxpayer money is going to Edith and, of course, Edith's neighbor also?

BLUMBERG: All right, so let's first - let's say up front, if you actually look at the government figures, the transfer payment that Edith has the most problems with - what she called welfare, which is just cash payments to income families - that is a very small number, just 0.6 percent of your tax bill. Less than 1 percent of your tax bill goes to that program.

KENNEY: But if you look at other programs, like food stamps and Medicaid, it's a much bigger number. Almost 10 percent of our federal tax bill is going to pay for Edith and Sammy's health care and food. And then when you add in state and local taxes, it's a little more.

BLUMBERG: And just to compare - the transfer payments we pay to Edith and other poor people are dwarfed by transfer payments we pay to another group, the elderly - Medicare and Social Security. That is a little under half of our tax bill.

This woman's name is Edith Calzado and she is perhaps the single most successful and productive
Beneficiary of government transfer payments you'll ever meet
Transfer payments think of welfare and food stamps some people in the country earn more than they need to cover their basic
Necessities and the government taxes those people and give some of that money to people the government thinks don't earn enough to cover their basic
Necessities those are transfer payments and there's obviously a really contentious debate about transfer payments
One argument you hear is that transfer payments?
Just don't make economic sense that they punish productive work by taxing it and then reward other people for not being productive
Some people argue that it takes away the initiative to go out and get a job
If you know you're gonna get this money anyway
And so the argument goes that everyone just ends up poor the rich the poor that these payments aren't good for anyone
No, and this is an economic argument not an immoral argument
There's a there's a moral argument that says it's fine if everyone is poor as long as we live in a fairer society
So transfer payments make sense just on that but there is also an economic
Counter-argument as well that transfer payments if done right actually improve the economy in the long run and this argument says basically
Poverty itself is inefficient trying to keep your family fed while living at the margin
It doesn't allow you to develop
Your human capital in other words extreme poverty keeps you from getting the education you needed to get a good-skilled job
That would help make you and the whole society at large richer
Edith Calzado is the poster child for that second argument so Alex you and I met Edith at an anti-poverty program
That's run by the city
It's called the financial empowerment center
And it's a place where people live in New York and have low incomes can come in and get free financial counseling and advice
She was there having her first interview with her counselor Michelle Murillo
And at first blush Edith seemed to be in pretty bad shape. She was a single mother
She had a restraining order against her husband who'd abused her and she was earning very little money as we found out when Michelle
Asked Edith about her income
Roughly on average a month this year. I make like
11,000 no per month. Oh per month
It's like a
900 and
How much you spend money on groceries per month how much you spend, you know, I don't spend
With stamp and also there is
Some place they have food pantry. Okay, and I go there, too
And
Your debt the stuff that you think you owe out there. What do you think it is around?
How much do you think you owe out there roughly?
Like a
2300
So initially this was this was a pretty good picture Alex
We're just sitting here hearing how little she makes and how much she owes and it turns out that Edith does have other ways
She makes income on the side. She cleans offices and sells baked goods around her neighborhood
But even with this extra money
She told us she only brings in about sixteen thousand dollars a year, which this was pretty scary for me to learn
But apparently in New York City that is still considered above the poverty line
It's just barely above the poverty line
But making sixteen thousand dollars a year puts you above the poverty line for a family of two
And as she said she has twenty three hundred dollars in debt. That was credit card debt
But as she continued this counseling session more and more emerged about Edith and the picture started to change
So for example, she has nine hundred dollars in savings. She puts away at least twenty to thirty dollars a month
And then that debt that credit card debt. It turns out it's all interest free
So Edith is really good at taking those teaser rates from banks
You know when they say zero percent interest until January 2011 or whatever and she milks them for all their worth
She's also really good at getting those store credit cards
You know when you're shopping in Filene's and they're like if you sign up today, we'll give you a ten percent discount
She would do that
She would sign up for the store card use it for the discount and then just pay off the balance and close the card
Michelle the counselor pulled Edith's credit report and she wouldn't tell us the number on tape
But her credit report was excellent. That's your credit score. Yeah. Excellent
Okay, so let's go over what you've got going on here
You have a CS card that has been closed by you zero balance, right?
Chase Toys R Us closed zero gap closed zero
Coles
Zero and it's open
So Alex you and I were sitting there listening to this and we're thinking this is so different from that story
You usually hear about the poor person who's being taken advantage of by all these credit card companies or predatory lenders
We're saying hey
We'll give you all this money for a low rate and then they end up really in debt and they don't know what
To do Edith was taking advantage of those low rates
But then she was paying them off before the companies could even charge her interest
So she was taking their money not the other way around
Mandy's
zero
Citibank closed zero
Children's police
zero
Okay, I gotta say Alex at this point when we're sitting there hearing this I started to feel
Kind of bad about my own financial situation
Just was so savvy and I was like we have a lot to learn from Edith
So we decided let's spend some more time with her
So a couple months after meeting her at this financial empowerment center
We caught up with her again and spent the day with her and I asked her about all those teaser rate credit cards
She'd opened. So have you ever had a
Have you ever paid an interest rate on a credit card? No, no way
So you've never paid a bank fee
No, no, no, no, no, and how much money have you borrowed?
Interest-free do you think over the course of your life? How much money have you borrowed in total? Yeah. Yeah, it's like
13,000
13,000. Yeah 13,000. So you've borrowed 13 thousand dollars from them
For free. Yeah for free. All right for those of you keeping score at home. That's Edith calzado
$13,000 Citibank zero. Well, it's not exactly zero
She does pay a bounce transfer fee of three percent
All right
but still we looked it up and Edith a Dominican immigrant on food stamps is borrowing money more cheaply than the average highly rated US
Corporation is and in fact just recently one of these interest-free loans that she got enabled Edith to treat her son
Sammy to something he had never experienced before a vacation at a resort in the Dominican Republic. I
pay
103 dollar for my son and I everything included
From Friday to Saturday and now you are allowed to enjoy the six hotel in the resort. This was
also my son say also
Everything was awesome. Here's Edith's son Sammy who's nine years old and they had
Four hotels and there was like this little train that would pick you up and it would take you to any of the hotels
you wanted and
Then we also went to Ocean World
Which where we got to play with dolphins and sea lions? Wow, that sounds pretty cool
Yeah, and I got to dance with a dolphin you dance with a dolphin. Yeah, this is a better dancer. You had the dolphin
So again, you've got to do all this by borrowing money interest-free
So she was able to spread out the cost of this trip
Into a whole bunch of different installments that she never paid any interest on
Now the fact that Edith was able to do that as an immigrant from the Dominican Republic living at the poverty level is
Pretty surprising, but it's even more surprising
Given Edith's life story which she shared with us during the day that we spent with her
He explained to us that she's one of 12 children from a big Dominican family
She came to the US in 1997 when she was in her early 30s
And she lived along with six of her sisters and one of her brothers in her mother's tiny one-bedroom apartment
We were living and sleeping two and three in twin bed because my mother didn't have a lot of money, you know to
So when you first got to this country you were there was eight of you and and and you had to there's two and
three in one bed
So in your twin bed it was you and one other sister or two
One other was three and my mother was two. How did you get to be the lucky one with only two?
Because my other sister is fat and I was a skinny
Nobody can fit in the bed
It was actually this mattress situation that introduced Edith to her future abusive husband
The story is that she was over at a friend of her sister's house and this friend was a little bit better off
And she said hey, I have an extra mattress for you guys
You won't have to double up much just take it at first Edith tried to protest but the friend insisted
She didn't give me another option
I took my bed went to say oh we have car service around here
Let me call and they was saying somebody has a station wagon or minivan
the father of my son come
He was the driver. He was the driver and he is still
driving by that time
How I tell you
Sometime
Now I'm more careful, you know now I'm more careful I'm
Already almost three and a half year two and a half year
No matter how mean you know, I'm more careful because sometime
sweet word
That sound like honey is like
poisoning
Edith talks to us a lot about her ex-husband how she'd fallen for him in the beginning and how he turned on her and
She told us that he never gave her any money for her or their son
So she was forced to go around to the neighborhood food pantries and just try to put together
Whatever she could for her and Sammy to eat even though her husband made pretty good money. Yeah
She said he kept all the money for himself
Eventually three years ago though. She did succeed in getting away from him
She got a restraining order and her and Sammy were able to move to a different place
And this is one of these things that I always think about Caitlin is that when you go to talk to somebody as a
Journalist or whatever you're just meeting them at a particular moment in their life and you don't know
How their life is actually gonna turn out and so what I keep thinking like if we had met Edith a couple years
ago when she was still with her abusive husband and working at McDonald's we would have thought like man
What is gonna happen to her and especially what's gonna happen to Sammy her son?
It seems like they're really trapped in the situation today
It feels very different and the reason Edith's life is so different today than what we might have pictured had we met her
Back then is that she's gotten a lot of help from the government
She is a huge recipient of transfer payments
We sat down with her and totaled up all the things that she's gotten over the years
And she told us that up until Sammy was five. She got free food from the government under the wick program
She also had her childcare paid for under the New York City child welfare program
And up until today almost all her expenses are defrayed or paid for entirely by a government program food
For example, she gets food stamps. Her health insurance is covered under Medicaid
When she left her husband her legal fees were paid for by a government program to help victims of domestic abuse
And just recently she got off the waiting list for a subsidized apartment in a Bronx
Housing project so she was paying nine hundred and fifty dollars a month in rent
And I remember when she told us that and we're sitting there doing the math in our heads being like wait a minute
She just told us she only makes nine hundred dollars. Like how is she doing this? How is she getting by? Right?
I know it was almost all the money that she made and it was for a tiny apartment where she and Sammy shared a bedroom
Now she only pays two hundred and seventy one dollars for a much bigger place
It's wonderful. He saw I said that God God was in the middle this
Blessing because I have big apartment. My son has his own bathroom
You know, I don't pay gas. I don't pay electricity. I can have my washing machine in the home
You know, I can has a air condition all the rooms, you know, I pay less rain
This is the more important thing
So here is the question
How should we think about all these transfer payments that Edith is getting now?
Obviously like, you know, I we like to eat it then we're happy that she's doing better
But again leaving aside the morality of the argument is this a good investment
Will it pay off and with Edith it could go either way. She could eventually start earning a lot more money
Maybe she'll go back to school
Maybe she'll end up, you know earning as much money as she's received in transfer payments
But when you think about her son, Sammy
It really starts to look like a pretty good investment
If you just think about his life without the food stamps the wick the government money to pay for his child care
His life would have been much different. Yeah, my image of that life is pretty scary
you know Alex I recently went to Haiti with Adam and
we went into this very small village in the town of La Tiponi and we saw these families and their kids and
Immediately when they see the first thing they say is we're hungry
We're hungry. Do you have any food and they're living in these really small handmade huts one room
And the parents are just struggling to get through every day
sometimes they have to pull their kids out of school because they need them to work or they can't afford the school fees and
Every day is just such a struggle to survive. There's no time to think about the future or
Education because you're just like what am I gonna feed my kid tomorrow?
Like what are we gonna do if I get sick or my child gets sick and you know child development experts
We'll tell you that it you know
If you are not getting the proper nourishment if you're not getting the proper
Medical care or you're not getting the proper stimulation when you're a very little kid
You might end up with a permanent skill deficit as an adult like what happens to you when you're a little baby can have
You know sort of long-term consequences on your future life
And of course that has economic consequences the more people in a society without skills the worse off the economy is gonna be
But of course Sammy is sort of the opposite picture of that because of government transfer payments
He had steady food. He had a place to live again both provided by the government instead of focusing on survival
His mom was able to focus on his education. She got him into this gifted program where he's thriving
He's in fourth grade, but reading far above his grade level. He's one of those kids who already seems destined for college
I'm on level you what's level you it has hard books, though
What books are hard?
Well, sometimes when I just feel like I want to read something harder than my level
I read levels like X and Z and
Sometimes the level Z books are hard for me
so I go back so I go down the letters and right now I have a an
X-book in my book baggie, and it looks really interesting because I read the blurb and it's like very interesting
It's about a boy that he had a pet deer and his family has to fight off wolves because they live in the wild
wilderness and they have to fight off wolves and
moose and
Other creatures in the wild and then one day they have to part with the deer
because they're like gonna move to a city or something and
You don't see anybody in the city with a pet deer. So they have to part with it and
And right there
What's it called? Do you remember?
If you're looking at Sammy, it looks like our taxpayer investment Edith is going to pay off
Of course, there's still lots of hurdles ahead for him
But if Sammy gets a degree and a good job, he'll pay in taxes more than he's received in transport payments
So you would think that the way Edith thinks about transfer payments is pretty straightforward
But we talked her about it and it's not straightforward at all
On the one hand she recognizes and is grateful for all the help that the government has given her
She thinks that's a good thing
but then she'll start talking about other types of transfer payments that the government is giving to people that she knows are in
Our community and she can sound a little like Ronald Reagan in the 80s talking about welfare queens
It's true that the government cannot control the personal life of the person
But if you say that you don't have a husband and you have three kids why next year you come with four
Well, you got the other one. It's like routine
It becomes the welfare becomes a routine routine for the people are in there like routine
So trying to eat it
She has a much more nuanced view than your average person about transfer payments in America because obviously she's much more in the center
Of it all and and because of that
I think she actually embodies both of the views about transfer payments that we outlined at the top of the show
On the one view is that they're good
They help build your human capital other people say they're bad because they rob initiative and take money from taxpayers and give it to people
Who are less productive Edith definitely sees both sides of this and
Because of this nuanced view Edith saw distinctions in the welfare system that I wasn't very aware of for example the word welfare itself
She told us with great pride one thing I never did I never went on welfare, right?
She kept saying that over and over like I've always worked. I took food stamps
I did these other things but I was never on welfare and that's because welfare to her is this one specific program
It used to be called AFDC aid to families with dependent children that went through welfare reform and now it's called TANF
Transitional aid to needy families. It's money that's given to families with children and it's not specifically targeted towards food or daycare
It's just cash that's given to families and in Edith's mind. It's not always used
Well, that's how what they do with that money
Enjoy the life and can you really choose?
I bought these shoes when I come here in 1997
The the bottom of the truth was damaged
I took it to my country when I was over there now and I think it's over there for maybe for two dollars
And I use the truth you think they use the truth. No, please
Do you know people who do that? Of course, like what do they say? What do you mean? What's a or I have?
I have somebody that she is in welfare and she has I think was three kicks. I don't know. She's pregnant now
Go to my country
You will see what you have over there
Big house. Yes
Beautiful house, you know beautiful house and
Alex you and I also talked to a social scientist named Catherine Newman who studied the working poor a lot
Especially the working poor up in Harlem
And she says this attitude that Edith has towards welfare is pretty common in her experience
If anything people like Edith who work but then receive some type of government assistance
They're even less forgiving of welfare recipients than the public at large
And it makes sense when you think about it if you think about Edith who is getting help
But also working so hard and denying herself so much someone who just collects government money and doesn't work
It's really infuriating and for her
It's not like an abstraction to Edith welfare cheats are very real and they're all around, you know
They're her relatives. They're friends their neighbors
Yeah in front of me there is a woman
He's in welfare
She's a warfare she said she make her hair like like
Blonde and you see the nail
To keep man to keep this nail good. You have to go every week
To the to the nail parlor nail store, you know
23 or something like that depend what you want
This is money. That's our tax dollars paying for those nails out from where that the money come from your money
Okay, Alex, so let's try to put this in context how much exactly of our federal tax dollars are actually going to transfer payments
How much of the taxpayer money is going to Edith and of course Edith's neighbor also, alright
So let's first let's say up front if you actually look at the government figures
The transfer payment that Edith has the most problems with what she called welfare
Which is just cash payments to low-income families. That is a very small number just point
6% of your tax bill less than 1% of your tax bill goes to that program
But if you look at other programs like food stamps and Medicaid, it's a much bigger number
Almost 10% of our federal tax bill is going to pay for Edith and Sammy's health care and food
And then when you add in state and local taxes, it's a little more and just to compare the transfer payments that we pay
To Edith and other poor people are dwarfed by transfer payments
We pay to another group the elderly Medicare and Social Security
That is a little under half
