A tale of violence, payback, and how to make things right.

* Note: This episode has depictions of violence and explicit language.

On November 2nd, 1983, Darrell Cannon was awoken by a pounding on his door. It was the Chicago police. They told him he was a suspect in a murder case, and they wanted him to confess that he was involved. When he didn't confess, the cops put him a car, drove him to a rural site, and tortured him. Darrell gave a confession that would land him in prison for more than 20 years.

And Darrell's torture: It was not an isolated incident. A group of Chicago police officers tortured confessions out of some 118 suspects over a span of 20 years. Years later, Chicago has offered the victims a reparations package - in the form of an apology, acknowledgement, counseling, a memorial. And some money.

Today on the show: Darrell Cannon's story: a tale of violence, payback, and how to make things right.

NOEL KING, HOST:

Before we get started, just a quick note, this story has language and depictions of violence that might not be appropriate for children. OK, here goes.

On November 2, 1983, Darrell Cannon was home in bed on the South Side of Chicago, and he woke up to this loud bang-bang-bang at the door.

DARRELL CANNON: Any time you hear some banging like that, you know it's got to be police.

KING: This was not Darrell's first run-in with the police. He'd served time before. The cops rushed in, and Darrell thought, I should hide. So he jumped into a closet. How did you hide in the closet?

CANNON: Just hid in the closet and put clothes in front of me. And at first, they opened the closet door, and then he left the door open. He thought I wasn't in there. And then another one of them happened to move the clothes to the side, and there I was.

KING: And there was the cop.

CANNON: He had a shotgun. He jumped back and pointed the shotgun at me, said get out of there. Let me seen your hands - let me see your hands.

KING: The cop cuffed him and made him lie down while the other cops tossed his house looking for guns. So now Darrell's there on the floor, and he's looking around. And he's watching his cat freak out. His cat's name, by the way, is Killer.

CANNON: Killer went up the wall (laughter). The white folks scared the living daylights out of Killer. Killer was running everywhere (laughter).

KING: When they were done searching, the cops frogmarched Darrell downstairs and put him in the back of an unmarked car. They told him a man had been murdered and they thought he had something to do with it. Darrell had been through this before, so he knew the routine - or he thought he did. At the police station, they parked him in an interview room, and then, after a couple of minutes, a detective walked in. He had a brown paper shopping bag, and he pulled something out of it. It was about 2 feet long with prongs sticking out.

CANNON: That was my first time seeing the cattle prod.

KING: A cattle prod.

CANNON: He said, you going to tell us what we want to know? And I looked at him, said I ain't got nothing to tell you. He said OK. You're going to talk before the day is over with, and he put the cattle prod back in the bag and walked back out.

KING: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Noel King. Today on the show, the story of Darrell Cannon, a guy who'd be the first to tell you he broke lots of rules back in the day, but then the people who were supposed to be enforcing the rules broke them even harder. The city of Chicago is now trying to make up for it, but it's not easy. There's no roadmap. And what really is enough?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DONT ASK WHY")

UNIDENTIFIED ARTIST: (Singing) Walls, how do we break them down? Why do you paint so blue, so blue? Try...

KING: Here's how Darrell wound up in a room with a cop and a cattle prod. He grew up on the South Side of Chicago. He was a pretty typical kid. He was a really big Elvis fan. He went to all of Elvis' movies.

CANNON: I liked them because of the girls. Every movie that Elvis has ever been in, he has some beautiful women around him, whether it was Ann-Margret or somebody else.

KING: He had to be a little careful going to the theater because the South Side streets were carved up by gangs. Darrell was actually in a gang himself. He joined as a teenager. They were called the Blackstone Rangers. And the theater was in a rival gang's territory.

CANNON: I would go there and sit in the theater and wait until the film start. And I would see my Elvis movie. And when my Elvis movie was over with, I would take the long way around going back home because I couldn't take the same route I took because the gangs was out now.

KING: Darrell carried a gun.

CANNON: I had a .22, a five-shot .22 that I would carry with me. Just in case my rivals came across me in their neighborhood, I had some kind of firepower to get away.

KING: Darrell was living with his mom back then, and she was not pleased about any of this, the gangs and the guns, so he hid it from her.

CANNON: When I got away from the house, I would put my black scarf on my head, which is - signify I'm a Ranger. But as soon as I got near the house, I'd take it out because if I didn't, my mama would knock it off.

KING: She would beat you?

CANNON: Ooh-hoo (ph).

KING: (Laughter).

CANNON: My mama didn't play. My mama didn't play.

KING: So there were his mom's rules. But Darrell says there were also rules in the gang. Like, if you saw one of your rivals walking with his parents or his girlfriend, you left him alone. But if he was on his own and you had a score to settle, he's fair game. Darrell even had a title. He was called a shooter.

Why were you considered a shooter?

CANNON: Because I would shoot.

KING: You had - because you had good aim or because you had a gun?

CANNON: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I was - you know, anytime you seen me wear a black wristband, you knew I had that gun on me because the gun was so powerful that I needed the wristband so that I could hold it like this here to shoot. And I was extremely accurate. And some of my rivals, one in particular - I won't mention his name - he was very deadly, too. In fact, he had shot my hat off my head one night in an ambush. He let me know that OK, almost got you. You know, I said OK. Now it's my turn.

KING: Darrell spent his teens in the gang. And then in 1971, he was convicted of murdering a man. He spent 12 years in prison and then he was paroled. When he got out, he went straight back to gang life, which brings us to the morning of the raid in 1983. From the minute the cops found him in the closet, Darrell knew something was different here than in his other run-ins with the police because when they found him, they started calling him names.

CANNON: Grown man - first time in my life being called a [expletive] by a white person, yes.

KING: That was the first time?

CANNON: First time.

KING: 1983?

CANNON: 1983.

KING: So now, Darrell tells me, he's an interview room, and there's a cattle prod. And he has no idea what to think. That's when the three cops take him outside and put him back in the car. And they start driving him southeast, out of the city. They drive to this deserted place, this rural place. And there's a big pipe - it's big enough for the car to fit through. They drive through the pipe, and they come out the other side. And he sees a pond and a road that climbs up a hill.

CANNON: They drove up that hill, turned the car around. They got me out the car, and one of the first things they said was [expletive], look around. Nobody's going to hear or see nothing we do to you. And when I looked around, there was nothing but isolated area. Now I started to get concerned. I said uh-oh. Now, this ain't right at all.

KING: One of the cops gets a shotgun out of the trunk, tells Darrell open your mouth. When Darrell won't, the cop forces the gun in.

CANNON: Split my lip and he chipped my two teeth. And then when they had the barrell in my mouth, they said OK, [expletive] you going to tell us what we want to hear. And I'm trying to tell them - I don't know nothing. And then one of them said go ahead, shoot that [expletive]. And that's when they pulled the trigger (imitating trigger pull). And then he took the shotgun back out. He say, now [expletive], listen.

KING: The cop turns away from Darrell and makes like he's loading the shotgun, and then he puts it back in Darrell's mouth. He does this two more times.

CANNON: And then the third time, when I heard that trigger click, in my mind, my mind told me that he had just blew the back of my head off 'cause my hair stood straight up. And at that point, I was beyond fear. Fear wasn't even an option anymore. I honestly thought I was going to die.

KING: Darrell's thinking it can't get any worse. He's in the middle of nowhere. They're mock executing him. And then it does get worse.

CANNON: And they open the back door of the detective car and made me turn sideways and sit down sideways in the detective car where my feet was outside the detective car. They pull my pants and my shorts down. And that's when Sergeant Byrne was standing in front of me with that cattle prod and Grunhard came around to the backseat and he pulled my hands up. And when he did, he jerked my hands, my cuffs, and I laid down on the back seat. And Byrne turned the cattle prod on and stuck it to my testicles. And the pain that I felt from that was something that I ain't never felt before in my life. And in doing so...

KING: In doing so, they finally broke him.

CANNON: I say, OK, I'll tell you anything you want to hear. And then they started asking me questions all over again. And I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the way it was. That's the way it was because by the end my mind was so messed up.

KING: Daryl confessed, said he was there when the murder happened, that he didn't pull the trigger, but that he was an accomplice. And before they took him to jail, they stopped at a gas station.

CANNON: At the gas station, they said, you want something to drink? Because my throat was dry and it was supposed to be so cold outside, they thought I wanted coffee. I said, no, no, no; get me a pop. I want something cold. And they took my money that they had took from me and bought me a pop (laughter) with my money. Yeah...

KING: See, I...

CANNON: And then I bought them something, too. They took my money and spent it on themselves as well. I mean, they...

KING: I - you can - you laugh. You can laugh.

CANNON: Yeah, because it is so sickening that it's comical. You know, you don't think that, for one moment, people that swore to serve and protect would act like this.

KING: The cops take Darrell to the county jail. The next morning, he finally sees his lawyer. And he tells his lawyer, these guys tortured me. And his lawyer tells him, all right, draw me a picture.

CANNON: When they took you, who did what, everything. I said, man, I can't draw. He said, give me some stick figures. I said, OK. And that's what I did.

KING: Darrell went to trial in 1984. He tried to get his confession suppressed, but he couldn't. He was found guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to life in prison based on a confession that the police had tortured out of him. So Darrell sits in prison - 1984, '85, '86, '87, '88.

And at this point, we're going to leave the story of Darrell Cannon for a little while because outside the prison walls, something really big was happening, something that would eventually force Chicago to take another look at Darryl's case. In 1989, a reporter in Chicago named John Conroy got a tip from a friend. It wasn't about Darrell's case. It was about a different inmate, a guy who said he'd been tortured into a confession by Chicago police officers. The reporter, John Conroy, thought it sounded crazy.

JOHN CONROY: I didn't think it was possible. At the time, you know, a police officer's word was the Bible truth.

KING: But he went to this man's trial anyway. The guy's name was Andrew Wilson. And Wilson had evidence of torture. There were pictures taken after his interrogation where his skin looked burned. Conroy started to believe him, and he wrote a story about Wilson. And not long after the story ran, Conroy started getting letters from Darrell Cannon, who was sitting in jail. In one of those letters, Darrell included the drawings that he'd done right after he was tortured.

CONROY: What was remarkable was that he had drawn pictures of his torture. And so he drew a picture of a cattle prod.

KING: Conroy eventually wrote about Darrell and about other men who came forward. There was a law firm, the People's Law Office, that had been collecting these stories of torture.

CONROY: You know, originally, they had probably eight names of people who had been either shocked or otherwise - or otherwise suffered serious abuse. And then it expanded. It was 16. It was 38. It was 52. And now it's at 118.

KING: Here's what emerged - for 20 years, a group of Chicago police officers known as the midnight crew banged on doors and took men from their homes or snatched them from the street and threw them in cars and tortured them. And the city knew about this for years. But over time, the tide of stories made it impossible to ignore. Some of the men won new trials and were released. And Chicago was left with this huge question - how do you make something like this right?

CONROY: There is no guidebook for this. There's no expert you go to and say, well, what did Cincinnati do, or what happened in Tulsa? There's no answer.

KING: One way to make things right would be for the police officers behind all this to go to trial. That didn't happen. The statute of limitations had run out, so it was too late to charge these guys. The ringleader, John Burge, was eventually charged with perjury. That was for lying about the torture. He was sentenced to four and a half years. He got time off for good behavior. I reached out to him and the officers Darrell accuses of torturing him, but I didn't hear back. So what could make this right for all those men who were tortured?

One way we try to do this is with money. But exactly how much money? It's not like there's a formula here. Every guy's story was different. Some of them spent years in prison, some of them spent decades. Some were innocent. They were exonerated. Some were guilty. What they had in common was the torture. Some did sue the city. But the amount of money each guy got could seem sort of random. Ronald Kitchen was one of the torture victims. A couple years ago, Ronald was exonerated after 21 years in prison. When he got out, he sued Chicago. And as he remembers it, he just kind of picked a number.

RONALD KITCHEN: It had to be - what? - I think it was 68 million, or some [expletive] like that.

KING: Sixty-eight million - why? Why'd you pick that number?

KITCHEN: I was just throwing out a number.

KING: You just threw - you picked...

KITCHEN: Listen, the thing was, you want them to recognize, to take heed.

KING: Did you pick 68 million out of the hat?

KITCHEN: I just told them I want - what? - 7 million for a year. It was some crazy number. I can't remember what I was talking about. They was like, fine. It was - it was - and I meant that. It was - I think I wanted 3 million - 3 million for each year, or something like that.

KING: Three times 21.

KITCHEN: Yeah, it was something like that.

KING: Ronald settled for just over $6 million. But other guys weren't exonerated like Ronald was. They'd served their full sentences, and so much time had passed that the statute of limitations had run out. They couldn't sue the city. They'd need another option. Meanwhile, a group of activists and lawyers and victims were pushing Chicago to make a big gesture to acknowledge that the torture had happened and to apologize for it. They wanted a very specific word used - reparations.

JOEY MOGUL: It felt very important to us, and it felt like the only fitting term.

KING: That is Joey Mogul. She's a lawyer, and she's been working with some of these guys for years. She co-founded Chicago Torture Justice Memorials. That's the activist group that led this effort. And look, Joey knew that reparations is a heavy word. It's usually used when we talk about making amends for slavery. That's why these activists liked the term. The men who were tortured were all black or Latino. The officers were white. The torture ruined lives, tore apart families. And amazingly, the city of Chicago said, yes, we will make reparations.

CONROY: I think the use of the word, reparations, is stunning.

KING: That's John Conroy, the reporter who spent years covering this.

CONROY: You can't find another case in the United States where a city has paid reparations to people who have been tortured or otherwise abused by a police force. And so as soon as you start talking about paying reparations to a population of people that's largely African-American, you open up a pretty interesting chapter in the United States' history.

KING: The torture victims we're going to get their apology, but they wanted something else, too. They wanted money. And this turned out to be a really big sticking point. It took years of back-and-forth negotiations to figure out what's enough. The activists doing the negotiating first asked for a $20 million package, and the city came back with zero.

MOGUL: The city was refusing to provide any financial compensation whatsoever.

KING: The victims said, OK, we'll go down to 12 million. The city offered two to three. They settled on 5.5 million, split evenly among 57 torture victims. Each man got $100,000, including Darrell Cannon, who was tortured with a cattle prod. Darrell spent more than 20 years in prison. In 2007, after a new hearing, he got out. He went back to the south side. And then, this year, he got the news. There was a check made out to him from the city of Chicago. He was finally going to get reparations. The checks were going to be mailed out, but Darrell was like, uh-uh.

CANNON: I went and got it.

KING: Why?

CANNON: Because I don't trust (laughter) - I don't trust the system. I don't want you talking about, we sent it. Oh, you haven't gotten it yet? You know, well, let's wait a while. No, no, no, no. I don't - I done went through too many changes with you. I don't trust you. I'm coming to get my money.

KING: He went on in to the treasurer's office.

CANNON: I went in and said, my name is Darrell Cannon, and I'm here to pick up my money. And they, in turn, said, may I see your ID? They already knew what money I was talking about. I didn't even have to say torture money. You know, they knew. And I showed them, and the man gave me my check.

KING: It was $97,000. The city had deducted some money because of a small payout many years ago. A few weeks after Darrell got the money, I met him at his house on the South Side of Chicago. He's an old guy now. He's got grandkids and this little, black dog called Tiny Anne that follows him around everywhere. I wanted to know how he felt about getting the money and what it meant to him, so I asked him how he was spending it. And he said on his family, mostly.

He sent some cash to his kids and his grandkids down South. His brother died earlier this year, and Darrell paid for the funeral. He got his brother a nice plot on a hill. He says that's so his brother can look down on people. He bought his wife a diamond ring, and he says that her knees got weak when he gave it to her. And he bought himself a couple things, too - a 2014 Chevy Impala to replace his old junker and a new phone. He was happy to show them off.

It's a beautiful car. What color is that? That's gold?

CANNON: I like to call it champagne.

KING: Champagne?

CANNON: Yes, ma'am.

KING: I like that.

CANNON: Very eloquent and nice, you know? And like I say, you don't see a lot of them around. And that's another reason why I picked it out - because of the color.

KING: Tell me about your phone - your Galaxy.

CANNON: Oh, yeah. This is the Galaxy 6. I had told myself that whenever I got some money, I was going to turn in my Galaxy 3 and get me a Galaxy 6.

KING: That phone is champagne, too, isn't it?

CANNON: Almost.

KING: You like the color.

CANNON: Yeah, well, it suits the car and the phone, you know? And I like to be kind of color-coordinated.

KING: Suits the man, too.

CANNON: You know, what can I say? Only in America (laughter).

KING: Talking to Darrell, it's impossible not to feel happy for him, but you feel something else, too. Twenty years in prison, all he lost, and the city gave him $100,000. When I met him, he had about nine grand left. Darrell is old friends with one of the other torture victims, Ronald Kitchen. That's the guy who sued the city and won $6 million. They grew up on the same streets. And I asked Darrell and Ronald if they'd be willing to talk to each other about the money. They agreed, so we set up a phone call. Ronald was in Philly, and I was with Darrell in Chicago.

CANNON: How you be, brother man?

KITCHEN: I'm good. How you doing?

CANNON: I'm taking it one day at a time, so...

KING: You went through kind of the same experience, but Ronald sued the city and got more than $6 million, and Darrell got $100,000. Does it ever get weird for you?

KITCHEN: I - you know, I think people think that you get 6.7 million, they feel that, you know - you know, that the city done paid for it. But like I always said, it's not about the money. It don't matter because it's not about how much money you get because the things that was taken away from you, you can't buy that with money.

KING: Darrell, you - you don't feel jealous that Ronald got 6.7 million?

CANNON: No. Look, for all the - I have told him they should have got more than 6 million. And I meant just that.

KING: Are the two of you unusual, do you think?

CANNON: I cannot speak for other people. I can speak for me. The money didn't make or break me, in no sight, form or fashion. And it is not something that I dwell on and wish that it was more.

KING: I talked to a handful of men who got the reparations money. Most said they spent it on mundane things and necessities, like a new wristwatch, furniture, mortgage payments. When I asked if it was enough, they all said basically the same thing - your question is crazy. Of course it's not enough. Nothing could ever be enough. Asking about numbers is missing the point.

The guys are going to get a couple of other things - free community college for them and their kids and their grandkids, job training, psychological counseling. But there is one other thing that Darrell would like, and that has to do with the men who tortured him.

CANNON: You know, my lawyers don't like for me to say what I'm getting ready to say, but I still say it anyway. And that is I cannot stand the air that they breathe. I hate them just that much.

KING: And if he got a chance to be in the same room with them...

CANNON: I would love to use a cattle prod on any one of them.

KING: You wouldn't.

CANNON: Yes, I would. You know, I know it's wrong to say.

KING: Would you?

CANNON: Yes, yes, yes, because I would want them to experience what I felt. And I would shock them until one of two things happened - they had a heart attack or the batteries died. I ain't lying. I ain't lying. If it took all day, I'd - (imitating cattle prod).

KING: None of this is simple. None of this is fixed. Some of the men who got reparations checks are still in prison. That means Chicago admits they were tortured into confessions, but they're still locked up. So everyone said no amount of money could ever be enough, but there was one thing that all of these guys agreed on - everyone I spoke to. As part of this reparations package, every 8th and 10th grader in the city of Chicago is going to learn about this torture. It's going to be part of the school curriculum. Every one of the guys said this is what's important to me, that they're going to tell our story.

In fact, he had shot my head off my head one night in an ambush
He let me know that okay
Almost got you. I said, okay now it's my turn
Darryl spent his teens in the gang and then in
1971 he was convicted of murdering a man
He spent 12 years in prison and then he was paroled when he got out
He went straight back to gang life which brings us to the morning of the raid in
1983 from the minute the cops found him in the closet Darryl knew something was different here than in his other run-ins with the police
Because when they found him they started calling him names
grown man
First time in my life being called a nigga
About a white person. Yes, that was the first time first time
1983
1983
So now Darryl tells me he's in an interview room and there's a cattle prod and he has no idea what to think
That's when the three cops take him outside and put him back in the car and they start driving him
Southeast out of the city. They drive to this deserted place this rural place and there's a big pipe
It's big enough for the car to fit through they drive through the pipe and they come out the other side
And he sees a pond and a road that climbs up a hill. They drove up that heel
Turned the car around
They got me out the car and one of the first things they see it was nigga. Look around
Nobody's gonna hear or see nothing we do to you and when I looked around
There was nothing but isolated area. Now. I started to get concerned. I was oh
Now this ain't right at all
One of the cops gets a shotgun out of the trunk tells Darryl open your mouth when Darryl won't the cop forces the gun in
Split my lip and he chipped my two teeth. And then when they had the barrel in my mouth
It's okay nigga. You don't tell us we want to hear and I'm trying to tell I don't know nothing
Then when I'm sick, go ahead shoot that nigga. That's when they pull the trigger
And then he took the shotgun back out. He's seen a nigga
Listen the cop turns away from Darryl and makes like he's loading the shotgun and then he puts it back in Darryl's mouth
He does this two more times now the third time when I heard that trigger
click in my mind my mind told me that he had just blew the back of my head off cuz my hair stood straight up and
At that point I was beyond fear
fear wasn't even
Option anymore. I honestly thought I was gonna die. Darryl's thinking it can't get any worse
He's in the middle of nowhere. They're mock executing him and then it does get worse
they open the back door of the detective car made me turn sideways and
Sit down sideways in a detective car where my feet was outside the detective car
they pull my pants and my shorts down and
That's when
Sergeant Burns
was standing in front of me with that cowl prow and
Grunharz came around to the back seat
And he pulled my hands up and when he did he jerked my hands
my cuffs and I laid down on the back seat and Burns turned the cowl prow and stuck to my testicles and
the pain that I feel from that was
Something that I never felt and before in my life and in doing so
In doing so they finally broke him I
Said okay. I'll tell you anything you want to hear and then they started asking me questions all over again
And I said, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the way it was
That's where it was because by the end my mind was
Was so messed up Darryl confessed said he was there when the murder happened that he didn't pull the trigger
But that he was an accomplice and before they took him to jail. They stopped at a gas station at the gas station
They say you want something to drink because my throat was dry and for it to be so cold outside
They thought I wanted to call that's no no, no, give me a pop. I want something cold and
They took my money that they had took from me and bought me a pop
with my money
Yeah, yeah them something too. They took my money and spent on themselves as well. I mean they
You can you laugh you can laugh because it is so sickening that is comical
You know, you you don't think that for one moment
People that swore to serve and protect would act like this
The cops take Darryl to the county jail the next morning
He finally sees his lawyer and he tells his lawyer these guys tortured me and his lawyer tells him
Alright, draw me a picture where they took you who did what it asked me
I can't draw he said give me some stick figures. I said, okay
And that's what I did Darryl went to trial in 1984. He tried to get his confession suppressed, but he couldn't
He was found guilty of murder and he was sentenced to life in prison
based on a confession that the police had tortured out of him, so
Darryl sits in prison
1984 85 86 87 88 and
At this point we're gonna leave the story of Darryl Cannon for a little while because outside the prison walls
Something really big was happening something that would eventually force Chicago to take another look at Darryl's case in
1989 a reporter in Chicago named John Conroy got a tip from a friend. It wasn't about Darryl's case
It was about a different inmate a guy who said he'd been tortured into a confession by Chicago police officers
The reporter John Conroy thought it sounded crazy. I didn't think it was possible at the time
You know a police officer's word was the Bible truth
But he went to this man's trial anyway
The guy's name was Andrew Wilson and Wilson had evidence of torture
There were pictures taken after his interrogation where his skin looked burned
Conroy started to believe him and he wrote a story about Wilson and not long after the story ran
Conroy started getting letters from Darryl Cannon who was sitting in jail in one of those letters
Darryl included the drawings that he'd done right after he was tortured. What was remarkable was that
He had drawn pictures of his
Torture and so he drew a picture of a cattle prod
Conroy eventually wrote about Darryl and about other men who came forward
There was a law firm the People's Law Office that had been collecting these stories of torture
You know originally it they had probably eight names of people who had been either shocked or otherwise
Or otherwise suffered serious abuse and then it expanded it was 16. It was 38
It was 52 and now it's at 118
Here's what emerged for 20 years a group of Chicago police officers known as the Midnight Crew
banged on doors and took men from their homes or snatched them from the street and threw them in cars and
Tortured them and the city knew about this for years
But over time the tide of stories made it impossible to ignore
Some of the men won new trials and were released and Chicago was left with this huge question
How do you make something like this right? There is no
guidebook for this there's no
Expert you can go to and say well, what did Cincinnati do or what happened in Tulsa? There is no answer
One way to make things right would be for the police officers behind all this to go to trial
That didn't happen the statute of limitations had run out
So it was too late to charge these guys the ringleader John Burge was eventually charged with perjury
That was for lying about the torture. He was sentenced to four and a half years
He got time off for good behavior. I reached out to him and the officers Daryl accuses of torturing him
But I didn't hear back
So what could make this right for all those men who were tortured?
One way we try to do this is with money, but exactly how much money it's not like there's a formula here
Every guy's story was different. Some of them spent years in prison. Some of them spent decades
Some were innocent. They were exonerated
Some were guilty what they had in common was the torture
Some did sue the city, but the amount of money each guy got could seem sort of random
Ronald kitchen was one of the torture victims a couple years ago
Ronald was exonerated after 21 years in prison when he got out he sued Chicago and as he remembers it
He just kind of picked a number he had to be well
I think it was 68 million some shit like that 68 million. Why why did you pick that just throwing out a number?
You just threw you pick. Listen. The thing was you want them to recognize to take heat
Did you pick 68 million out of the hat? I just told me I won't what?
Seven million for a year. It was it was some crazy number
I can't remember what I was talking about that was like fine
It was it was and I meant that it was I think I wanted three million three million for each year
So something like that it was something like that Ronald settled for just over six million dollars
But other guys weren't exonerated like Ronald was they'd served their full sentences in so much time had passed that the statute
Of limitations had run out. They couldn't sue the city. They'd need another option
meanwhile a group of activists and lawyers and victims were pushing Chicago to make a big gesture to acknowledge that the torture had happened and
To apologize for it. They wanted a very specific word used
Reparations it felt very important to us and it felt like the only fitting term that is Joey mogul
She's a lawyer and she's been working with some of these guys for years. She co-founded Chicago torture justice memorials
That's the activist group that led this effort and look Joey knew that reparations is a heavy word
It's usually used when we talk about making amends for slavery
That's why these activists liked the term the men who were tortured were all black or Latino
the officers were white the torture ruined lives tore apart families and
Amazingly the city of Chicago said yes, we will make reparations. I think the use of the word reparations is
Stunning that's John Conroy the reporter who spent years covering this
You can't find another case in the United States where a city has paid reparations to people who have been
tortured or otherwise abused by a police force and so
as soon as you start talking about paying reparations to a
population of people that's largely african-american you open up a
Pretty interesting
Chapter in in the United States history the torture victims were going to get their apology
But they wanted something else to they wanted money and this turned out to be a really big sticking point
It took years of back-and-forth negotiations to figure out what's enough
The activists doing the negotiating first asked for a 20 million dollar package and the city came back with zero
The city was refusing to provide any financial compensation whatsoever
The victims said okay, we'll go down to 12 million the city offered two to three
They settled on five point five million split evenly among 57 torture victims each man got
$100,000 including Darryl Cannon who was tortured with the cattle prod Darryl spent more than 20 years in prison in
2007 after a new hearing he got out
He went back to the south side and then this year he got the news
There was a check made out to him from the city of Chicago. He was finally going to get reparations
The checks were gonna be mailed out, but Darryl was like, uh-uh. I wouldn't got it. Why cuz I don't trust
We sent it you haven't gotten it yet, you know, well, let's wait a while
No, no, no, no, I don't I don't went through too many changes which I don't trust you
I'm coming to get my money. He went on into the treasurer's office
I went in and said my name is Darryl Cannon and I'm here to pick up my money and
They in terms of my CID
They already knew what money I was talking about
I even had to say torture money, you know, they knew and I showed them and the man gave me my check
It was
$97,000 the city had deducted some money because of a small payout many years ago a
Few weeks after Darryl got the money. I met him at his house on the south side of Chicago
He's an old guy now. He's got grandkids and this little black dog called tiny and that follows him around everywhere
I wanted to know how he felt about getting the money and what it meant to him
So I asked him how he was spending it and he said on his family mostly
He sent some cash to his kids and his grandkids down south
His brother died earlier this year and Darryl paid for the funeral. He got his brother a nice plot on a hill
He says that's so his brother can look down on people
He bought his wife a diamond ring and he says that her knees got weak when he gave it to her
and he bought himself a couple things to a
2014 Chevy Impala to replace his old junker and a new phone. He was happy to show him off. It's a beautiful car
Champagne champagne. Yes, ma'am. I like that very eloquent and
Nice, you know and like I say, you don't see a lot of them around and that's another reason why I picked it out
Because of the color tell me about your phone your galaxy. Oh, yeah, this is the galaxy 6
I had told myself that whenever I got some money
I was gonna turn in my galaxy 3 and get me a galaxy 6 that phone is champagne too, isn't it almost?
You like the color. Yeah, well it suits the car and the phone
You know and I like to be kind of color-coordinated suits the man. What can I say only in America?
Talking to Darrell it's impossible not to feel happy for him, but you feel something else, too
20 years in prison all he lost and the city gave him a hundred thousand dollars when I met him
He had about nine grand left
Darrell is old friends with one of the other torture victims Ronald kitchen
That's a guy who sued the city and won six million dollars
They grew up on the same streets and I asked Darrell and Ronald if they'd be willing to talk to each other about the money
They agreed. So we set up a phone call
Ronald was in Philly and I was with Darrell in Chicago. How you be brother, man. I'm good. How you doing?
I'm taking it one day at a time. So
You went through kind of the same experience
but Ronald sued the city and got more than six million dollars and
And and Darrell got one hundred thousand. Does it ever get weird for you?
You know, I think people think that you get six point seven million
they feel that you know, you know that the city doesn't pay for but
like I always say it's it's it's not about the money no matter cuz it's it's not about how much money you get because
The things that was taken away from you. You can't bat it with money
Darrell you you don't feel jealous that Ronald got six point seven million
Father I have told him they should have gotten more than six million and I meant just that
Are the two of you unusual? Do you think I cannot speak for other people?
I can speak for me the money didn't make or break me in no shape form of fashion
and it is not something that I
Dwell on and wish that it was more
I talked to a handful of men who got the reparations money
Most said they spent it on mundane things and necessities like a new wristwatch furniture mortgage payments
When I asked if it was enough, they all said basically the same thing. Your question is crazy
Of course, it's not enough. Nothing could ever be enough
Asking about numbers is missing the point
The guys are gonna get a couple of other things free community college for them and their kids and their grandkids
job training
psychological counseling
But there is one other thing that Darrell would like and that has to do with the men who tortured him
You know my lawyers don't like for me to say what I'm getting ready to say, but I still say it anyway
and that is I
Cannot stand the air that they breathe. I
Hate them just that much and if he got a chance to be in the same room with them
I would love to to use a caliper on any one of them. You wouldn't yes
I would you know, I know it's wrong. Yes. Yes. Yes because I
Would want them to experience
What I felt and I was shocked him until one or two things happen
They had a heart attack or the batteries died
I love I love it took all the edge
None of this is simple
None of this is fixed some of the men who got reparations checks are still in prison
That means Chicago admits they were tortured into confessions, but they're still locked up
So everyone said no amount of money could ever be enough
But there was one thing that all of these guys agreed on everyone
I spoke to as part of this reparations package every eighth and tenth grader in the city of Chicago is gonna learn about this torture
It's gonna be part of the school curriculum
Every one of the guys said this is what's important to me that they're gonna tell our story
