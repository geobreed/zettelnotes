DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

For as long as I can remember, I've seen these ads. I think the first one I saw was just on a telephone pole. It was a piece of paper tacked up, saying something like you can work from home and get rich. Call this number. As I remember, there was a picture of a person wearing pajamas, and there was a cat.

AUDREY QUINN, HOST:

These ads are now all over the Internet.

KESTENBAUM: These days, there are even videos.

QUINN: This is one of my favorites. There's this woman waking up in this big, plush bed. She's covered in what looks like a bear skin rug.

KESTENBAUM: And she has a cat.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Oh, hi there. What is it, like, noon?

QUINN: She sits up, grabs the cat, starts petting its belly.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) So, you want to work from home, huh? No boss, no schedule, making money from home. Doesn't that sound great?

KESTENBAUM: It does sound great and also improbable.

QUINN: Because of course, this is a scam, but it is a very effective one. It's been around for decades, and it will not die.

KESTENBAUM: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

QUINN: And I'm Audrey Quinn.

Today on the show, the anatomy of a scam - what happens when you respond to one of those work from home ads?

KESTENBAUM: We got a secret document that reveals the tricks of the trade.

QUINN: We talk to one of the people who would have been on the other end trying to get your money.

KESTENBAUM: And we have recordings - actual recordings of phone calls where you can hear how the whole thing goes down.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JUST ANOTHER STORY")

UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) You made it look like a shot in the dark. I felt like I spoke a different language.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JUST ANOTHER STORY")

UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) When all you need is just another...

KESTENBAUM: Despite what those work-from-home ads suggest, they are not offering you a job. They're not trying to hire you to work from home. The companies behind those ads are trying to sell you stuff so that, in theory, you can get rich working from home.

QUINN: Here's how it works. When you respond to one of those ads, you give them your name and your contact info. Then, you get a call from someone at a call center saying so, you want to work from home.

RYAN JENSEN: I would have been on the phone. That would've been the first call you would have received.

KESTENBAUM: This is Ryan Jensen. In 2007, he had just graduated from college in St. George, Utah, and he was looking for a job. A friend of his suggested he come to work with him at this call center. The call center industry is big in Utah.

QUINN: His friend takes him to this nondescript office park at the edge of town.

JENSEN: When you first walk in, there's a secretary sitting there. They just had a couch out front. I mean, they had a picture, maybe a plant out and then they just lead you on back into the call floor.

KESTENBAUM: There are about 30 guys back there on the call floor. They actually called it the bullpen. Everyone's sitting in cubicles with headsets on.

QUINN: Ryan's call center offered all types of packages. Most of them were to help you sell stuff online. You want to set up a website? They can build it for you. They'll coach you on how to run a web business, handle all the paperwork, the accounting.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan says the pitch was - this the Internet. It's huge. You can sell to the whole world.

JENSEN: I didn't really understand the online world too much back then. I mean, I was the guy that played football and hated computers. (Laughter) You know, back then, you think yeah, they're going to a great coaching company. They're going to get a website, and they're going to learn how to sell online. This is great.

QUINN: There were some red flags. Sometimes he'd get to the office and find white powder on his desk. Turned out to be residue from people snorting OxyContin.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan's job was to call people who had responded to one of those work-from-home ads and try to convince them that he had a very special offer, try to make the sale.

QUINN: We actually have recordings of these calls, not from the place where Ryan worked, but from a different company, The Tax Club.

KESTENBAUM: We got the recordings from the Federal Trade Commission, which has been trying to shut these places down. This one set of calls stood out to us in particular.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DORIS: Hello?

QUINN: We don't know this woman's name. It's bleeped out. But I like to think of her as Doris.

KESTENBAUM: The man calling says his name is Blake Cantor (ph), sounds perfectly nice.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BLAKE CANTOR: How are you this morning?

DORIS: Oh, I'm doing all right. I was just cleaning up my grandson's bedroom.

CANTOR: Oh, yeah?

DORIS: (Laughter).

CANTOR: Never ends, right (laughter)?

DORIS: Yeah, well, he's 16, and he's spoiled.

CANTOR: Spoiled?

DORIS: Yep.

CANTOR: (Laughter) Aren't they all? Well, most of them anyway. But that's OK, grandmothers are supposed to spoil their grandchildren. That's how it works.

KESTENBAUM: We played these calls for Ryan, the guy who'd worked in some of the call centers, and he walked us through the whole thing. The salespeople, he says, they're all working off of a script. Script is a few pages long, and it lays out exactly how to make the sale.

QUINN: He says these scripts are basically works of art. They're honed over years, passed all around Utah. They laid out the most time-tested, most efficient way to get someone to eventually give you their credit card number.

KESTENBAUM: That's what they want, your credit card number.

JENSEN: And an expiration date and a CCV - that's the goal. That's the bell-ringer.

KESTENBAUM: We got our hands on one of these scripts, and it basically breaks the whole sale down into these different parts. The first part is just called the intro. The idea is to establish rapport. Ryan says everybody had their own ways of doing it.

JENSEN: We'd say, for example - does your wife know about this business? Is she going to be involved? If they said yes, then say OK. Is she available to get on the phone as well now? If not, let's reschedule this because obviously, I'm not a very good marriage counselor, and I don't want to get you in trouble.

KESTENBAUM: Did you get a chuckle of that line?

JENSEN: Yeah. Oh, they always love that line.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

QUINN: On the call with Blake and Doris, you can tell that Blake is using a script because there's this one moment where he messes up. One of Doris's answers comes unexpected, and he kind of trips up.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JENSEN: Have you ever set up an e-commerce business before?

DORIS: I did years ago.

CANTOR: OK. All right, listen. Don't worry. Most of - I mean, was it successful?

KESTENBAUM: Pay attention, Blake. It's a real person there.

After this, he just plows ahead. He goes on to the next part of the script, which is called the blast.

QUINN: The script for this part says ask find-out questions. Blake needs to figure out what Doris wants to do so he can figure out what to push on her.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: Do know what types of products you're going to be selling yet?

DORIS: I haven't done anything yet.

CANTOR: OK. All right.

DORIS: My laptop doesn't seem to do what I want it to do.

CANTOR: Right, right. It always works that way. Well, listen - you know, I'm going to guide you in getting your back end of your business set up so that you can - so that you can make as much money as possible as quickly as possible and save as much money as possible tax-wise, OK?

DORIS: That's good.

QUINN: Doris doesn't have a working computer or any idea what she wants to sell.

KESTENBAUM: Some people sold weight loss shakes or herbal supplements or skin cream, that kind of stuff.

QUINN: She has no idea, but Blake moves right on to the next part of the script. It's called the probe.

KESTENBAUM: The probe is this critical, delicate part of this whole pitch. Blake needs to figure out how much money she has so he can figure out how much he can get from her. He needs to probe her finances.

QUINN: Which seems like a hard thing to just turn a conversation to - so, how much money do you have? - but Blake finds a way in.

KESTENBAUM: This is just three minutes into the call.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: I don't know if you're aware of this, but 1 out of 3 Internet businesses are sued every year for one violation or another. Now, I just want to get an idea of what type of assets you have that we will protecting with this corporation. Are you a homeowner?

DORIS: Yep.

CANTOR: OK. You have a mortgage, I'm assuming.

DORIS: Yep.

CANTOR: OK. Do you own any vehicles?

DORIS: I have a van.

CANTOR: A van?

DORIS: Yeah.

CANTOR: OK. Is it a lease or...

DORIS: No. It's - I paid for that one.

CANTOR: OK. You own that.

QUINN: Ryan, the guy who used to work in these call centers, he says this part of the script made him feel super nervous.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. For him, this was all just very awkward. Remember, he was 20-something-years-old, and he thought, like - who am I to be advising these people? What do I know about money? I'm broke. But some of the salesmen there, he says, had no problem with this.

Were there some guys who, like, could almost always close a deal?

JENSEN: Yeah. Like, give me 10, 15 minutes, get a smoke break. I'll come back and hammer this down, so they just call after call after call - just what they do for a living. They enjoy it.

KESTENBAUM: How do they do that?

JENSEN: What makes them good is no fear. They don't - they're not afraid to talk about money. Because if you're afraid to talk about money on the phone, they're going to be afraid to talk about money. If you just act like yeah, $2,000. This is what it is. I guess you're broke. How many credit cards do you have? If you just talk to them normally, they'll feel more comfortable about it.

QUINN: Ryan says these salesmen would just be walking around the office, their headsets on. They'd putt a few golf balls while they're talking on the call.

KESTENBAUM: On this call we're listen to, Blake, the salesman, does exactly what Ryan says the pros do. He just plays it super casual, and Doris goes along with it. She tells him all these specific financial details. Like, she tells him for that mortgage that she owes about $200,000 on it.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: It's really not bad. I mean, I know a lot of people - I speak to people every day. I mean, I know people in much, much worse positions than you are. Do you have savings?

DORIS: Yeah, a little bit.

CANTOR: A little bit.

DORIS: Yeah. When my mother passed away, she gave us kids some, so I put it away.

CANTOR: OK, good. Just a ballpark if you had to say. I don't want an exact number. It's none of my business. I'm just...

DORIS: I'd say right around 50,000.

CANTOR: Fifty, OK. And you have working capital in your checking account?

DORIS: Yes.

CANTOR: Ballpark, what would you say that is?

DORIS: 2,000.

CANTOR: OK.

QUINN: You can almost hear Blake doing the math here, counting up how much money he can go after.

KESTENBAUM: At this point, Blake moves on to the next part of the script. And in the script that we have, what it says is find the pain - find the fear, basically. It is adamant about this. It says find more pain if needed. Everybody has pain. It is your job to find it.

QUINN: It's like this demented twist on the classic sales move. Convince the person that you have the solution to their problems.

So Blake manufactures a pain for Doris.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: This way, you don't have to deal with the IRS on your own. I don't know if you've ever dealt with them, but it's like dealing with the Gestapo.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan liked this part.

JENSEN: It's a fancy line (laughter). That's a fancy one-liner.

KESTENBAUM: You think he uses that a lot?

JENSEN: Absolutely. Absolutely he does.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: Now, how many hours a week do you think you're going to invest in this business?

DORIS: Five to eight hours a day.

CANTOR: Really? That's fantastic. OK - because investing as little as 10 hours a week, OK, can potentially generate a six-figure income. So I mean, as long as you dedicate...

DORIS: Maybe I'll get a seven.

(LAUGHTER)

CANTOR: Let's hope.

KESTENBAUM: Seven figures - that is $1 million. Doris is talking about working from home, like, half-time and hoping she's going to make $1 million.

QUINN: I've been thinking about why people fall for this. And when you're someone who's never done super great financially, it can seem kind of like magic how some people just make it.

KESTENBAUM: And here's this guy saying I know those secrets. I can tell them to you. It's going to be complicated, but together, we can do it.

QUINN: And 21 minutes and 45 seconds into the call, Blake goes for it. He goes in for the sell.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: Now look, our membership consists of a one-time initial setup fee and only a small corresponding retainer fee. So for that, everything that we've discussed here today, it's only a one-time investment of $4,785, OK, and $49.95 a month, which I will waive for the first 3 months.

DORIS: Forty-nine what?

CANTOR: Forty-nine ninety-five.

DORIS: Good thing I don't have to pay it all at once.

KESTENBAUM: To his credit, Blake is upfront here. No, he says, we are talking about you paying $4,785 upfront plus $49.95 a month.

QUINN: But he says you can write it off. He tries to get her to pay out of her checking account.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: I have everything in the system here set up. It would be very helpful to me if we can start the billing process.

DORIS: I can't do that because I don't have that much in there.

CANTOR: OK.

DORIS: I just maxed it out.

CANTOR: OK. What can you do? Is there anything you can do right this moment?

DORIS: No, not right now.

CANTOR: OK. That's fine. I'll just save everything here.

DORIS: Sorry to do that to you.

CANTOR: No, it's OK. It's all right.

QUINN: She apologizes to a guy who's trying to take her money.

KESTENBAUM: That's how good he is.

Blake makes one more attempt. He says just give me your debit card information now. You can put the money in it tomorrow.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CANTOR: All right. You're going to be using your debit card. Was that correct?

DORIS: Yeah.

CANTOR: Is that a Visa or a MasterCard?

DORIS: Visa.

CANTOR: A Visa, all right. What are those numbers?

DORIS: Oh, you're fast.

QUINN: You're fast, she tells him. And here's this moment where I'm like maybe she's caught on. Maybe there's something deep in her gut that is saying - no, this is not right. I was totally rooting for her. But then this happens.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DORIS: I got it. OK, the number is...

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)

CANTOR: Expiration?

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEPS)

CANTOR: OK, and the three-digit CVV number on the back?

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)

KESTENBAUM: Ryan, the guy who worked in the call centers, told us that if you are the salesperson and you get to this point, you are psyched.

JENSEN: He's doing a dance in his chair right there. He got 16 digits, a CCV and an expiration date.

QUINN: From a woman he'd never met. All he'd done was spend 35 minutes with her on the phone.

KESTENBAUM: And she did transfer the money into her account that she promised. She paid the $4,785 membership fee.

QUINN: The salesman, Blake, he would have made 10 to 20 percent of that. That's as much as $1,000 for one call.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan told us he made less from the stuff that he was selling, but he was right out of college, and it felt like easy money.

What was the story that you told yourself to make yourself feel OK about it?

JENSEN: Just trying to make a living like everyone else.

KESTENBAUM: But like, just reading through the script that we have here - I don't how different...

JENSEN: Sure.

KESTENBAUM: ...Yours was. It feels awfully manipulative. You know, it's thousands of dollars...

JENSEN: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: ...For people who, like, do not have it. And if you just think about it for a second, the idea that they're going to be able to set up a website and make, like, a $100,000 a year selling whatever, it just seems impossible, you know? Like...

JENSEN: You're right.

KESTENBAUM: Did you feel that way?

JENSEN: You're absolutely right.

KESTENBAUM: Did you feel that way at the time?

JENSEN: You know, I was a little bit young, a little bit naive. I mean, I'd have to completely say - I mean, I wasn't completely, completely oblivious to it. I mean, you question at times a little bit. You do feel a little, you know, aggressive, and eventually, that feeling wears off. I mean, it's a sale at the end of the day is what you end up thinking. A sale is a sale is a sale.

QUINN: And once you make a sale, that is not the end because once someone has shown they're willing to buy something, you can probably get them to buy more.

KESTENBAUM: After Doris had that call with Blake from The Tax Club, she gets what is supposed to be her first support call to help her get started. It's a different salesman this time.

QUINN: And this new salesman, he pushes her further. And this gets us to some of the craftiest few lines in this whole set of calls.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Have you done anything in regards to getting a loan for the business?

DORIS: No, because I don't really want to go into more debt.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Well, no, it's not exactly about going more into debt. What I would rather see you do is take the money you've already invested and kind of, like, pay it off with the loan, just so the business would actually claim those liabilities. So it'd be like paying yourself back with a business loan. Does that make sense? So you're really not borrowing any more money. You're just kind of paying off what you've already invested. Does that sound better?

DORIS: But it has to be paid back, too.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I can't hear you. What'd you say?

DORIS: I said it would still have to be paid back.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Well, it's the same exact situation you're in now, isn't it? Think of the difference. What's the difference?

KESTENBAUM: You know, there's this moment in there where she has correctly identified the flaw in his logic.

QUINN: And you're, like, go, Doris.

KESTENBAUM: And then he just does this math mind trick, and he steamrolls over her.

QUINN: This part is horrible. It's like listening to someone get beat up. She does eventually take out a loan.

KESTENBAUM: Which is more money they can go after.

QUINN: And at the end of this call, he gets another 16 digits from her. They charge her $4,000, and this is not the last call on Doris's file.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan Jensen, our guide for all this, says that he eventually started running his own call center. He told us he was trying to run a legitimate business, actually give people a shot at setting up a website and being able to sell stuff online. But a lot of the coaching and services he was selling, they were provided by other companies. And at some point, it started becoming pretty clear that those products were not very good.

QUINN: His customers were being passed from company to company, just getting sold more and more stuff.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan remembers this one call with a customer, in particular, that kind of changed things for him.

JENSEN: So I sell this guy, you know, four or five grand in coaching to build him a website and do what-not and coaching. Well, after that, he goes to The Tax Club and spends another, hell, $16,000. So this guy calls us back because we were his main point of contact, and he calls us back and he's like, I just spent all this money on a business. It's not bringing any income. And he's crying. I mean, he spent $24,000. He's on speaker crying to us. You know, I mean, when you have somebody that's calling you back broke, $24,000 later with nothing to show for it, I mean, it hits some chords. I mean, it hit some chords.

KESTENBAUM: If you're wondering how these call centers can just keep operating, it's worth pointing out that they have pretty strong political connections. Ryan's call center was based in Utah, and a lot of these call centers are in Utah, where there has not been much of a crackdown.

QUINN: The call centers there have made some pretty major campaign contributions. Two recent attorneys general have been charged with bribery in connection with the call centers.

KESTENBAUM: The lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission say trying to go after these companies is a bit like playing whack-a-mole. Once enough customers complain, the company just shuts down and opens up under a new name.

QUINN: The Tax Club, the company you've been hearing from on those calls with Doris, they did actually get shut down for practicing deceptive sales tactics.

KESTENBAUM: That is why we have recordings of the phone calls.

QUINN: According to legal filings, The Tax Club took in over $220 million from people.

KESTENBAUM: There is just one more phone call in Doris's file, and it's a rough one. It is from someone calling on her behalf to a financing company that The Tax Club had set Doris up with.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CAESAR: (Unintelligible) Financing, this is Caesar (ph).

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah, Caesar. I've been trying to get a hold of you.

CAESAR: Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Forever.

CAESAR: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Forever. Are you at your desk?

CAESAR: I am.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: OK, fine. You have a few minutes?

CAESAR: I do. How can I help out here?

QUINN: The woman says she's trying to track down a loan that Doris took out for another home business program.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: This loan has to be zeroed out, for one.

CAESAR: OK. And why is that?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Well, because (beep) passed away right after she signed that contract.

CAESAR: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. All right.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We had to put a freeze on all of her bank accounts and stuff because money has been flying out of there left and right.

CAESAR: OK. And just for your records, I'm sending an email right now. She had two accounts. I have a hard time explaining this. You want me to hold on and get an explanation for you?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: No, I just want to know where, like, $45,000 went towards these people. It's been coming out of her account, and it started all in August. And it was going to something, The Tax Club Global web something or another.

CAESAR: A lot of those guys are building, you know, online businesses or storefronts, and so those services help them either run their business or help them do their taxes.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Laughter) This is a woman who had dementia, 75 years old and could barely turn on a computer.

KESTENBAUM: The man on the phone agrees to refund the money to Doris's estate. We do not know if she got anything back. The FTC is still sorting through the mess. Something like 20,000 people said they had been ripped off by The Tax Club. That's from a four-year period.

QUINN: Ryan Jensen, the call center guy we talked to, he was eventually fined $400,000 by the state of Utah. So far, he's paid about 5,000 of it.

KESTENBAUM: Ryan says he's trying to speak out about all the corruption in the call center industry. We asked him if he felt bad about his role in everything. Here's what he said.

JENSEN: I mean, that's something that, hopefully, I can learn from. And you know, I will learn from, you know. Now's my chance to apologize if I did hurt anyone, and I'm more than happy to try to make that right.

KESTENBAUM: He says if anyone thinks he steered them wrong, get in touch. He'll do what he can.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "JUST ANOTHER STORY")

UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: (Singing) The room was spinning, so I did the same. She was about to leave, but it was a turning point.

KESTENBAUM: We should say we tried to reach out to all the people you heard in those recorded phone calls.

QUINN: We asked the FTC to put us in touch with Doris's family. They said they couldn't for privacy reasons.

KESTENBAUM: And we tried to reach the salesmen, at least by the names they gave in those recordings. No one returned our calls. Our show today was produced by Jess Jiang.

QUINN: Special thanks goes to Jason Jones. He provided us with the call center script. And to Christine Durst, she runs a scam-spotting site.

KESTENBAUM: It's called RatRaceRebellion.

I would have been on the phone. I would have been the first call you would have received
This is Ryan Jensen in 2007
He had just graduated from college in st. George, Utah
He was looking for a job a friend of his suggested he come to work with him at this call center
The call center industry is big in Utah
His friend takes him to this non-descript office park at the edge of town when you first walk in
There's a secretary sitting there. They just had a couch out front
I mean they had a picture maybe a plan out and then they just lead your own back into the
Call floor there are about 30 guys back there on the call floor
They actually called it the bullpen everyone sitting in cubicles with headsets on Ryan's call center offered all types of packages
Most of them were to help you sell stuff online you want to set up a website they can build it for you
They'll coach you on how to run a web business handle all the paperwork the accounting Ryan says the pitch was this is the internet
It's huge. You can sell to the whole world. I didn't really understand the online world too much back then
I mean I was the guy that played football and hated computers
You know back then you think
Yeah, they're going to a great coaching company. They're gonna get a website and they're gonna learn how to sell online
This is great. There were some red flags
Sometimes he'd get to the office and find white powder on his desk turned out to be residue from people snorting Oxycontin
Ryan's job was to call people who had responded to one of those work from home ads and
Try to convince them that he had a very special offer try to make the sale
We actually have recordings of these calls not from the place where Ryan worked
But from a different company the tax club
We got the recordings from the Federal Trade Commission, which has been trying to shut these places down
This one set of calls stood out to us in particular
Hello, we don't know this woman's name
It's bleeped out, but I like to think of her as Doris the man calling says his name is Blake Cantor
Sounds perfectly nice. How are you this morning? I'm doing all right. I was just cleaning up my grandson's bedroom. Oh, yeah
Never ends, right?
Well, he's 16 and
He's spoiled spoiled. Yep
Aren't they all most of them anyway, but that's okay. Grandmothers are supposed to spoil their grandchildren
That works
We played these calls for Ryan the guy who'd worked in some of the call centers and he walked us through the whole thing
The sales people he says they're all working off of a script script is a few pages long and it lays out exactly
How to make the sale he says these scripts are basically works of art
They're honed over years passed all around, Utah
They laid out the most time-tested most efficient way to get someone to eventually give you their credit card number
That's what they want your credit card number and an expiration date and a ccv
That's the girl. That's the that's the bell ringer
We got our hands on one of these scripts and it basically breaks the whole sale down into these different parts
The first part is just called the intro. The idea is to establish rapport
Ryan says everybody had their own ways of doing it. We'd say for example
Does your wife know about this business?
Is she going to be involved if they said yes, then say, okay
Is she available get on the phone as well now if not, let's reschedule this because obviously
I'm not a very good marriage counselor and I don't want to get you in trouble. Did you get a chuckle out of that line?
Yeah
Oh, they always love that line
On the call with blake and doris
You can tell that blake is using a script because there's this one moment where he messes up
When the doris's answers comes unexpected and he kind of trips up. Um, have you ever set up an e-commerce business before?
Um, I did years ago
Okay. All right. Listen, don't worry most of us. I mean was it successful
Pay attention blake. It's a real person there
After this he just plows ahead he goes on to the next part of the script which is called the blast
The script for this part says ask find out questions blake needs to figure out what doris wants to do
So he can figure out what to push on her. Do you know what types of products you're going to be selling yet?
um
I haven't done anything yet. Okay. All right. My laptop doesn't seem to do what I want it to do. Right, right
It's it always works that way. Well, listen, i'm going to you know
I'm going to guide you in getting your back end of your business set up so that you can
Um so that you can make as much money as possible as quickly as possible
And save as much money as possible tax wise, okay, that's good
Doris doesn't have a working computer or any idea what she wants to sell some people sold weight loss shakes or herbal
Supplements or skin cream that kind of stuff. She has no idea but blake moves right on to the next part of the script
It's called the probe. The probe is this critical delicate part of this whole pitch
Blake needs to figure out how much money she has so he can figure out how much he can get from her
He needs to probe her finances which seems like a hard thing to just turn a conversation to so
How much money do you have but blake finds a way in this is just three minutes into the call
I don't know if you're aware of this, but one out of three internet businesses are sued every year
for one violation or another
Now I just want to get an idea of what type of assets you have that we will be protecting with this corporation
Are you a homeowner? Yep. Okay. You have a mortgage i'm assuming. Yep
Do you own any vehicles? I have a van a van. Yeah, okay. Is it a lease or no it's
Paid for that one. Okay own that
Ryan the guy who used to work in these call centers
He says this part of the script made him feel super nervous
Yeah for him. This was all just very awkward
Remember he was 20 something years old and he thought like who am I to be advising these people?
What do I know about money? I'm broke but some of the salesmen there he says had no problem with this
Were there some guys who like could almost always close a deal? Yeah, like give me 10 15 minutes
Get a smoke break. I'll come back and hammer this down. So they just call after call after call. It's just what they do for a living
They enjoy it. How do they do that? What makes them good is no fear
They don't they're not afraid to talk about money because if you're afraid to talk about money on the phone
They're going to be afraid to talk about money. If you just act like
Yeah, two thousand dollars. This is what it is where I guess you're broke
Where how many credit cards do you have that if if you just talk to them normally?
They'll feel more comfortable about it
Ryan says these salesmen would just be walking around the office their headsets on
They'd put a few golf balls while they're talking on the call on this call
We're listening to blake the salesman does exactly what ryan says the pros do
He just plays it super casual and doris goes along with it
She tells him all these specific financial details like she tells him for that mortgage that she owes about two hundred thousand dollars on it
It's really not bad
I mean, I know a lot of people I speak to people every day and then I mean
I know people in much much worse positions than you are. Do you have savings?
Uh, yeah a little bit a little bit. Um
Yeah, when my mother passed away
She gave us kids some so I put it away
Okay, good just a ballpark if you had to say I don't want an exact number none of my business i'm just
No, i'd say right around fifty thousand fifty. Okay
And you have working capital in your checking account. Yeah ballpark. What would you say that is?
2000 okay
You can almost hear blake doing the math here counting up how much money he can go after
At this point blake moves on to the next part of the script and in the script that we have
What it says is find the pain find the fear basically it is adamant about this
It says find more pain if needed everybody has pain. It is your job to find it
It's like this demented twist on the classic sales move convince the person that you have the solution to their problems
So blake manufactures a pain for doris this way. You don't have to deal with the irs on your own
I don't know if you've ever dealt with them, but it's like dealing with the gestapo. Ryan liked this part
It's a fancy line
That's a fancy one-liner. You think you think he uses that a lot
Absolutely. Absolutely. He does now
How many hours a week do you think you're going to invest into this business five to eight hours a day?
Really? That's fantastic. Okay, because investing as little as 10 hours a week
Okay can potentially generate a six figure income. So I mean as long as you dedicate maybe i'll get a seven
Let's let's hope seven figures that is a million dollars doris is talking about working from home like
Halftime and hoping she's going to make a million dollars
I've been thinking about why people fall for this and when you're someone who's never done super great financially
It can seem kind of like magic how some people just make it
And here's this guy saying I know those secrets I can tell them to you
It's going to be complicated but together we can do it and 21 minutes and 45 seconds into the call
Blake goes for it. He goes in for the sell now
Look our membership consists of a one-time initial setup fee and only a small corresponding retainer fee
So for that everything that we've discussed here today. It's only a one-time investment of
4785 dollars, okay
And forty nine dollars and ninety five a month, which I will waive for the first three months
49 what?
49.95
Now I think I don't have to pay it all once
To his credit Blake is up front here. No, he says we are talking about you paying
4785 dollars up front plus 49.95 a month
He says you can write it off. He tries to get her to pay out of a checking account
I have everything in the system here set up. It would be very helpful to me if um
we can
Start the uh the billing process. I can't do that because I don't have that much in there
Okay, what I just I just maxed it out. Okay. What can you do? Is there anything you could do right this moment?
No, not right now. Okay, that's fine. I'll just save everything here
Sorry to do that to you. No, it's okay. It's all right
She apologizes to a guy who's trying to take her money. That's how good he is
Blake makes one more attempt. He says just give me your debit card information
Now you can put the money in it tomorrow
All right, you're gonna be using your debit card. Was that correct? Yeah, is that a visa or a master card?
Visa a visa
All right. What are those numbers?
You're fast
You're fast. She tells him and here's this moment where I'm like, maybe she's caught on
Maybe there's something deep in her gut that is saying no, this is not right
I was totally rooting for her. But then this happens
I got it
Okay, the number
Is
Expiration okay in the three-digit cvv number on the back
Ryan the guy who worked in the call centers told us that if you are the salesperson you get to this point
You are psyched. He's doing a dance in his chair right there. He uh, he got 16 digits
Uh ccv and an expiration date from a woman he never met
All he'd done was spend 35 minutes with her on the phone and she did transfer the money into her account that she'd promised
She paid the four thousand seven hundred and eighty five dollar membership fee the salesman blake
He would have made 10 to 20 percent of that. That's as much as a thousand dollars for one call
Ryan told us he made less from the stuff that he was selling but he was right out of college
And it felt like easy money. What was the story that you told yourself to make yourself feel okay about it?
Just trying to make a living like everyone else
but like
just reading through the
Script that we have here and I don't know how different yours was
Uh, it feels awfully manipulative, you know
It's thousands of dollars for people who like do not have it
And if you just think about it for a second the idea that they're going to be able to set up a website
And make like a hundred thousand dollars a year selling whatever it just seems impossible
You know, like did you feel that way? You're absolutely right. Did you feel that way at the time?
You know, I was a little bit young a little bit naive. I mean i'd have to
Completely say I mean I wasn't completely completely oblivious to it
I mean you question at times a little bit you do feel a little
You know aggressive
Um, and eventually that that feeling wears off
I mean, it's a sale at the end of the day is what you end up thinking
Sell is a sell is a sell and once you make a sale
That is not the end because once someone has shown they're willing to buy something
You can probably get them to buy more after doris had that call with blake from the tax club
She gets what is supposed to be her first support call to help her get started
It's a different salesman this time and this new salesman
He pushes her further and this gets us to some of the craftiest few lines in this whole set of calls
I mean, have you done anything in regards to getting a loan for the business?
No, because I don't really want to go into more debt
Well, no, it's not exactly about going more into debt
What I would rather see you do is take the money you've already invested
And kind of like pay it off with the loan just so the business would actually claim those liabilities
So it'd be like paying yourself back with a business loan. Does that make sense?
So you're really not borrowing any more money. You're just kind of paying off what you've already invested
Does that sound better?
But it's got to be paid back too
I can't hear you. What'd you say? I said it would still have to be paid back
What's the same exact situation you're in now, isn't it?
Take it to the difference
What's the difference?
You know, there's this moment in there where she has correctly identified the flaw in his logic
And you're like go Doris and he just does this math mind trick and he steamrolls over her. This part is horrible
It's like listening to someone get beat up. She does eventually take out a loan
Which is more money they can go after and at the end of this call he gets another 16 digits from her
They charged her four thousand dollars and this is not the last call on Doris's file
Ryan Jensen our guide for all this says that he eventually started running his own call center
He told us he was trying to run a legitimate business actually give people a shot at setting up a website and being able to
Sell stuff online
But a lot of the coaching and services he was selling they were provided by other companies
And at some point it started becoming pretty clear that those products were not very good
His customers were being passed from company to company just getting sold more and more stuff
Ryan remembers this one call with a customer in particular. They kind of changed things for him
So I sell this guy, you know
Four or five grand in coaching to build him a website and do do whatnot and coaching
well
After that he goes to the tax club and spends another
hell
$16,000
so
This guy calls us back because we were his main point of contact and he calls us back and he's like
I just spent all this money on a business that's not bringing any income and he's crying
I mean, he spent twenty four thousand dollars. He's on speaker crying to us
You know, I mean when you have somebody that's calling you back broke
$24,000 later with nothing to show for it. I mean it hits some cords. I mean it hits some cords
If you're wondering how these call centers can just keep operating
It's worth pointing out that they have pretty strong political connections
Ryan's call center was based in utah
And a lot of these call centers are in utah where there has not been much of a crackdown
The call centers there have made some pretty major campaign contributions
Two recent attorneys general have been charged with bribery in connection with the call centers
The lawyers at the federal trade commission say trying to go after these companies is a bit like playing whack-a-mole
Once enough customers complain
The company just shuts down and opens up under a new name
The tax club the company you've been hearing from on those calls with doris they did actually get shut down
For practicing deceptive sales tactics. That is why we have recordings of the phone calls according to legal filings
The tax club took in over two hundred and twenty million dollars from people
There's just one more phone call in doris's file and it's a rough one
It is from someone calling on her behalf to a financing company that the tax club had set doris up with
Yeah, caesar i've been trying to get a hold of you yes forever
Okay
Forever. Are you at your desk? I am
Okay, fine. You got a few minutes. I do how can I how can I help out here?
The woman says she's trying to track down a loan that doris took out for another home business program
this
loan
Has to be zeroed out for one
Okay
And why is that?
Well, because passed away. Okay right after she signed that contract. Oh, i'm sorry to hear that
All right
We've had to put a freeze on all of her bank accounts and stuff because money has been flying out of their left and right
Okay, and just just for your records
Um i'm sending an email right now. She had two accounts
Like I have a hard time explaining if you wanted me to hold on and get an explanation for you
No, I just want to know where like forty five thousand dollars went towards these people
Um
That's been coming out of her account and it started all in august and it was going to something the tax club global
uh
Web
Something or another a lot of those clients are building either online businesses or storefronts
And so those services help them either run their business or help them do their taxes
This is a woman who had dementia 75 years old and could barely turn on her computer
The man on the phone agrees to refund the money to doris's estate
We do not know if she got anything back. The fdc is still sorting through the mess
Something like 20 000 people said they had been ripped off by the tax club. That's from a four-year period
Ryan jensen the call center guy we talked to he was eventually fined
400 000 by the state of utah so far he's paid about 5 000 of it
Ryan says he's trying to speak out about all the corruption in the call center industry
We asked him if he felt bad about his role in everything
Here's what he said. I mean that's something
That hopefully I can learn from and you know
I will learn from you know
Now's my chance to apologize if I did hurt anyone and i'm more than happy to try to make that right
He says if anyone thinks he steered them wrong get in touch. He'll do what he can
We should say we tried to reach out to all the people you heard in those recorded phone calls
We asked the ftc to put us in touch with doris's family
They said they couldn't for privacy reasons and we tried to reach the salesman at least by the names they gave in
Those recordings, uh, no one returned our calls our show today was produced by jess jang special
