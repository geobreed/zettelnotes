On today's Planet Money:

-- U.S. unemployment hit 8.1 percent in February — unless you count the underemployed, too, in which case it's 14.8. Economist Howard Rosen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics takes your questions about the real picture, COBRA, and which industries might be hit next.

-- Look, the economy is bad. It's even very bad. But if you gaze across the span of history, says economist Ken Rogoff of Harvard, this particular crisis starts to seem not so unusual after all. Rogoff talks about the ideas behind his paper, "This Time Is Different: A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises."

-- And seriously, the economy could be worseverse. That's what Planet Money editor Jonathan Kern tells us, in his villanelle for the economic crisis.

Bonus: After the jump, extra questions and answers from Howard Rosen, plus the full text of "Villanelle for Uncertain Times" by Jonathan Kern.

Thanks to everyone who sent us questions about employment over Twitter. Howard Rosen took more than we could use on the podcast. I've collected extras in the MP3 below.

@AndiVanderKolk's, included below, wins the prize for question from which I personally learned the most.

Howard Rosen's bonus Twitter questions:

Villanelle for Uncertain Times

Though banks are suffering a lack of liquidity
And teeter on the edge of nationalization,
Do not succumb to economic stupidity.

Though Congress is demanding more rapidity
And tugs the strings behind the Administration,
Keep at bay financial rigidity.

The credit markets all crave liquidity
And Wall Streeters contemplate defenestration.
Do not succumb to economic stupidity.

While Keynsians say the budget reeks of tepidity
And scorn what's left of privatization,
Keep at bay financial rigidity.

Zealots always demand philosophical solidity.
Hasty action always trumps contemplation.
Do not succumb to economic stupidity.

Human nature involves some cupidity.
Self interest is the market's salvation.
Keep at bay financial rigidity.
Do not succumb to economic stupidity.

**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**

We've only had maybe 10 months where we've lost 500,000 jobs or more in the history of our series since
1940 this is four of the ten all in a row
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Laura Conaway in New York, and I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington DC. Today is Friday, March 6th
2009 in case any of you are waiting to listen to these until the crisis is over
Yeah, we are not there yet in a big way
The new unemployment numbers came out today and our Planet Money indicator is 8.1
8.1 percent unemployment rate in the United States. That's the worst since 300 BC
When Athena got laid off. No, it's the worst since 1983 though
You just heard Commissioner Keith Hall of the Bureau of Labor Statistics at the top there on today's show
We're gonna take your questions about the unemployment numbers
We're gonna hear from an economist who says hey, it could be worse and from an editor who says it could be verse
Do not succumb to economic stupidity. That is such a bad pun. We'll have to use it again in the podcast
Later yeah first the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Yes indeed put out a raft a whole bunch of employment numbers
It revised the jobless rates for the last couple of months generally in the direction of misery
Since the start of the recession the economy has lost
4.4 million jobs. We turn to an economist who really really swims around in employment data
His name is Howard Rosen
He's with the Peterson Institute for International Economics and he paints the jobs picture like this
Today we learned that there are twelve and a half million unemployed people in the country twelve and a half million and
Because the unemployment rate tends to you know, it tends to camouflage. What does it really mean twelve and a half million people?
That's you know, the population of several states in this country and that we have another
8.6 million people who are working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs. So you're up over 20 million people
That's exactly right. That's my point
Which is now you're talking about 20 million people in this country who are either unemployed or under employed
And now the number the unemployed number
I don't want to you know kind of freak out people but the unemployment rate then starts we start talking about 15 16 percent
All right, and and that becomes I know and that becomes much more real because you know
People are listening to these numbers and they say, you know 8 percent that you know
You know doesn't sound really right
But when you start talking about 15 to 16 percent and they know that a lot of their friends are being affected
Then you know, it starts it starts sounding real
Yeah, it's just like a lot of people who could be doing something who aren't yeah
They're just kind of hanging around waiting for the next thing these unemployment numbers David
I find that they raise a million questions for me probably for other people
So we gave the planet money crowd a chance to ask theirs over Twitter our handle
No surprise is planet money and we're calling this segment Twitter questions
Howard Rosen climbed into the nest to take really a slew of questions from you guys
Maple fan what job sector will suffer layoffs next
Next
Well what we've been seeing and and we saw today is that you know, the financial markets are getting hit very hard
Manufacturing has already been under a lot of a lot of pressure
So, you know you start seeing that I think the next thing what we'll start seeing is what I would call the tertiary industries
these are the restaurants the kind of
Personal services and leisure and those kinds of things the travel industry
When people don't have money over the summer to go, you know traveling or the local restaurant
Or those kinds of things that are I don't want to say they're luxuries, but they're not the primary expenditures
And so I think that's what I'm just gonna say a lot of those that job for me
That's always been sort of like well, I can always wait tables and what you're saying is well, maybe not
Correct we're already hearing that the fast-food places
McDonald's and all those where people felt that that was the fallback that they're already cutting back
No, tafflinger. Do layoffs really indicate that we're nearing the end of a recession
Well, it's a very good question because
This is this has been changing over the last as I mentioned before over the last 30 40 years
It used to be that unemployment was a leading indicator of economic slowdown
Which meant that people started laying off their workers first and that
Told us that we were getting into an economic slowdown and that was primarily because workers were expendable
You know, you just that's the first cost that you get rid of now what we've been seeing within the last 20 years
Is that unemployment has become a lagging indicator?
So so what happens is the economy starts turning down and only then does the unemployment start going up
So for example, I mean here's a great example where the economy declined
You know a real lot in the second half of last year, but the unemployment rate is only really ratcheting up right now
I mean, you know, of course it was increasing but five six percent, you know
It's not the end of the world
but when you start getting into the eight nine percent realm then that's really serious so and here we are six months after the
beginning of the of the downturn, but again what I want to emphasize is that lag is
Goes through the whole cycle. So
Unemployment lags the economic downturn and the recovery of employment also lags the recovery of the economy
This is from someone in Ohio, which of course is a very diverse state. It's got big cities
It's got wide swaths of rural counties
Olivia asks is there any significant difference between rural and urban unemployment and which will recover first?
Another great question. Yes, there are profound differences. And again, it's on the upside
It's very hard to create jobs in rural areas
And you know, you either have to you know, you have to attract new companies
And it's very very difficult
And so what we tend to see first of all, we tend to see higher unemployment rates in rural areas than urban areas
but the stickiness of
The improvement or the recovery in employment is also much worse in the rural areas than it is in the urban areas
Again, we see this every day you walk down the street in urban areas and you see stores opening and closing and opening and closing
So there's a lot of that kind of turnover that goes on that doesn't happen in rural areas
And so that's a big problem for those areas
Okay, this one is tough for me Howard. I don't understand it, but maybe you will okay. Okay, it's from sell the kids
Explain the difference between you three you six, etc
Goodness, so we get a real picture of unemployment. The official numbers are not the whole truth
so you three it sounds like a band is
Is the basic unemployment rate that we know eight point one percent
You six is if you take all these other things that we talked about what we call marginally attached workers
Those workers who are working part-time because they can't find a full-time job
Those people who are entering the labor market and can't find unemployment
You know, we don't count those people because they're not in the labor market, right?
Let's say that you had a child and you're coming back into the labor market and you can't find a job
You don't get counted because you weren't in the labor market before
So these are what we call marginally attached workers and
This month that number is estimated to be 15 percent, which was what I said to you before
So I'm not that far off. I said somewhere between 15 16. So it was 15 percent
So the point being is that we the press sorry
But you know the new, you know
We tend to focus on this unemployment number when in fact the effect on people can be almost twice as large
Lane Montgomery wants to know what's being done to make Cobra more affordable Cobra
Of course is the plan where if you lose health insurance by virtue of losing your job or even leaving your job
You can pay some money to keep it going, right?
So if you are eligible for Cobra
You can get your you can maintain your health insurance for 18 months and under the stimulus package
And you and as you maintain it for 18 months, you must pay the employer and the employee
Parts of the cost of the premiums
And under the stimulus package you can get a 65 percent. It's actually a tax
rebate
Or otherwise known as a subsidy on the amount that out of pocket that you have to pay to maintain your health insurance
Under Cobra for only 18 months. Okay, and this is one that I think is near and dear to your heart. Howard
josh zeal
Doesn't extending unemployment give discouraged workers less motivation to seek a job wouldn't they wait for the best situation?
Okay, so we know the conventional wisdom is that if you give people you pay people some money
That they're not going to work that and they're going to sit at home watch tv and you know, just
Kind of leisurely look for a new job. That's the conventional wisdom. There is no empirical evidence that that's the truth
Um, we there there is just no research that finds
That people here in the united states on the u.s. Unemployment insurance system
That if they receive money that it prolongs their unemployment
Now that that's the first thing on the research on the second
The average amount that we pay people that they receive the average weekly benefit
Is two hundred and ninety dollars a week. Now again, this is the average across the country
Um, but that that obviously, uh, you know kind of goes up and down based on what state you're in if you're in alabama
The average is closer to two hundred dollars
In alaska, it's two hundred dollars
um
One of the ones I thought was interesting was in louisiana. It's two hundred dollars and this is a governor
Governor jindal as we heard last week who does not want to accept federal money to expand unemployment insurance
And that's two hundred dollars a week again two hundred dollars a week
So now what that is that's basic, you know, that adds up to eight hundred dollars a month
And what I found I looked at the average
consumption patterns amongst people again
This isn't for the state of louisiana
But it's for people across the country and we find that if we just add up what people pay on housing and food
and uh utilities just the basic things that they need it comes to about for a family of four
Let's say it comes to about a thousand dollars a month
So already people's unemployment insurance is not is not going to help them meet just their basic needs. All right historical question last one
Mware
1205 for comparison. What is the real level of unemployment using methods of the 1930s?
Not our lipstick on pig method now
So interesting. It's another interesting thing. Uh, just this morning
I pulled down the data from the department of labor
You can go to the bureau of labor statistics database and they in fact have unemployment numbers that have been adjusted
going back to
1930s 1939
um
And i'm looking here so I can tell you
Let's say 19. Here's one in
1949 the unemployment rate was seven point nine percent
Um, so so they they do have those data. They are adjusted
So we can tell what the unemployment rates are, but i'm going to give a more sophisticated answer which is um
Where I think you're uh, where your twitter is is getting to
There are changes in the economy
in the labor market
That haven't been
That need to be taken into account when you're comparing unemployment rates and i'll give you an example
And this is a primary example
which is
people in prison
Or in or in probation and things like that
Um, we just got the statistics last week that suggested that something like one in ten
Americans are in the system either in prison or coming out of prison
In probation or something like that
Well, those people aren't working
And we don't count them in our unemployment unemployment numbers
So, uh
You could argue that our unemployment rate is really nine percent because if you count the people who are in prison who aren't working
They're they're also, you know included but we don't do that in the united states and what's interesting is we have
Many more people and certainly as a percentage of population a higher percentage of population in prison
Then then almost every other all other countries certainly the european countries and therefore
They the europeans argue that's why their unemployment rates are higher than ours
Because they use a different method to count. They use a different method. The other thing is in the united states
We have ours is a two-pronged method. We say were you working in the previous week?
And are you seeking employment?
And you have to meet both tests in the united states to be counted
In other countries, they primarily just ask where you unemployed
And don't really ask the seeking question. So again, that's why
Numbers are much higher in europe unemployment
I mean we estimate that they're probably about a percent percentage point difference because of that
But there are differences now
I use this as an opportunity to explain this it doesn't really answer your twitter's question because he's asking today versus the past
but I think this this issue of people in the
You know in the criminal system that that's an example where that's increased, you know
Exponentially over the last 50 years 60 years
And so that would make the unemployment rates different than they were then one last bit david from howard rosen
It's an indicator
It's the amount of time a laid-off person can expect to spend looking for a new job
And howard rosen says it has been going up with each recession
I have no idea what I mean i'm trying to guess. I don't really know what it would be. How long is it?
Well in the 1992 recession rosen says the average laid-off person got a new gig in about 12 or 13 weeks
In 2001 it was more like 15 weeks and what about today 19 or 20. Wow
So if you're laid off today, he says don't be surprised if you stay laid off for five months six months
even more
Folks, I am sorry that we don't have any better news. Yeah, we're trying now. We're trying that today when that unemployment number comes out
It's just it's not really fun, but we are looking for good news. We've told you this and we have found
one piece
Sort of it's an upcoming book that uh reminded me that as bad as things seem now
We've actually been here before or someplace like here
I talked with ken rogoff an economist at harvard. He's one of the authors and the book has sort of a wry title
so the book is uh
Reinhardt and rogoff my co-authors carmen reinhardt and it's uh called this time is different
Eight centuries of financial uh folly so that the title means that every time we have some financial crisis
We say oh, it's different. It's different and we're going to learn from it. But
Maybe it's actually it's actually about in the run-up when things look great
That we tell ourselves not to worry and especially our policymakers tell us not to worry
In the case of the united states there were u.s. Treasury secretaries
federal reserve chairman like alan greenspan saying
Don't worry that the u.s. Is borrowing seven or eight hundred billion dollars here. Don't worry that housing prices are soaring
Don't worry that consumers
used to have debt to income of
80 90 percent now it's 130 percent. These aren't a problem. We have financial globalization
We have better monetary policy just don't worry and each time people
Try to convince themselves that it's not going to happen here
And of course it always does that that's really what the theme is
Yeah, so what and what does the survey of 800 years? Is that what you said?
What does that tell us about the crisis that we're in now? I mean
Does it give you any insight any particular insight about how long it's going to be or yeah it does
I mean so what we find
What reinhardt and I find is that in many ways the united states is going down the tracks
Of a typical deep financial crisis not just qualitatively, but quantitatively looking at things like unemployment
Income the trade balance and especially what's happened to housing prices and equity prices
It's really quite remarkable
You can draw a graph of the run-up of housing prices and the collapse in the u.s
And it seems to trace out what happened in other countries that have experienced deep financial crises
So it does tell us something. I don't know if it's going to cheer you up to hear what it tells us
It tells me I don't know if that's comforting or alarming
Well, I mean, uh, it it tells us that deep financial crises last quite a while
the recession
Probably, you know will last
At least to the end of 2009 and may be well beyond that
But even if even if it ends at the end of this year the beginning of next year
Unemployment is likely to continue to rise into double digits 11 or 12 percent
And the most striking finding we have is that in the wake of financial crises
Government debt public debt soars and i'm not talking by 10 or 15 percent
The the average is 85 percent. So in the case of the united states eight and a half trillion dollars after three years
And we're we're unfortunately very much on track to achieve that a lot of that comes because tax revenues fall and output collapses
Some of it's the bailout costs which we're choking over at the moment
but a lot of it comes from the collateral damage of the recession I do find this sort of comforting because
You know, it's easy to think like
You know, we're on the edge of armageddon. What you're telling me is no we've been here before
That's exactly right. So there are 800 years of financial crises and so far
Everyone has ended now occasionally a country's lost its sovereignty at the end of it as newfoundland newfoundland did
In the depression, but you know more or less everyone has ended some of them have lasted longer than others
But no, uh, we're not on the edge of armageddon
You told me last time we talked the another characteristic of recessions is that in the middle of them
They never ever feel like they're going to end
Well, that's absolutely the case. I mean, uh economists tend to believe that things eventually go back to normal
So when we're in a boom, we all sound very pessimistic economists are very gloomy
But when we're in a deep recession like this
we're the optimists because
We've you know looked at history looked at the data and we know these things and
But you talk to lay people or frankly people in financial markets right now
And you know, they think this is going to be five times worse than the great depression and we're certainly not there yet
Certainly not there yet. See it could be worse
Yeah, all right, it could be verse which is the message from planet money's boss editor jonathan kerne
Jonathan kerne spends a lot of time juggling and fixing our scripts and making everything
Work and even though you don't hear him. He's a critical part of things here
But the other day somehow in his spare time he cranked out a villanelle, which is uh, it's a poem
Though banks are suffering a lack of liquidity and teeter on the edge of nationalization
Do not succumb to economic stupidity
Though congress is demanding more rapidity and tugs the strings behind the administration
Keep at bay financial rigidity
The credit markets all crave liquidity and wall streeters contemplate defenestration
Do not succumb to economic stupidity
While canesians say the budget reeks of tapidity and scorn what's left of privatization
Keep at bay financial rigidity
Zealots always demand philosophical solidity hasty action always trumps contemplation
Do not succumb to economic stupidity
Human nature involves some cupidity self-interest is the market salvation
Keep at bay financial rigidity
Do not succumb to economic stupidity
That's what I want on the planet money t-shirt if we ever get one
Do not succumb to economic stupidity right and big block letters
Yeah, yeah stick with planet money folks. Do not succumb
We'll be back monday with what I hope will be an amazing story about a sardine can really. Yeah
Okay, until then we're blogging like mad at npr.org

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

The first question comes from Russell Jelks (ph). A month or two ago, unemployment was predicted to peak at about 10%. Is this prediction still valid?

HOWARD ROSEN: I personally never went as far as 10%. I certainly suggest it within the 8 to 9% realm. You know, I'll tell you, all of this depends on what happens in the financial markets. The stimulus package is really trying to address the real economy, what's happening in terms of, you know, people consuming and things like that. But the big variable out there that we do not know is what's going to happen to credit if we're - you know, so far, we're containing this, and we're trying to, you know, to deal with it. But if this were to move into the, let's say, the personal credit - the credit card industry and things like that, that could have further implications on the economy. So to the extent that we contain this and deal with it and the banks start, you know, relending and things like that, the economy will turn around. And as soon as it does that, with a lag, the labor market will start turning around. And so I think it's fair to say that - I may be wrong, but I don't think the unemployment rate will reach as high as 10%. But again, I want to say the rate is only one indicator. And what we've been seeing is that you may not get as many people unemployed, but if you are unlucky to be unemployed, the cost of that unemployment is much greater.

CONAWAY: This is from Megan E. (ph). She writes, if you're offered a buyout package, and 3/31 is your last day, will your job be counted as a slashed job in April?

ROSEN: The unemployment numbers come from a survey that's done - it's actually done the second week of every month. So the answer to Megan's question is it will not - it will only show up in April. That's right. Even though she loses her job March 31 - but the thing is, when the survey comes in the second week in April and they ask, were you employed more than, you know, certain many of hours, 25 hours this week or something like that? That's what the question is. Unfortunately, she will answer no. And so she'll be counted as part of the April numbers. But, again...

CONAWAY: Now, we should say we don't know if Megan's actually losing her job. This is just - for all we know...

ROSEN: If unfortunate...

CONAWAY: Yeah, exactly.

ROSEN: Right. Exactly. But, again, I want to stress that these numbers are adjusted based on factors external to, you know, to the system - weather, if there's some kind of a holiday. You might have a holiday in a certain week which will affect - people taking vacation during the Easter period, as an example, because it comes in April. So those kinds of things will affect the - Christmastime is a big thing - you know, Christmas employment, people working temporarily.

CONAWAY: This is Andy Van Derkolk (ph). What about people who are not technically unemployed? I just graduated and am not eligible for unemployment benefits.

ROSEN: Right. Right. That's exactly right. And, again, I mean, I want to go to the end first, which is, the point is, does our system - does our safety - social safety net, does it deal with these new realities? Should we be providing assistance to workers who have not worked but are entering the labor market and looking for jobs? He's unemployed. So he's in as much need as someone who has been employed for 20 years and isn't working, but yet we don't provide him any assistance. And not only that, but we - I mean, they do have assistance in terms of employment search assistance and things like that. They can go and look, you know, what kinds of jobs are available. But it is very difficult. And I would also add to the Twitter that, unfortunately, he's coming into the labor market at a very bad time.

CONAWAY: Yeah. Tell him the news, right?

ROSEN: Exactly. So that's another question, which is, should he get some assistance? Because, unfortunately, you know, he went to college at a certain time, and he's coming out now. Should he get some assistance that someone who came out of college in the 1990s didn't need? So these are all kinds of question - and I'm not suggesting that we should be this kind of - you know, handing out welfare checks to everyone. I'm not suggesting that at all. We can tailor that assistance to meet the needs of those individuals. But let me just say that in other countries - again, I'm not suggesting it in the United States, but in other industrialized countries, they do provide limited assistance to people coming out of college until they find jobs. They do it.

CONAWAY: An example would be...

ROSEN: Germany, a lot of European countries. I mean, it's not out of the question there. Sweden, Denmark - it's not out of the question. They understand that that person is just as unemployed as someone who had been working previously.

CONAWAY: All right. Wonderland Cat - if I get an internship that pays a stipend, say, a thousand dollars a month, how will that affect my unemployment? Will I be eligible?

ROSEN: We count - well, first of all, in order to get unemployment, you have to have been working full-time.

CONAWAY: Internship doesn't count?

ROSEN: Now - the internship won't - right. Now, let me just qualify that because you've got some very sophisticated people writing in. In the stimulus bill, the federal government is now providing a pool of money, $7 billion, to the states to encourage them to cover part-time and temporary workers. Now, the states - it's voluntary. The states don't have to do it. But the government is - the federal government is trying to encourage states to do more of that. And it's possible - I mean, it depends on how these things are all structured. It's possible that her internship could be considered a part-time or temporary employment. And therefore, in a state that has done these changes, then she would be eligible for unemployment insurance. If she continues to receive outside income during her, quote, "unemployment," i.e., this internship, that money gets deducted from the amount of money she gets on a weekly basis.

CONAWAY: Let's do some - I'm sorry. You're still going.

ROSEN: No, I just - and I want to say one other thing because I just - because it's - I think it's really interesting, and I want to put it out here right now. We have heard from several governors that they are reluctant or do not want to take stimulus money. I want to - it should be made very clear, because I don't think it's been examined carefully, these governors are not suggesting that they're not going to take the billions of dollars for infrastructure spending or the money to help offset their budget deficits in their states. What they are saying is they're not going to take this $7 billion, and we're talking about a couple million per state, right?

So they're not going to take anything from this pool of money to provide unemployment insurance to their part-time and temporary workers because they fear that if they do that now, they will have to continue doing it, and, therefore, they will have to increase their payroll taxes in order to finance this in the future. So I want to make it very clear that these governors are not saying that they're not going to take, you know, the infrastructure money, the big cash - they're going to take that. What they're talking about is they're not going to take the government money to help unemployed workers.

CONAWAY: I have a couple of stimulus questions, actually.

ROSEN: Yeah. OK.

CONAWAY: One has to do with COBRA.

ROSEN: Yes.

CONAWAY: Sweet Sue writes, COBRA question - will the stimulus subsidize premiums for someone who resigned her job to move back home - to move back to her hometown because hours and pay was cut?

ROSEN: So what the Twitter did not tell us is if she's eligible for COBRA because she's asking two different questions. The first question is the stimulus package does provide a 65% subsidy if you are eligible for COBRA. Now let's define the terms. COBRA means that if you leave your job, if you lose your job, you can continue your health insurance for 16 - for 18 months, a year and a half - excuse me - 18 months at the same cost that it cost your previous employer, except that you will have to pay both sides, the employer part and the employee part.

But the important point is that you get it at a group rate, as opposed to if you lose your job, and you go try to find - I mean, health insurance, the rates are just, you know, gigantic. So you can continue at the same rate, the same cost, of your health insurance previously. But you have to pay both sides and only for 18 months. Under the stimulus bill, Congress has provided a 65% subsidy for that 18 months. She can get her COBRA if she changes jobs, and during that period, she doesn't have unemployment - doesn't have health insurance. And, in fact, if she takes another job that doesn't provide health insurance, she can continue the COBRA from the previous job.

CONAWAY: Nathan Proll (ph) wants to know, has there been any benefit to the self-employed worker thanks to the stimulus?

ROSEN: Unfortunately not. Let's see. In unemployment insurance, we don't provide any assistance to the self-employed. We should do it, but we don't. It would be a different system because, you know, you can't - you know, we don't know what the previous wage is, and you're not paying payroll taxes and all that kind of stuff. But we could come up with a scheme that could do that. We don't do that. On the health insurance - only if you are self-employed following full employment so that, let's say, you were employed. You had health insurance, and you left, and you started doing self-employed work for the next 18 months, and you were doing COBRA, then you would get assistance. But, again, it's spotty. If you didn't have health insurance, you don't get it. It's only for 18 months. That's a problem.

So I'm going through in my mind very quickly - I - off the top of my mind, I don't know. It does - well, the other would be the tax changes. That's where you would get - oh, I'm sorry. I should have said this at the outset, which is the - what I would call a payroll tax holiday. The - under the stimulus package, they are reducing the payroll tax for a finite period of time so people will have to pay - withhold less on a weekly basis. And that's going to help everyone. It's not specific to the self-employed, but it will also help the self-employed. And - but that's - on the other hand, you've been hearing that that is going to be rather small. It comes to, on average, something like 8 to $10 a week per person. People are starting to ask, well, how are you going to spend your $8?

CONAWAY: OK.

ROSEN: But, you know, over a half a year, that adds up.
