President Barack Obama has a plan for the American automobile industry, as Chrysler and GM seek more loans from the government. Chrysler plant worker Joe Grassi considers the news that Washington wants his company to partner up with Fiat. Yale Law School professor Jonathan Macey says the government was right to ask GM CEO Rick Wagoner to step down, even if the request was unprecedented. Macey has been calling for Wagoner's ouster for months. Plus: If Americans are saving too little and the Japanese are saving too much, how much would be just right? The market knows, says economist Kent Smetters of the Wharton school of business.
