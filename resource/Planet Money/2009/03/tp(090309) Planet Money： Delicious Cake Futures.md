When Joshua Bearman was a third grader, he got locked out of the lunchroom economy. His classmates piled their jazzed-up, sugarfied, food/not food snacks on the table and traded until the best junk won, while Joshua sat on the sidelines with the sardines and raisins his family sent. Then, one magical day, he dreamed up the delicious cake futures. Plus: The tax details of President Obama's plan to save the economy and the environment. And an laid-off intern architect fights off the blues.

Hear: Delicious Cake Futures

On today's Planet Money:

-- President Barack Obama has a plan for saving the economy and the environment at the same time. You just have to understand it first. Richard Harris takes us all to school.

-- When Joshua Bearman was a third grader, he got locked out of the lunchroom economy. His classmates piled their jazzed-up, sugarfied, food/not food snacks on the table and traded until the best junk won, while Joshua sat on the sidelines with the sardines and raisins his family sent. Then, one magical day, he dreamed up the delicious cake futures.

-- If you lost your job, and the people you called for help had just laid off 20 percent of their staffs, and a couple of hundred applications turned up nothing, what would you do? If you're intern architect Spencer Lepler, you dial back the job search, just a bit, and prep for that big licensing exam.

Bonus: A philosophical open question, after the jump.

Nick writes from KQED land:

    In thinking about our woeful times, I stepped back a little and started wondering ... while shelter has been a fundamental need for homo sapiens since the stone age, how can it possibly be that our economic and financial system got tied around housing to the exclusion of so many other human activities and needs?

    We are at a point where, in principal terms as many argue, housing is the single biggest factor wreaking all this havoc.

    Is this whole business of getting shelter, paying for it, making money off it (or not), remodeling it, expanding it, equipping and furnishing it, etc the most central and fundamental essense of all human activity so as to make our economic and financial systems exclusively linked with it?

    If there is indeed some rational explanation about the centrality of housing in human existence, and maybe some explanation for why we are having this crisis, how is it that other human needs such as food, breathable air, water, sleep, procreation, friendship/society, safety, curiosity for the cosmos or, say, a higher power, etc are NOT the factors that frame our drive for economic profit, prosperity, and growth?

    Anyone got an answer?

Aside: Which reminds me of something my hobo brother said years ago. My spouse told him it might be time to settle down, to stop being homeless. My brother replied, "I'm not homeless, I'm home free." Like that.

**(Laura Conaway):**

We've already set aside $22 billion to cover losses that we project will occur over the next 12 months.
After that, we have $19 billion left.
That said though, we'd like a bigger cushion.
We'd like to be prepared for all contingencies, so we are increasing our reserves.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Alex Bloomberg in New York.
And I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington D.C. It is Monday, March 9th.
That was FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Baer you heard at the top of the podcast speaking on the CBS Early Show.
The FDIC of course insures your savings and checking accounts at the bank.
And she says the FDIC does have plenty of money to continue to do that, but she'd be happy with a little bit more.
17 federally insured banks have failed this year, and it's been a busy couple of months for the FDIC.
I actually just, you know, they have this list of failed banks I just checked.
And if I counted right, in all of last year they had 25 failed banks.
So just in the first couple of months they have 17 now.
Right. Yeah, so we're on pace for a pretty busy year.
So coming up, we have a story of a financial scandal mixed with cake.
But first our economic indicator, and it is less than zero.
Okay, that's really a range, right?
Right. And it's also a book from the 80s.
It is also the World Bank's prediction for global GDP growth this year, actually shrinkage, I guess.
They didn't give a real number, but the World Bank is predicting that the global economy will actually shrink for the first time since World War II.
I feel like we could just record that phrase for the first time since World War II and just sort of play it in every single podcast we do.
Sometimes it's worse than that.
I know, exactly.
Alright, Alex, now I have a story about a stapler.
You don't have a story about a stapler, be honest.
Alright, it's not about a stapler. It does begin with a stapler, though.
I was basically, I was looking for a stapler, and I ended up at the cubicle of my colleague Richard Harris.
And among other things, he covers climate change.
And basically, Richard had his head in his hands, which is really unusual for him because Richard just never gets stuck on a story.
He's been known to write a one-minute story in under one minute.
But this was a story about the budget, and he was worried it was in danger.
He said, I'm really worried it's too down in the weeds.
And I said, down in the weeds? That's planet money.
That's what we do.
That's what we do.
So I grabbed it and we did a quick interview.
It's pretty interesting.
It begins with some good news, actually, or what sounds like good news, a planned tax cut for the middle class.
Supposedly very soon we will start seeing a little bit more money in our paychecks, as long as we're earning less than $250,000 a year.
And it's big. It's like the total amount of the tax break is like over $60 billion or something every year, right?
Yeah, it is a very big number.
So the question is, where do you get the money for the middle class tax cut, right?
Right. And what's the answer?
The answer is you get it from doing something good for the climate.
Is it another thing the Obama administration wants to do? It's all lining up very nicely for them?
It is indeed.
Although the details get to be a little bit more painful when you think about it.
But yeah, the idea of the climate provision is that basically the Obama administration is going to raise about $80 billion a year by auctioning off the right to put carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
It will no longer be just free to use the atmosphere as a sewer.
Basically, if you want to use it as a sewer, you've got to pay for it.
So basically that's where the money for the middle class tax cut would be coming from.
That's right.
OK, but there's a catch here, right?
There is a catch. Yeah, because if you're going to be charging people to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, you're going to raise the price of energy.
So everyone's energy prices are going to go up and we'll get some of that, but actually not even all of that back as a tax cut.
Right, and you had this nice piece of tape from Republican John Boehner of Ohio, I think, right?
That's correct, yeah.
Let's just be honest and call it a carbon tax that will increase taxes on all Americans who drive a car, who have a job, who turn on a light switch, pure and simple.
So what does the Obama administration say to that?
Well, it is not technically a tax.
It is indeed raising the price of energy, but it's not a tax.
And their argument is partly, well, we're returning most of that money to people, putting it back in their pockets in the form of a tax break.
So even though the price of energy goes up, people are more or less made whole, not entirely, but mostly made whole by the tax cut on the other side.
Yeah, it makes a lot more sense as a pitch like we're going to raise the price of energy because we need to do this.
That's going to hurt you financially, but we're going to give you a tax break to offset it.
If you approach it the way we did, saying, hey, you get a tax break, then it doesn't look so good.
Yeah, there's a little bit of a shell game going on here.
But on the other hand, I think it's a very, very hard sell to tell people that we're going to raise the price of energy.
But it's inevitable.
You can't really address climate change without doing something like that.
So has anybody done any calculations like how does it work out for someone in the middle class?
They're getting a tax break.
They're going to spend some more energy.
Is it hurting them more than it helps them or has it worked out?
Well, if you just sit around and do nothing, it'll actually cost you a little more than it will.
The increased price of energy will cost more than you'll get back in the tax cut.
However, the nice thing about the system is you actually can game it to your advantage and actually to the climate's advantage.
And let me give you a simple example.
Say you have a dirty old furnace in your house and you've been delaying fixing it.
All of a sudden, the price of fuel oil goes up a lot.
You think, well, geez, maybe I should get a new furnace, a more highly efficient furnace.
So you go out, you buy a new highly efficient furnace, and all of a sudden your energy prices go way down.
You've been incentivized by the increased price to go do that.
But your energy prices have gone down and you still get the same tax cut.
So you could actually come out ahead.
And that's one of the things that this tax system is trying to motivate, is trying to get people to think, OK, I can do the same thing.
My house is still as warm as ever it was.
But now I have a nice, clean, efficient furnace.
I'm saving money on energy and I've got my tax cut.
So the idea is to incentivize people to do things like that that make sense for them and make sense for the climate.
In theory, though, there is already an incentive to do that because I could save money right now by fixing my furnace, right?
That's true.
The problem is maybe it's not enough of an incentive to because the prices of energy are actually pretty low in some ways, not for people who are very poor.
And that's actually that's a really serious issue here because, yeah, you could go out, get a loan, get your furnace repaired, you know, get a buy yourself a brand new.
I need a loan so I can get a more efficient furnace.
You might. Yeah.
So I mean, a furnace is five thousand bucks or something like that.
It's not most.
Most people don't just have that money sitting around to say, OK, I'm going to go out and buy a new furnace.
So so there are ideas that when energy gets gets really expensive, people actually would start doing things that they wouldn't even though they could save money doing it now.
Right.
It turns up the heat, so to speak, on to make those sorts of changes.
That's NPR's Richard Harris.
Alex, I should add that he says right now the consensus seems to be that the climate change legislation isn't going anywhere, at least as is.
And it's not because it's too painful for consumers, but because it doesn't have enough in it for industry.
It stalled in Congress last time and it had a lot of stuff in it for industry.
Right. Right.
Well, let's do a change of pace here because we know that the economic news is grim.
The news is grim these days and and we've been reporting on that grim news over and over three times a week.
But we here at Planet Money aren't always out to depress you, our listeners.
And so we have a story today that will hopefully provide a little respite from our current troubles.
It's sort of a parable, though.
I don't know really what it's a parable about.
Maybe we'll figure it out after we hear it.
Right. We can set up.
Yes, exactly. What is this a parable?
What is this next story a parable of?
If you want to weigh in on that, that would be great.
So it reminds me of both the of two things.
One, the recent scandals involving Bernie Madoff and Stanford Financial Group, where, you know, people stole several billion dollars from people.
But it's also reminds me a little bit of the of just the financial crisis as a whole that sort of where the economy got into trouble by sort of creating these fancy financial derivative products that turned out to be sort of too good to be true.
It takes place in a third grade classroom.
The story does in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Joshua Bearman tells the story.
He was himself the third grader in question.
He was the third grader at the time in the early 1980s, which was a very important time for a third grader.
Well, this was like sort of around the time when the full weight of modern science and technology was being applied to lunch snacks.
You know, so fruit roll ups had just hit the scene.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Putting juice in a little something other than a can.
Exactly.
Exactly.
All right. So let me just set the scene here.
So Josh had just moved to this new school and it was a very fancy school where all the kids had these very snacks that he's describing these technologically juiced snacks.
They're chewy granola bars, rice, crispy treats.
But Josh himself came from sort of a different home.
His his home was very Spartan and his lunches were sort of hobo lunches by comparison.
In fact, he swore to me that his father one time sent him to school with a tin of sardines in his lunch bag and no way to open it.
Exactly.
But his standard lunch was a PB&J juice.
And for his treat, his father would give him a box of raisins.
Hey, raisins.
I sort of was obviously jealous of everybody's wonderful lunch snacks, but also like sort of to add insult to injury.
They would it was kind of all flaunted inadvertently in front of me because everybody in the beginning of lunch would they would start trading all of their wonderful lunch snacks with each other.
And they'd lay it out on this big table and sort of, you know, sort everything out.
And it was this incredible like a Roman feast of processed forbidden delights that I could watch from afar, you know, and and sort of me looking each thing that would come out of the lunch bag was more wonderful than the next.
And people were trading them.
They were like they were like what was the there was exchange going on.
Yeah, they would.
So everybody would lay it out.
Yeah, I want to get to this is an economics podcast and we're getting into the economy of butter butters.
And yeah, exactly.
Yeah, they would lay their they would lay their stuff out.
And the purpose of the table and laying everything out like the Roman feast was for the marketplace.
And everybody would start trading, you know, and and people would say, oh, well, listen, I've just had my fill of Rice Krispie treats for two weeks in a row straight.
You know, why don't I have some of your fruit roll ups?
And so they would trade it all around.
And it was actually is a pretty efficient system.
You know, everybody got what they wanted and it kind of all worked out for them.
You know, it didn't work out for me at all because I was totally outside of this economy altogether because my peanut butter sandwich had no currency value like in this market whatsoever.
What about what about your box of raisins?
Could you have gotten anything?
No, I don't think the raisins really went very far.
I mean, the raisins are a constant sort of source of frustration for me because I complained to my dad about the raisins.
And my dad would say, well, just, you know, show them that if you take the raisins out, you can blow through it.
And it's a whistle and it's 2400 Hertz.
He's a physicist.
And so and, you know, depending on how many raisins in are still in the box, it'll change the the the tone.
And like you can demonstrate vessel functions with like a cup of water as if this was going to amaze my classmates at the physical properties of the raisin whistle box.
Right. But getting to the language of economics, this was a non scarce good.
It had no tradeable value.
Yeah.
The raisins grow on the trees among an eight year old never has trouble getting a hand on a box of raisins.
There's no special.
Right.
Like dripping hands of adults.
Yeah.
Every turn.
Right.
What does not grow on trees is granola dips.
Yeah.
That needs to be that's in short supply.
Yeah.
In the lunchroom.
OK.
So you're you are in a scarcity position.
You are in a crisis.
There's abundance all around you, but you have nothing tradeable, nothing that can get you access to this abundance.
Right.
So I had to figure out something to do.
And I did.
I figured out a plan, which was I I lied, basically.
I told that I sort of came up with a false business prospectus, which was I told them that my mother is this incredible baker.
She's a baking expert.
And so and she always bakes this cake for everybody, all my classmates at the end of the year.
And the cake is so delicious and it's the best cake you'll ever have.
And can you just imagine now it's going to be the greatest cake ever?
And I sort of got them all excited about this.
This coming cake.
It's coming.
And so what I said was, listen, that's going to be a great day.
But in the meantime, I can offer you this special opportunity.
And what we can do is if, say, you give me those Cheetos now today, you can lay a claim on a stake, you know, well, on a share of this future coming cake.
You know, so you can have a deposit, you know, you can have a piece of this cake when it comes.
And so basically, I developed this sort of derivative lunchroom market for delicious cake futures.
Why do I guess that he ate his capital?
Right. Exactly.
Well, yeah, there's a couple of things I should mention.
First, there's there's voices that you hear in the tape.
One of one of them is, of course, Adam Davidson, Planet Money chief captain extraordinaire.
And then also starly kind.
You hear occasionally starly kind as a friend of Josh's and also a sometimes contributor to this American life.
And then there's two points that I want to make.
One, Josh's mother was a horrible baker.
There was no way she was actually going to bake a cake for the class.
And two, this happened a long time ago.
So Josh's memory is a little hazy and he concedes that he might be filling in gaps here and there.
But he swears overall that this episode is true.
And in his memory, this cake future thing, it caught on big.
Yeah, people would come and say, you know, it was like a trading floor.
It was a lunchroom.
The bell would ring and all of a sudden people would bring out their stuff and sort of want to see what it was worth.
I mean, to answer your question succinctly, I would just determine at that point what the deposit was going to be worth in future cake shares.
And so people would line up and they would and I would I would I would sort of to keep up appearances.
I was recording all these sort of transactions in my Trapper Keeper to make it look like there was there might be Bernie Madoff falsifying account statements.
We're falsifying.
So people would line up.
So all your classmates would line up with their like fruit roll ups in hand and then they would come to you and say what?
Yeah, they would come and say, well, I don't even know if like any words were necessary.
I would just like put it on the table and I'd say, oh, OK, fruit roll ups, half a slice watermelon fruit roll ups.
That's no slices.
That's disgusting.
I don't even want that.
You know, granola like a nut or butter dipped in chocolate and rolled around in industrial marshmallows.
That would be like a whole layer of a cake.
Right.
And and so people started.
Well, I mean, this is sort of spread like wildfire.
I mean, the first few people got into it and everybody else said, oh, we got to get in on this cake deal.
This is going to be great.
And so soon enough, like the ledger was was growing, you know, day by day.
And so I had sort of created this this speculative bubble.
The whole other economy disappeared.
Nobody was over there at the original table trying to trade.
They wanted they wanted to they wanted to take part in this glorious future.
So actually literally like literally like people stopped trading with each other and they were in it for the cake.
There might I mean, as I recall it, I controlled the lunchroom.
Not only did he control the lunchroom, Dave, he had all the 20th century snack foods his heart could desire.
And he would actually he said he's kind of a hoarder.
So he would like squirrel them away in his locker and at home.
And so he had all these like he had this ever growing pile of like nutter butters and Cheetos and stuff.
And also he was no longer an outsider in this third grade lunchroom economy.
So things were pretty good.
But there was only one problem.
So the cake was growing and the ledger was growing and nobody even questioned the ledger.
And they you know, that was that was it was people sort of set aside their whatever doubts they might have had.
And then at a certain point, I made the mistake, I think, in retrospect of allowing people if they had a good,
really good treat to customize the specific piece of cake that they had that they were trading their Cheetos or nutter butters for.
And I think what happened was sort of the market, the trading had been light and I sort of wanted to juice the market a little bit.
And I offered this new sort of add on, you know, like I could have a corner slice or a rose, you know, decorated rose.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
And so from there on out, then the then the Trapper Keeper ledger started describing a cake where sort of be like a piece of lemon meringue next to German chocolate and then half a layer of red velvet and angel food and and and chocolate mousse on top of it.
So, I mean, it was just this insane fantasy cake.
It sounded kind of an awful cake in a way.
I mean, having all those any one of those would be nice.
But it really is also like you were putting together specialty deals for people.
And like it was really like you had your custom OTC, you know, your bespoke derivative deal.
And then you had your straight ahead, you know, sort of like cake future.
And yeah, exactly.
I was offering. Listen, I was giving the people what they wanted.
They wanted they liked the idea of this cake.
And I think they like the very idea of it.
And also, at a certain point, when I started to maybe have doubts that, oh, yeah, this cake is a thousand feet tall.
That they just realized they were too far in, like they were into this cake for 40 bags of Cheetos and 20 Nutter Butters.
And so they couldn't just walk away from all their investments.
You know, they sort of figure, well, let's just keep putting, you know, Cheetos into this thing and see what happens.
Josh said that it's sort of the scheme went on actually longer than it probably should have because that dream,
even though it was sort of like this cake that was like, you know, 500 layers thick and, you know,
and like made up of like, you know, all these different things.
This the dream it promised was just hard for anybody to really let go of.
Even at a certain point, I believed in the cake, even though I know I had made it up, you know,
because I just imagined the hero's welcome I was going to receive when they wheeled this like technicolor baked colossus into the schoolyard.
And how incredible is going to be.
And so there was this mutually reinforcing psychology.
We all just bought into the idea of this cake.
And then what happened was eventually another guy in my class, this kid named Spencer,
he had been kind of the king of the original lunchroom economy because he always had three,
four pretty good snacks and his lunch so he could trade up and he could hoard.
And he always sort of had the best position on the table.
So so he had done quite well, you know, and now he's now he's left.
This flim flam man.
I'm the flim flam guy like the shyster hedge fund cake derivatives future guy.
And it's kind of glamorous to hang out over there.
And Mr. Fundamentals Spencer is over there saying like, hey, the numbers don't add up on this thing.
He's in the spot market.
He's like, I've been looking at this book.
There's no way this cake could exist.
Markopoulos.
Well, he was the first one that did a back of the envelope calculation and demonstrated that this cake would defy the laws of physics.
So so this is sort of where Josh's third grade financial confidence game takes on the exact contours of many of our current financial scandals.
Like, basically, there's this group that get taken in by this promise, this glorious promise.
And then there's the skeptic, this sort of voice who's saying like, this doesn't add up.
And then these two viewpoints are sort of at odds for a while and one tries to ignore the other.
But eventually the truth side sort of wins out.
So Spencer, you know, he doesn't relent.
He still is telling people.
And, you know, he does sort of have the numbers on his side.
And he was always good at math.
He's on the chess team. He's a rationalist.
Everybody, you know, respects Spencer.
And so they start listening.
And eventually, you know, just as sort of easily the confidence was built, it eroded and a threshold was crossed.
And, you know, you could kind of see it coming, but the market still continued.
And then there was one day to the next enough people didn't believe in the cake that, you know, nobody believed in the cake.
And the market just disappeared.
And people realized that this ledger was a sham.
And, you know, the Cheetos were never coming back.
They had lost all their Nutter Butter investments.
The cake wasn't going to appear.
And actually, Josh told me that told us that as in the current as in current financial scandals,
the authorities, who in this case were the school administration, looked the other way while the whole crisis was unfolding.
But once the truth came out, they felt compelled to act.
And their punishment was calling Josh's parents.
I got this whole lecture and which was sort of some combination of biblical parables about like the Tower of Babel or I don't remember exactly what it was.
And and and I sort of had a I had to learn a lesson.
I definitely remember that I remember getting and talking to about the cake.
And so I was chasing by my parents.
I don't remember with my fellow classmates really what happened.
I mean, I just went back to the same old I was on the outside.
I was blown a sad tune on my Raisin Whistle box, you know, banging my sardine can against a rock, trying to get my lunch, you know, trying to eat my lunch.
And it was just like back to normal, which is like the saddest little sort of image of him.
You know, he did avoid jail time.
He did avoid jail time. Right.
So that's true.
But my favorite things about that story is like sort of trying to imagine like if Josh were to actually go to his mother and be like, we need to make a case.
We need to make a case. Exactly.
It needs to be 600 layers.
Right. Yeah.
OK, Alex, now we actually have another story about a guy named Spencer.
Right. Spencer Lepler.
And he talked to our very own Laura Conaway.
Hey, Laura. Hey, thanks, guys.
This guy Spencer Lepler is he's looking for a job.
Actually, he's he's newly unemployed.
And he tweeted us the other day about losing his job.
Spencer is what's called an intern architect, which is kind of like a resident in a hospital.
It means that you don't have your license all the way yet, but you can do architecture.
And so he's been working actually for about four years.
Spencer got laid off just about two weeks ago.
Not much more.
And he says that most of the ads he's seeing for architecture jobs these days are only for people who have their licenses already.
Because every project has to have a licensed architect.
They're the ones you can't do without if your staff has to get smaller, the licensed people.
You still have to have a licensed person or else you can't go anywhere.
So Spencer says he's decided to use all of his free time that he has right now to prep for his licensing exam.
And in any case, it is a lot more fun than actually spending every minute looking for work.
The most depressing part of the whole situation has been when I call someone who I've gotten the contact through a work associate who says, you know,
or just someone that I've cold called and emailed, and they come back and say, you know, you've got a really impressive resume.
I'd love to hire you, but I've just laid off 20% of my staff and my friends who are in their 40s don't have jobs.
And that's, you know, you can hear the, you can just hear the distress in their voice.
And that's just the worst part.
What do you suppose that's about?
I think everyone's just fearful that they're going to be next.
But it doesn't, you know, if you that from my point of view, it looks like a lot of people are just living with the fear that they're the next person on the chopping block.
They could be the next one gone and then they'll be in my shoes.
You don't sort of as a matter of mood or feeling sound discouraged, but you've pulled back a touch from searching for work.
Yeah, I've pulled back a touch because if I don't, I will get discouraged.
So Laura, Spencer is sort of he illustrates a sort of a larger macroeconomic category a little bit, doesn't he?
Well, sort of. I mean, there is a category the Bureau of Labor Statistics famously keeps called discouraged workers.
And last month, February, there were about, they think, seven hundred and thirty one thousand of them.
And those are people who have really completely stopped looking for a job.
And Spencer is not there yet, but you could kind of see how you could start to get there after several hundred fruitless contacts.
Right. He was he was a discouraged worker.
He wasn't quite a discouraged worker in the term in the in the sense of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
That's right. No capital D there for him yet.
Right. Yeah. But heading there. Yeah.
And that's something that a lot of people do, actually, is when the economy turns bad, they go back and try to get extra training or go back to school.
