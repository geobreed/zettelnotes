AIG CEO Edward Liddy testified on Capitol Hill today. Congress wants Liddy to hold back $165 million in promised bonuses, but Liddy says he can't. The conflict is raising questions about who actually owns AIG. Meanwhile, the anger towards the insurance giant has been dominating the headlines this week, but not everyone is seeing red. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group says the government has much bigger fish to fry and that AIG outrage is a luxury we can't afford. Plus, who deserves more blame --Wall Street or Washington?

On today's Planet Money:

-- AIG CEO Edward Liddy testified on Capitol Hill today. Congress wants Liddy to hold back $165 million in promised bonuses, but Liddy says he can't. With the American taxpayers holding a nearly 80 percent stake in the company, some are asking — can't we just force him to do it? Chana Joffe-Walt gets a shareholder's perspective.

-- The anger towards AIG has been dominating the headlines this week, but not everyone is seeing red. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group says the government has much bigger fish to fry and that AIG outrage is a luxury we can't afford.

-- We've asked for your input on where to place the blame for the economic crisis. Jacob Ganz checks in on the debate over who deserves more — Wall Street or Washington.

**faster whisper:**
It was distasteful to have to make these payments, but we concluded that the risks to the company
and therefore the financial system and the economy were unacceptably high.
And if not paid, we ran the risk that we would have happened what everyone has worked so hard thus far not to have happened.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg. Today is Wednesday, March 18th, and that was AIG CEO Edward Liddy.
You heard at the top of the podcast testifying on Capitol Hill. AIG is, of course, a huge story.
And today we're going to really dig into it.
Yeah, we're going to talk about who exactly is running the company these days, who the actual owner is on behalf of the U.S. taxpayer.
It's an interesting twist in the story that we uncovered.
And we're going to hear from someone who says, listen, this is not as big a deal that, yes, what AIG did with all these bonuses is frustrating.
But, oh, boy, if you knew the bigger fish we had to fry, you would not be thinking so much about it.
And we're also going to continue our conversation about who we should blame for the economic crisis with a debate,
which our very own Jacob Gans went to, about whether Washington or Wall Street is more at fault.
And we'll hear more about that later.
Excellent. But first, the Planet Money indicator, Alex, today.
The indicator is 0.4 percent. And that is the amount the consumer price index rose in January.
Now, the consumer price index is the, well, that's inflation.
When we talk about inflation, basically some people in the U.S.
government go out and buy a bunch of stuff and figure out how much it costs.
I don't know if they actually buy it or just ask how much it costs.
I don't know either. But normally when you think of inflation, people generally sort of say, you know, boo, that's a bad thing.
But this number, I think people were like a little bit.
This was counted as a good news number, right?
Yeah. I mean, what we have been afraid of, and we talk about this probably too much on the podcast, maybe a deflation.
There's so much fear about deflation and just the quick version we've talked about a million times.
But normally you think, oh, prices go down. That's great.
I get to buy more. But deflation is very, very bad.
Creates a disincentive to invest, also a disincentive to sell.
Why invest or sell when everything will be cheaper six months down the line?
Just hold on to your money. Everyone holds on to their money.
The economy stagnates.
So paradoxically, unusually, we're in a weird time where most economists, most people are hoping for inflation.
Right.
And so we got a little bit of it.
We got a little bit of it.
So Ben Bernanke is probably thinking, woohoo, that was what I wanted.
All right. And now it's time to get back to today's big story, AIG.
So we've been hearing so much about these contracts.
The contracts to pay the bonuses to these executives in the very division that caused all the problem.
Right. We bailed out AIG to the tune of almost 200 billion.
As part of that, we have to pay these bonuses to the very division of the company that got into trouble and drove it into the ground and forced us to bail it out in the first place.
Gulling, absolutely.
And what people have been saying is that we have to do it because the company can't break the contracts, which guaranteed these bonuses.
The president says to Timothy Geithner, you do everything in your power to get that money back.
AIG says we can't give it back.
We're legally bound.
And all this raises the question, who is in charge of AIG?
The government got almost 80 percent of AIG's shareholder vote in exchange for that bailout money.
So we are technically an 80 percent owner, the U.S. government, the U.S. taxpayer.
So what is this back and forth about?
Yesterday on Capitol Hill, Congressman Barney Frank spoke to that question.
We own it.
But we apparently, I just double checked this, put some covenants in there sort of restraining our influence.
I think the time has come to act as the owner and then look at what some changes ought to be made as to what ones.
I think we have to look at it and see.
But I think you begin by asserting our rights of ownership.
And I do think asserting our rights of ownership strengthens the legal case.
I think we should be suing to get those bonuses back, not as the government that gave money to this private entity,
but as the owner saying, no, you got bonuses that you didn't deserve and we want them back on the merits.
And by the way, Alex and I were on Capitol Hill yesterday with David Kestenbaum.
And we were in the presence of Barney Frank.
We didn't actually get to talk to him, but he was around a lot.
We were in his hearing room.
Talked to his press person, right?
Yeah.
And many members of the committee.
We got lots of interviews, really interesting.
It was a fascinating bunch of interviews.
Lots of congresspeople.
Right.
And we'll be playing some of that stuff later in the week.
All right.
But let's get to the ownership thing of AIG because it gets kind of complicated.
So the government bought 79.5 percent of AIG, but they did not want to run the company.
They did not want to make AIG just another division of the U.S. government.
And so they called up some lawyers and said, how do you do this?
How does the government own a company but not run a company?
And what was invented was this weird trusteeship.
They put all that 79.5 percent of AIG into a trust, just sort of a legal fiction like a fake company.
And the trust is run by three trustees, three private citizens or well-respected citizens.
And they are the independent operators.
They get paid $100,000 a year.
And they sort of have legal responsibility for owning AIG.
They're not government employees, but they are owning AIG on behalf of the U.S. government, of the U.S. taxpayer.
Do you have the trust agreement, I think?
Yeah, I have it right here.
And here's one of the important passages here.
Pursuant to the terms of the trust agreement, the trustees will have absolute discretion and control over the AIG stock subject only to the terms of the trust agreement
and will exercise all rights, powers and privileges of a shareholder of AIG.
The trustees will not sit on the board of directors of AIG.
Day-to-day management of AIG will remain with the persons charged with such management.
So what does that mean?
Yeah, I mean, what I read here is the government, they don't want the Treasury Secretary or Fed officials or whatever
or the president calling up AIG all the time and saying, hey, my cousin needs a cheaper auto loan or auto insurance.
What can you do about my house insurance?
What can you do about my house insurance?
They want to avoid political influence.
Good luck with that.
I think we have successfully failed in avoiding political influence, for better or for worse.
So we really want to understand how this whole thing works.
What's the mechanisms by which the U.S. owns AIG?
We tried to get some of the trustees or their lawyers on the phone and they said it wouldn't be appropriate to talk,
so we couldn't get them on the record.
Our reporter, Hannah Jaffe-Walt, I think we can now say Planet Money's Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
Very exciting.
Very exciting. She's joined the team.
She reached out to someone who had an interesting perspective on all this.
His name is Richard Ferlato.
He's with, it's a kind of ridiculously long title,
the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Union, AFSCME,
Director of Corporate Governance and Pension Investments.
AFSCME is also a shareholder in AIG,
and they heard about this new thing the government was setting up as a shareholder.
We hope that they will hold the board accountable.
This means judging whether the CEO, Lydia, is actually doing a good job in his leadership position.
It means examining whether the compensation committee has actually approved compensation
that is appropriate and provides appropriate incentives for the management,
but also protects the pockets of the shareholders that are remaining.
They're very important strategic decisions.
Now, our concern is that the trustees will not hold the board accountable
and will not use the power that it has as trustees.
So we're just, we're asking for disclosure.
At this point, don't we own the company?
I mean, can't we just decide what will happen there?
We own 80% of the company.
Well, these trustees, if they decide to use it, have got tremendous power.
They've got the power to replace the board.
They've got the power to change executive compensation policies going forward,
and that potentially they've got the power to break contracts.
The government may not have that power directly,
but the government-installed trustees as owners of the company
certainly can have tremendous influence.
Is this nationalization? Do we now own AIG?
Well, the trustees have got an ownership position in AIG that's quite considerable.
Some people might call it nationalization,
but it's not the government that directly controls AIG.
It's that there is a, it's a trustee organization.
But the government created this trust and appointed these trustees.
Some people might call, could call that nationalization.
It's indirect control in that the government is not calling the shots at AIG,
but the government has got an ownership interest as any sovereign wealth fund
or large pension fund or big investment bank or investor.
You know, Warren Buffett has made sure that he has significant voting control
when he invests in the company, and this is nothing different.
It's the government as Warren Buffett, if you will.
So we actually do know who the trustees are.
This is publicly available information.
It might have been anonymous at first. I'm not sure, but it's certainly publicly available now.
They're all people with long-standing relationships with the Federal Reserve system.
So clearly, when the Federal Reserve set this up,
they picked people they knew and trusted to own AIG and run it for the American taxpayer.
It's Jill Considine.
She's a former chairman of the Depository Trust Company,
and she was a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Chester Feldberg, who used to work at the New York Fed
and was chairman of Barclays Americas for many years,
and Douglas Fossey, who's still a chief executive with the El Paso Corporation,
and he was a chairman of the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
So they are working for us, owning AIG.
And they have some of the strangest jobs in America right now.
I mean, honestly, I talked to a lawyer who said,
when you look at how do we do something like this?
How has the U.S. handled a situation like this in the past?
They quickly realized, oh, the U.S. has never handled a situation like this in the past.
We had to make it up in a weekend,
how the U.S. can own the world's largest insurance company
without having direct political influence.
Yeah, it's really complicated.
And I think I can safely say, Alex,
that this is one of the hardest moments I've had in this whole crisis
because it is such a tricky and nuanced story.
It makes me very nervous.
In fact, this next interview, I'm honestly feeling nervous right now.
I think people are just going to hate it, even though I think it's smart.
I think it's reasonable.
Right, but yeah, but it's also, it's just sort of literally,
it's like somebody telling you the thing that goes against every emotion you feel in your body right now.
So we talked to Ian Bremmer.
He's the president of the Eurasia Group.
And here are an article that's in the Washington Post.
We're linking to it at npr.org slash money.
And it's called AIG Outrage is a Luxury.
What?
Wait, you agreed with him.
I mean, basically, look, here's the thing.
I don't think anyone could disagree.
This is an outrage, right?
That's clear.
There's no way these people deserve this money.
This company wouldn't exist but for $180 billion in taxpayer money
and the fact that even several hundred million of that is going to bail out
the very people who caused the demise of the company and forced us to come in is outrageous.
They wouldn't be getting anything if it wasn't for the government.
And now they still want everything.
It's crazy.
It seems crazy.
We are not doing something so foolhardy as putting,
playing an interview with someone saying, yeah, they deserve the bonuses.
They should get bigger bonuses.
That's not what we're saying.
What we are saying or what Ian Bremmer is saying, let's put it on him.
What Ian Bremmer is saying is we are in a very serious crisis.
It might not feel as serious as it did last September and October,
but it's just as delicate.
It is a multi-trillion dollar crisis.
That means this crisis is 10,000 times bigger at least than the 165 million in bonuses.
This is a lousy situation.
It's a crazy situation.
But for the Secretary of the Treasury, for Congress, for many Fed officials,
for basically the apparatus of the U.S. government to lose all this time on this,
it's a bad idea.
And he's saying what we all need to do is like swallow our outrage
and forget about the bonuses, forget about all that.
I'm saying that if you're a subsistence worker,
you don't have the luxury of outrage.
You've got to make sure that your kids are fed and taken care of,
that you have a home above your head.
And right now the Obama administration is facing a global financial crisis
of unprecedented scale, and they're focusing on 165 million dollars with AIG.
They are basically spending a week of time, everyone's time,
in the rest while they have to get liquidity back in the system.
And they're saying how outraged they are at AIG.
They're jumping on the populist anger bandwagon because it is easy to do
and it's a serious mistake.
You know, one thing when I first started covering economics was just getting my heads
around different numbers because I think for most people,
a million, a billion, a trillion, what's the difference?
What is 165 million dollars in the context of this crisis?
It's a lot smaller than a lot of the earmarks that we've seen in the budget,
let's put it that way.
I mean, if you want to talk about sort of money and wastage going on
in the administration right now, you think about the tens of billions of dollars
that were sort of spent and magicked away in the first sort of stimulus package.
165 million dollars is a lot of money for you and I sitting around the table.
It's not going to move the needle in terms of where the U.S. economy is.
And furthermore, they're blaming the wrong people.
You know, where is the outrage at the SEC that was supposed to be
regulating what these organizations were doing?
Where is the outrage at the investment advisors that were making
recommendations to invest?
And furthermore, blaming the CEO of AIG who actually was brought in
after all of these decisions were made and is a part of the solution,
who you need to be supporting AIG's management today.
They cannot be in the crossfire.
All of these things, it seemed to me, are purely matters of convenience
because you want to be seen as being with the popular anger
and outrage that exists in the United States right now.
Now, can I fight with you for a second on what's happening?
Because I think, you know, my wife heard about this and she said,
I don't care if it collapses the global economy.
I don't want them to get their bonuses.
And I think that's, I mean, and she knows that.
She said, I know that I'm cutting my nose off to spite my face,
but it makes me so mad.
And my wife is a very reasonable person.
She's not a populist firebrand by any stretch of the imagination.
And I feel like this, I know it's a small amount of money,
I know it's a tiny thing, but the symbolism of it is so powerful
as to go beyond symbolism, I think, here.
And I think if Obama has to address it otherwise,
because the solution is political, right?
Like, he has to get money from the Congress
to do the work that he needs to do.
And if it's seen as I'm getting money from you guys
to give to rich people, you know, there's no way.
Why would anybody do that?
Well, I think there are two points here.
First of all, you know, I've never met your wife.
She's assuredly not a firebrand,
but she's also not president of the United States.
I personally find the fact that these guys are getting this cash outrageous.
I do. I don't want my president doing that.
Because as soon as President Obama does that,
he is open season on Congress expressing
how much more they're outraged about these folks at AIG
and the media spending days on this.
We do not have the luxury.
Congress has expressed more than sufficient outrage
on a whole bunch of little stuff
over the course of the last six months.
They certainly need a voice of reason above them
that's not going to devolve into that sort of politicking.
But the other point is that we need to recognize
what everyone already knows but isn't openly acknowledging it,
which is that AIG is actually legally obliged to pay these bonuses.
In fact, it's Congress that failed to limit bonus payouts
when it crafted the legislation to bail out AIG
and other financial institutions.
You know, we can't have the government act like it's going to actually undo
a valid and legally binding agreement because of popular resentment
that it itself crafted basically.
That's right. I mean, you'd be setting an incredibly dangerous precedent
and you're attaching a political risk premium to every contract
that we actually make going forward.
And I think the U.S. might want to think about that
when it criticizes foreign governments that engage in
wanton and willful nationalizations and misappropriations of property
because their people want it to.
Is that suddenly okay?
It's one thing for our stimulus to be seen as tit-for-tat protectionism.
It's another thing for our outrage at AIG to become tit-for-tat nationalizations
in absence of rule of law.
We do not want to walk down that path.
So just to quickly summarize,
because some of that might have been a little technical,
what I hear Ian Bremmer saying is
the potential cost of devoting several weeks
and possibly possibly a political overreaction to this bonus issue
is it'll make us all a little bit poorer for a long time.
I don't know if he's right.
But I think it's a compelling argument.
But at the same time, the outrage is real.
It's not going away.
I just don't think that's an option.
Right, right.
But he is correct in that the $165 million
is really a small drop in the bucket.
And that point was actually brought home to me when Geithner,
one of Geithner's solutions to the outrage was
he said, OK, well, we'll cut the $165 million
out of the $30 billion that we're about to give them.
Because no one would know this.
Right, exactly.
And then it was sort of like,
then it's just sort of like, wait, that's not what I want.
Even though that would get me the same exact logical result,
it did nothing for the outrage that I felt.
So now let's get back to the blame game.
And to help us is Jacob Gans.
Hey, Jacob.
Hi, I'm Alex. How are you doing?
Hey, how's it going, Jacob?
Good. Good to have you here, man.
Jacob is sitting in with the Planet Money team
while our much-loved and much-missed Laura Conaway
is taking a well-deserved break to go visit her family in Mississippi.
So Jacob, you are here because you went,
and I'm holding the program in my hand,
you went to the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate last night,
which had a bunch of people debating the question,
should we blame Wall Street
or should we blame Washington, D.C. for this crisis?
Yeah, actually it's a classic Oxford-style debate,
so where there's a resolution at the beginning of the debate,
and that resolution presented to this panel
was blame Washington more than Wall Street for the financial crisis.
So you have three people on one side saying I'm for that
and three people on the other side saying I'm against that.
Blame Wall Street more than Washington.
Blame Wall Street more than Washington.
So how was it? Was it interesting? Was it fun?
It was great.
The panelists are sort of a dream team of people
that you might pick to talk about something like this.
Do you want to tell us who they were real quick?
Yeah, actually many of these people have been on this podcast.
Actually, I've noticed all the people blaming Washington
have been on this podcast.
None of the people blaming Wall Street have been on this podcast,
not by design.
All right, Neil Ferguson, author of The Ascent of Money,
he's been here.
John Steele Gordon, an author of business histories
and, of course, the world famous Nouriel Roubini,
who saw it all coming, of RGE Monitor and NYU.
And they're all blaming Washington.
All three of them say Washington is more to blame.
Saying no, no, no, blame Wall Street is Alex Berenson,
a reporter with the Times.
I know him a little bit in Baghdad.
Jim Chanos, who is a famous investor.
He shorts stock, like he looks for companies that are doing badly.
He famously is the guy who sort of broke Enron,
who made us understand how bad Enron is.
And made himself a lot of money in the process.
A lot of money.
And also made a lot of money in this downturn as well, right?
Yeah.
And then Nell Minow, who is the editor and co-founder
of the Corporate Library.
She basically is a shareholder activist,
lobbying on behalf of shareholders.
Maybe the AIG trustees could give her a call
and learn how to be more effective shareholders.
Exactly.
So tell us how this, you get there, what's happening?
How does it start?
Basically, the chairman of Intelligence Squared,
Bob Rosencrantz comes out and sets the stage a little bit,
tells us this is what Wall Street did,
this is what Washington did,
but doesn't really try to push you in either direction.
And then you get the sort of classic Oxford-style speeches,
introductory speeches from all six panelists.
It's very structured.
I'm going to convince you of my point.
I'm going to make this assertion here.
This is what I'm going to do.
Please vote for my side.
Neil Ferguson got up first and said,
I'm in support of the resolution.
He listed each of the government agencies
that he felt were a part in loosening regulations
and gave us all their addresses in,
can you guess, Washington.
And then Neil Minow got up next and said,
she was against the resolution.
She pushed a little emotion into things.
What is the one thing we want from Wall Street?
We want just one thing.
We want them to be able to do math.
Right?
The math was wrong.
Their math was bad.
They put too much reliance on something called
the Gaussian copula formula.
Yes, the Gaussian copula formula
is at the heart of what created
the derivative securities, the credit default swaps.
They all relied on it.
They all got on one leaky little boat.
So you can hear the audience is encouraged
to get involved, to laugh, to applaud.
But things do get a little complicated.
It's not like lowest common denominator stuff.
It wasn't just populist outrage and anger.
Exactly.
At the Gaussian copula formula,
as most populist outrage is directed.
Nourio Roubini, for the resolution,
pointed the finger...
Meaning, for blaming Washington.
He pointed the finger at one specific guy in Washington.
The Fed and Greenspan, after the last
tech bubble went bust,
cut interest rates almost to zero,
and created this asset bubble,
kept interest rates too low for too long.
It was not at that time.
People talked about the Greenspan put
in the financial market.
Was it the expectation whenever trouble occurs
that Greenspan is going to ease things
for losses and problems?
It happened after the 1987 stock market crash
and the S&L crisis easing.
Then in the 90s where the tech bubble,
Greenspan warned about the
irrational exuberance and did nothing about it.
And after the tech bubble went bust,
it cut interest rates from six and a half
down to one percent,
and it created the latest bubble.
So it has been a crater of serial bubbles
one after the other.
And when people expect to be built out,
then they behave accordingly.
So the Greenspan put, we should define that.
Yeah, a put is a financial term
that's an option
where you...
You're guaranteed a certain amount of money
even if the thing you're buying
goes down in value.
So if I have a put on some stock for
$60, if the stock goes down to $30,
I can still...
You contract with me that I will buy it
at a certain price.
So it's basically a guarantee you make money
even if the thing goes down in value.
If you lose all your money, don't worry,
I'll bail you out.
Which isn't what he was actually saying,
but that was the perception.
Right, it's effectively the same thing.
They talk about the Greenspan put,
which had sort of the functional equivalent
of him saying that, which is not
certainly his intent, but that's basically
what people argue at this point.
They say that was the functional equivalent.
Right, and so we've got a lot of these
sort of technical phrases floating around in this.
But at a certain point, you can sort of
get yourself involved, and the panelists
start trying to win over the audience
using metaphors.
Just because the Keystone cops couldn't
catch the gang that couldn't shoot straight
doesn't absolve that gang
from its guilt.
In...
In not only
looting the system with material
intent, but materially
abrogating their fiduciary responsibility
to their clients and the nation.
That's Jim Chanos, the short seller.
And he said, everybody really
picked up on the Cops and Arbors thing
and ran with it. They referenced it later.
Audience members asked questions
about it. You know, and things
started getting kind of lively.
People interrupted each other. The politeness
everybody had at the start kind of broke down.
Which is really how these things are supposed to go.
Don't delude yourself. You can't simply
fix the problem of financial crises
by eliminating political finance.
Are you saying that there was no
lobbying involved in reducing the capital
requirements? There was humongous lobbying involved.
I couldn't agree more.
I'd like to see Alex Berenson who's been patient now.
I think
what we all would agree on
is that, in a very real way,
Wall Street has set the conditions
of its own regulation
in the last 15 years.
And clearly,
that has gone too far.
And Washington, I mean, to me,
seems to work best when there are two
strong sides
debating an issue. When it came to
deregulating the banks, there really wasn't anybody
saying, don't do it. I mean, there were a few people
who didn't have any money, but
the commercial banks wanted it, and the
investment banks went along with it, and
nobody really disagreed.
So, when you have a condition
where the industry is essentially creating its own
regulation, that's no regulation.
And then it falls even more
on the people, the executives, the
managers in that industry to act
like adults, which they did not
do. That was John Donovan in the middle. He's the moderator
stepping in to sort of settle things down a little bit.
And then Alex Berenson from the New York Times
making that point out, bankers not acting like
adults. It sounds like a lot of back
and forth over the same issues.
Jacob, at any point, did the panelists
agree
at least on the terms of a signing blame?
They really didn't, and that's
sort of like the tug of war
of the whole debate. At one point, an audience member
actually asked Neil Ferguson to
set some terms of appropriate behavior for banks
and for Congress. How do you decide
which are the reasonable
expectations from the different groups?
And won't that tilt
very strongly what blame you
assign? This isn't rocket science.
One set
of people under discussion
owes a duty to the public
interest. Those are the
politicians and regulators. That is
why we call them public servants.
And the other group let us take the investment
bankers, because, of course, Wall Street
is composed of many different institutions,
but let's take the investment bankers.
They owe a duty to their shareholders
and also to
bondholders. But the interests
of the public are to be defended by people
in Washington. That is the big
difference between these two groups, and that is
absolutely clear that we have
to lay the blame on Washington. The failure
of Bear Stearns was a disaster from
the point of view of people who invested in it, but it
became a disaster for the entire
U.S. economy, and indeed
the world economy, because of failures of regulation.
And those seem to me to lie
very squarely in Washington, D.C.
And, you know, Alex,
you and I were yesterday hanging
out at the Financial Services Committee
of the House, which is
where Congress sets the rules.
It is where Congress oversees the financial
markets. We talked to
about ten congresspeople
on that committee, and
I think every single one admitted
they don't understand.
It was both heartening and terrifying, because they're
working really, really hard to understand.
They wanted to understand. And they were
taking home materials and inviting in experts, and they're
really making it felt very honest,
but also they don't know
very much now, you know, and they haven't
known very much for the past, you
know, decade.
Yeah, so
I don't feel like
maybe we should take a side, but
I felt like I liked congresspeople
individually more, but
I maybe trusted
it as a body less.
Was there a sense at the end
of who won?
They settled the debate based on
which panel convinces more audience
members to change their mind, right? Right, exactly.
They voted at the beginning, and, you know,
it was relatively close, and then
at the end they vote again,
and whoever pulls more people over to their side
is who wins.
And it really eventually came down to just
essentially an emotional argument, as in
are you more mad at Wall Street banks for
being bullies who took advantage of their environment
at every turn, essentially stole money
from investors, or are you more mad
at Washington for being spineless, and
it felt like a toss-up to me. I mean, the audience
was responding to everybody. It's hard
not to get everybody involved.
So, given that
debate, it sounds really interesting.
How did things
turn out? Well, it was a New York crowd.
And now the results of the final vote.
60% of you are
for the motion, 31%
against, 9%
undecided. The side
for the motion wins.
Congratulations to them.
I'm John Donvan.
Thank you to Enhildred & Squared
U.S.
So they went for, they blamed Washington.
They did. You know, I do feel like
bankers are greedy.
That's what bankers are.
That's a fixed quantity. I don't know that they
got more greedy in 2003.
And it does.
And the more we've met bank
regulators and people like that, they
are, by their nature, sort of
rules-bound sticklers. And that's what
they should be. And it's
interesting, like, once you start meeting some of these people,
like, yeah, if there'd been more of them on the case,
sort of like, and they'd had a little bit more power, maybe,
things would've turned out different.
But can I give another argument? Sure. It's not
Washington's fault or New York's
fault. I mean, they both did plenty
wrong. Neither one stands proud.
But,
at the end of the day, there are macro-economic
conditions. This is the least
satisfying answer of all.
There are macro-economic conditions
that created
this situation. And we can't
and
it's really hard to figure out who's to blame.
Right. Bummer.
That's what you always say.
You never let me hang onto my populist
outrage. But you agree with me.
I do. My head does.
But not your heart.
And it is mine.
Alright. I think that does it for us here at Planet Money.
Thank you, Jacob. Thanks, guys.
Nice being here. Great to have you.

and to put your vote. Tell me how wrong
I am. Right now, we've got a great

I'm Adam Davidson. And I'm Alex
Bloomberg. Thanks for listening.
We'll see you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
