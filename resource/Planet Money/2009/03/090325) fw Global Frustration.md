Edward from New Zealand writes:

    I saw the post today claiming that NZ is not angry with the financial crisis. I don't believe that's true.

    For example, in this week's Listener (a weekly magazine targetted at middle-upper class - slightly lefty) there is this interview with a former adviser to the Prime Minister suggesting unemployment might hit 11%. Note that she's a former adviser because NZ changed its government, from left wing to right wing, in November. This is the same issue of the Listener with a cover tag of, "Ask yourself, 'Can I take a halving in house prices?'".

    Revenue for NZ's single largest exporter, the dairy company Fonterra, has dropped. This will have large impacts on the NZ economy because NZ's economy is very small.

    The NZ government, unlike most other western nations, is refusing to stimulate. In fact, quite the reverse. I can't find the quote but the Minister of Finance has told all the government departments that there'll be no new money forthcoming - ever - and they'd better get used to it.

    NZ did have a jobs summit with government, industry, unions, etc meeting to talk about new jobs. The outcome was proposals for a 9-day fortnight with the 10th day being for training funded by the taxpayer and a cycle lane running the length of the country to attract tourists. The 9-day fortnight will probably only end up applying a few firms because 1 day of training a fortnight is kind of impractical.

    The cycle lane might go ahead but the proposed cost, NZD 50 million, is widely regarded as too low and cyclists are complaining that they'd rather have cycle lanes, in the cities, for cycle commuters rather than a long one for tourists. It should also be noted that NZ is rather mountainous so a cycle tourist wanting to get through the middle of the North Island, say, had better be very well conditioned.

    NZ has a very small economy that is almost completely dependent on exports. The two biggest industries are dairy and tourism and the money generated from those industries is what the domestic economy runs off. How the crisis affects the rest of the world will definitely affect New Zealand.

**faster whisper:**
The rest of us can't afford to demonize every investor or entrepreneur who seeks to make
a profit.
That drive is what has always fueled our prosperity, and it is what will ultimately
get these banks lending and our economy moving once more.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington, D.C., and today we have another special guest host,
the newest addition to the Planet Money family, reporter Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
Welcome Hannah.
Thank you, David.
I decided I'd throw Caitlin in the broom closet too after her stunt Monday, but
we're going to let her out here in just a little bit because she actually has some
tape that we want to bring to you.
Today is Wednesday, March 25th.
On today's show, we are going to take a global anger tour and find out who people around
the world blame for the economic crisis.
We will take stops in China, Sweden, and as our globe guided us, we will also stop
in Egypt.
We'll also get a little more insight into the Treasury's plan to get toxic assets
off bank balance sheets from our own Adam Davidson.
But first, today's Planet Money indicator is 81 years.
That is how many years former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has been on this earth.
It is not his birthday, but I mention this because today President Obama put him in
charge of figuring out how to improve the tax code.
That means streamlining it, closing loopholes.
Volcker is one of those well-regarded elder statesmen, I actually just saw him
speak yesterday, and he's been around almost as long as the tax code itself,
which if you count the 16th Amendment as the start of it was 96 years ago.
Man, Paul Volcker, good luck to you.
So we've been getting a lot of questions about the toxic asset plan that was unveiled
this week, questions like, the big question really, is it a good plan?
Is it going to save the economy?
Is it going to hurt the taxpayer?
Is it going to give a bunch of money to people who are already rich?
Is it maybe going to do all those things?
So our colleague Adam Davidson has been thinking and reading a lot about this, and he joins
us now to talk about it.
Hey, Adam.
Hey, David.
Is this a good plan?
Is it going to save the economy?
Is it going to hurt the taxpayers?
Is it going to give a bunch of money to people who are already rich?
Is it maybe going to do all those things?
Right.
So I've spent the last two days reading.
I have a huge pile of reports and articles and papers I've been scouring.
It can be kind of overwhelming, reading lots of analysts' opinions, but I feel like there
are three main views, or I would actually say there are two main views and one view
that one guy had that I thought was interesting, so I thought I'd let you know.
All right.
So do the first two main views first?
Yeah, let's do the first two main views, because those are the key ones.
The first one I'm going to call the Vinny Catalano view, he's the head of Blue
Marble Research.
He laid it out in the most clear way.
He's been on this program a lot and has helped us understand how markets work.
And his view is basically that this is a good plan, that this is a very smart and
excellent plan.
And that view is that these toxic assets we keep hearing about are worth more than
people think they're worth.
This is also the view of Tim Geithner and Citibank and Bank of America, the
view that these assets are worth a lot more, but the people who might buy those
assets, hedge funds and private investors, don't have enough money.
They can't get the capital easily to buy these things.
So he's saying that the market is basically stuck, right?
The banks would be willing to part with these things at a price that people
would be willing to buy it, but the people who would buy it don't have the
financing, don't have the money, and so everything's just frozen.
Exactly.
And so the government is going to lend those people money at reasonable terms,
but those investors, the hedge funds and others, have enough, the phrase is skin
in the game, they're putting enough of their own money up that they really
have the right incentives.
They have the incentives to bid correctly.
They don't want to overbid for these assets.
They will bid correctly, but they'll bid higher than the current price.
And basically what this is going to do is get those investors to have enough
money that they could buy these assets at a decent price, get them off the
books of Bank of America and Citibank, and then Bank of America and
Citibank will be healthier because they won't be weighed down by these
mysterious toxic assets.
They'll be able to lend more money out to the rest of the economy.
The rest of us will go back to buying big screen TVs and investing in
new factories, and the economy will pick up, and that will actually make
those toxic assets worth more because it means more people have jobs, more
people are paying their mortgages, so there's less foreclosures, home
prices go up.
And in that scenario, no one actually gets too badly hurt, like maybe the
taxpayers buy it for a little too much or something, or maybe a little
too little.
Not really.
I mean, in his view, the taxpayer ends up making money.
The banks make money.
The investor makes money.
All around, he says, very smart, very good.
This is a plan that understands Wall Street.
OK.
Banks actually lost money from their initial investment, but they get the
stuff off their books at a price they're willing to part with it for.
Right, exactly.
So yes, I mean, banks don't go back to the inflated levels of the
bubble years, but they're better off than they are today.
So there's another view.
I call it the Paul Krugman view, just because he's the most famous
guy who has it, but lots and lots of other people have it.
His view is, no, no, no, no, no.
This plan should be called the Tim Geithner gives a lot of taxpayer
money to banks who don't deserve it plan.
And by the way, I'm not actually quoting Paul Krugman there.
I'm just paraphrasing.
So Krugman's view is that this creates unhealthy incentives.
It creates bad incentives.
That basically, a private investor, a hedge fund, is given enough money
at really generous terms by the US government that they have an
incentive to really play with the government's money.
Because remember, the investor is only putting up 3%.
I think just to be clear, we should point out that that's true
for the buying up packages of loans.
And it's slightly different.
We don't know the exact details for buying up
mortgage-backed securities.
Right, but it's some high leverage.
And so basically, the Krugman view is that the investors sort of
have an incentive to just take a flyer.
Hey, what the heck?
If I buy 10 of these, maybe five are not worth anything, and
five will be worth a lot.
I'll make a lot of money on the five that are worth a lot.
I'll lose money on the five that aren't worth anything.
But the taxpayer is going to take most of the hit for the
losses.
I get to pick up a lot of the gains.
In the end, I'm going to come out ahead.
And it creates a really bad incentive.
It creates an incentive for people to pay far more than
these things are worth.
All right, so Catalano and Krugman are really far apart
on this.
Yeah, they totally disagree.
Now, Vinny Catalano, he's a nice guy.
He, as it happens, does not have a Nobel Prize.
I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a PhD.
But he says explicitly, he says, hey, I respect Krugman a
lot.
I think he's a brilliant guy.
He's way out of his depths here.
He doesn't understand how Wall Street actually works.
He's an academic economist.
And Catalano says that the way the numbers work out,
maybe in an abstract economic model, there's the
incentive to overbid.
But the way people actually trade money, there's not
enough of an incentive.
There's not a big enough benefit that
people would overbid.
So he's confident that they will not overbid.
And for us, I do find that there are things that you
definitely are going to trust the academic Nobel Prize
winning economist on.
And then there's stuff that you kind of do want a guy
from Queens who's worked on Wall Street for decades.
I'm not saying I'm endorsing the Vinny
Catalano view, but I am sensitive to that take on it.
It's also possible, right, that the truth is somewhere
in between, that because the government is helping out so
generously the private investors who are buying this
stuff, that it will result in a slightly higher price
when they buy the toxic assets, a slight nudging
things in favor of the banks getting a higher price.
But maybe it won't be that much.
I mean, it could be somewhere in the middle,
right?
Exactly.
And I should note that there's so many predictions
of absolute disaster that we hear,
that if the US government does this or does that,
we're going to have a decade of recession,
like Japan, this lost decade,
or we're going to actually have a full on depression.
I am not seeing that about this plan.
The people who love this plan do not
say that magically, within a month,
everything's going to be great.
They say this is a step in the right direction,
not sufficient to fully solve everything.
The people who hate this plan do not say,
oh, this is a disaster.
It's going to ruin the economy.
They just say, it's expensive.
It means some rich bankers get more money
than they should, which doesn't make anyone happy.
But it doesn't destroy our economy.
So the stakes, while the stakes obviously
are very high overall, the stakes on this one
don't seem that high.
That there is wiggle room here.
They can get it sort of right and move things forward.
They can get it sort of wrong, but they don't move things
terribly far backwards.
But what about the third view?
You said there was a third view, right?
Yeah, I'm calling it the Norm Schieber view,
although I hear this from a lot of people,
and apologies to Schieber if I'm getting
some of his particular view wrong.
This, I should say, is a view for which there
is absolutely no data.
This is pure guesswork.
But it goes something like this,
that the Obama administration's in a tough spot.
Congress is sick of giving money to bail out banks.
Congress is not in a mood to nationalize banks either.
That's very unpopular politically,
which leaves them with minimal wiggle room.
So this plan, maybe, maybe, we don't know,
it's just a guess, creates a condition
where if it works, great.
But if it fails, the Obama administration
can say to Congress, hey, we tried our best,
we really came up with a comprehensive plan,
we're gonna need some more money,
we're gonna need the power to nationalize the banks,
and they get more wiggle room.
I will say there's another possibility,
which is this plan does not work as advertised,
and Congress loses even more faith
in Geithner and the Obama administration,
and we do not get a solution anytime soon.
That would be the nightmare scenario.
So let's, I guess, hope that one doesn't happen.
All right, thanks for ending on an up note there.
Hey, I like to depress the listeners.
Next time we'll get Geithner on the last,
although he can be pretty cynical sometimes.
All right.
All right, thanks, Adam.
Thank you, David.
All right, David, now it's time
to take our Global Anger Tour 2009.
Are you ready?
I am ready, yeah.
We are going to find out how people outside the US
are feeling about the global economic crisis,
and our first stop is China,
and Pierre's Louisa Lim sent us this from Shanghai.
Alarm and disbelief, those are the two words
that keep popping up when people here in China
talk about their reaction to the financial crisis.
One international relations professor
summed up the mood in academic circles.
You'd think people might be more angry
that the US has got us into this mess, he said,
but it's more like sheer disbelief
that a superpower would allow itself
to implode in this way.
But public anger is growing, and particularly
over the fate of the Chinese government's huge holdings
in US treasury debt.
Some see the financial crisis as a case of US hubris.
Recently, at a high-powered think tank seminar
on the Chinese economy, I sat next
to a young, well-educated businessman working in finance.
At one point, he said to me,
with no small satisfaction, up until recently,
American banks didn't trust Chinese banks at all.
Now, the situation is absolutely the opposite,
and Chinese banks don't trust American banks.
To find out more about who or what people are blaming,
I went to talk to Jiang Jun, a professor of economics
at Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University.
I think there is the only thing that we should blame
that is the post-Washington consensus.
You know, this is a joke, but I think,
the post-Washington consensus, you know.
Just explain to our listeners
what the post-Washington consensus is.
Post-Washington consensus is the idea
shared by most of the economists in Washington, DC
when they met the policy suggestion
to developing an emerging market economies
by saying that, well, we need a liberalization
of the trade, we should lower the barriers to entry,
we should do a lot of liberalization in the economy,
including financial liberalization.
So, I think the last 10 years,
that idea prevails in developing economies.
So, in the last 10 years,
we created so many surplus economies,
and the economy was a huge amount of the surplus.
And then the surplus measured by the dollars
would be recycled to deficit countries like the US.
I think that created a low pause, actually,
for the financial system.
So, I think this is the fundamental reason
of why we're gonna have the financial crisis today.
But if you follow this line of thinking,
then the biggest culprit responsible
for the financial crisis is China,
because China have the biggest savings,
the biggest foreign reserves.
Well, actually, if you look at what happened
to most of the emerging markets economies,
I think China is the only one of them.
We do have a lot more countries,
including some of the oil-selling countries.
They accumulated a huge amount of the dollars
at the foreign exchange reserve.
So, actually, this is the global saving glut.
This is not purely the case of China,
where you could see there's a lot more countries
in the last 10 years who turn out to be a surplus country,
simply because of the benefit allowed from the trade
with the US and with the European countries.
I've been reading that a new book is coming out
called China is Unhappy,
where a lot of nationalists are arguing
that China has somehow been brought down by the US
as part of a conspiracy.
I mean, do you think that the financial crisis
might actually help Chinese nationalists' cause?
I don't think so, actually.
Well, I don't believe so.
I think the global economy is moving very fast
to bring more emerging market within the global community.
Every emerging market has been benefiting
from this kind of integration.
But the question here is the financial system
cannot work very well with the globalisation process.
We need to find a way.
We need to actually change the rule of the game
to bring every country in the same equal standing point.
We need emerging markets to play more important role
in the maintenance of the global stability.
Zhang Jun was teaching an MBA class
when I went to speak to him.
So I also spent some time with his students,
a sample of bright, articulate Chinese
who pretty much represent what the business elite here is saying.
So here are the thoughts of Jimmy Liu and Kevin Lau
on who or what to blame.
OK, I guess that most people would like to say
that probably it's the United States
who created this financial crisis.
But I think that if we look at it as a whole,
I think that the global capital market,
the global economic regulation
and all these financial directive products,
they should be blamed for this financial crisis,
not only our government or our country.
Yeah, this is my point of view.
Yeah, I was quite agreeing with Jimmy
because I think such a big crisis,
they can't blame just one man.
It blames people greedy.
Maybe that's the most important thing.
So every people want more money.
Also, I would tell some eloquent thing
that once upon a time, I heard economics.
He said that it is the original thing of the capital
because people will also try to make much more money
as much as they can.
So I think that the capital,
it's still maybe the original cause of this financial crisis.
I mean, you're basically just saying it's human nature.
Yeah, that's right.
The human nature, greedy.
That's the original cause.
Greed.
They are so reasonable and nuanced.
I mean, in there, you hear we blame the United States.
We blame regulation.
We blame macroeconomic factors.
We blame capitalism, human nature.
It just doesn't make a very simple movie narrative.
Yeah, we want finger pointing.
Where's the bad guy dressed in black with the mask
and all that?
Right.
All right, what's the next stop on our tour of blame?
Sweden.
Why Sweden?
Because I love Swedish fish.
Because they've seen record drops in exports.
They slashed their key interest rate to 1%.
Unemployment is at 8%.
And because a reporter from Swedish public radio
stopped by our New York office,
and she's a really big fan of planet money.
And someone grabbed her for an interview?
Yeah, our producer, Caitlin Kenny.
She sat down with Linnea Erickson
from Sweden Public Radio.
Caitlin, come tell us about it.
Hey, guys.
I got out of the broom closet.
You sneaky girl.
Yeah, I'll put you back in there.
You only have a few minutes.
Yeah, so Linnea came by on Friday.
She said she's a big fan of the show.
And I asked her a little bit about what
she's seeing in the economy.
She lives in a region in Sweden, up in the north,
that relies really heavily on industry.
And so she's saying in a lot of the towns that she covers,
there's one or two companies that pretty much most
of the people work for.
So when one of these companies goes down,
there's just a mass of layoffs.
And it's not just the people from that company
who get laid off and suffer.
It's that then the other businesses in town,
the shops, the restaurants collapse as well,
because no one in the town has money
to spend on these other services.
And she told me that when she first
started working for Sweden Public Radio,
they used to cover layoffs of maybe like 50 people.
If that happened, it was a huge deal.
They'd go out.
They'd broadcast live.
But now they just can't cover it,
because pretty much every day they're
seeing layoffs of 500 people or more.
So it's just totally changed.
Wow.
So what's the answer to our big global anger tour 2009
question?
Who do they blame for that?
Well, there's kind of a few answers here.
One source of frustration that they've
been dealing with lately is the country's unions.
Sweden is a very unionized country.
People really believe in their unions
and depend on them strongly.
But Linnea told me that something happened recently
that kind of changed that.
Two or three weeks ago, one of the major unions,
which is the like metal workers union,
actually negotiated down their own members' salaries.
And maybe that doesn't sound shocking to you,
but that was a huge deal.
Yeah, it's a huge deal.
Why did that happen?
Because they are so worried about the future
for their industry.
And they're saying, unless we cut our own salaries,
we might see even more layoffs.
So for a union to negotiate down their own pay,
like that doesn't, that's not what the union does.
That's not what they do.
But no, they did.
And so they received some criticism for it.
But they say, hey, you know what?
We're trying to save thousands of you guys
from getting laid off.
So if you have to survive over 75% of your salary,
well, then be it.
So there you have an example of people really
trying to band together to figure out
how to get through this crisis.
They're all like, let's all take the cut
so that we don't have to lay off one person or another.
But then on the other side, there's
also cases of people who've just completely
turned against each other.
The big city, the 100,000, Gävle,
was going to fire 40 teachers, which it's not a huge 40 or 50,
something like that.
You're talking about 500.
Yeah, it was a big deal, because it
was firing teachers, which education is usually
the sphere where people are pretty safe.
But what happened was that the young teachers went out
and actually said, fire the old ones.
We need this.
We need the time to get into our work.
We're going to be the future.
So fire the old people that have worked here longer.
Yeah, and so of course, the union and the older workers
were like, what are you saying?
But people are turning against each other like that.
So what ended up happening there?
Well, they're still negotiating,
so we don't actually know who's going
to end up getting fired.
But that, to me personally, was just like, oh, wow.
What would it be like to be in an organization where
maybe you've worked there for 30 years,
you get a new colleague.
And the new colleague, together with his friends or people
his age, go out publicly and say, fire the old people.
How do you go back to having a good working relationship
with people after that?
So teachers against teachers.
Are people blaming the government as well?
Well, actually, she said, they're actually pretty happy
overall with the government.
They've had, similar to what we've seen here,
some bonus and insider trading scandals of their own.
But for the most part, there seems
to be a strong sense of governance support.
There was recently kind of a little bit
of political hot potato about what to do about Saab.
The parties in opposition wanted Saab
and also Volvo nationalized
because they support a huge number of towns,
ton of people work for these companies.
And they're basically like, with Detroit,
we have to save them, we have to do something.
But the government decided actually not to step in
and not to nationalize them.
So they definitely lost some votes
in some of those towns where these people live.
But overall, the country's response to it
was pretty positive.
People were happy that they kind of just decided
to let the industries figure it out on their own.
Caitlin, and they don't blame the United States?
They don't blame us at all?
Not really.
I mean, that was one of the things I asked her,
are people really upset or they like rioting?
She's like, you know, that's not really in our nature.
They are kind of upset at the US,
but they're more concerned about the policies
and the regulations.
Sweden is used to having a big government
and they think maybe the US government
just got a little too small in this case.
Another thing that I asked Linnea about
was how much they're following the news here.
How are they looking at things
and what are they thinking about?
And she said, they're definitely looking at the big picture,
but they're having some trouble
understanding how the crisis happened
because their ideas about credit
are so different than ours.
Here in America, you encourage people
to get into credit.
I actually had a fascinating conversations
with my parents-in-law when they visited me in Sweden.
And they said, aren't you gonna pay for this
with your credit card?
And I said, no, I don't have a credit card.
And they just looked at me and said,
you have to get a credit card.
And I said, why?
Well, you wanna buy a house, right?
They said, and you wanna have a car?
You need to build a line of credit.
And I told them, I said,
you know, it doesn't work like that here.
I said, we don't have credit scores.
We don't have, it doesn't matter.
When you go to the bank to get a loan for a house,
how do they decide how credit-worthy you are?
They look at your income.
What are you making?
What does your husband or your wife or your partner,
what do they make?
What big other loans do you have?
And then they decide whether or not you're credit-worthy.
Sounds like kind of a novel approach, doesn't it?
Yeah, that's a weird way of doing things.
Thanks, Caitlin.
Thanks, guys.
All right, and for our last stop
on our Global Anger Tour,
we decided to choose a country at random,
someplace maybe we don't hear about all the time,
but still living in this global crisis
with the rest of us.
And Hannah, you spun a globe,
and the lucky country was Egypt.
Yep, lucky Egypt.
And the first voice that I wanna play you here
was chosen very much in the same spirit,
and by that I mean randomly.
I mean, you got like a phone book,
Egyptian phone book or something?
No, I didn't have one of those around, David,
but I was getting up really early in the morning,
and I was dialing all these Egyptian economists
and experts, and I'm finding out
lots of interesting things,
like traffic through the Suez Canal is way down,
revenues from that fell by a quarter last month,
so that's a really big deal for Egypt.
And tourism is down.
So I'm talking to all these people,
and I'm trying to get through to this professor,
and I dial the wrong number,
and this guy answers, he speaks English,
immediately starts talking to me
and telling me all about himself
and asking me about myself,
and I tell him what I'm working on,
and he says, okay, interview me.
But who is he?
His name is Ahmad Diab,
and he's in Horghada,
it's a big tourist destination on the Red Sea,
and he works at a windsurfing club and hotel.
I'm the bartender in this club
because we have sometimes beach party and barbecue
and some stuff like this for our guests.
Are they mostly people from abroad
that come to your bar?
Yeah, of course,
but we don't go to American tourists.
Where are people from?
Most of our guests is German,
Austrian, Italian, English.
And when people come into your bar,
do they talk about the economy?
Sometimes, yes.
Everybody cry now from this everywhere.
When they go to drink something,
when they won't buy something,
or when they go to holiday,
they cry from this.
A lot of people now, they're fired from work,
and yeah, but this was okay for me
because I start my flat
and was everything very expensive to finish my flat,
and now the prices in Egypt are getting very cheap,
and for me, easy to finish my flat.
Have you noticed any change
in how many people come through?
Of course, this affects on our,
for example, something like the owner of my hotel.
Before, for example, he get every month
like 10,000 tourists,
but now he get like six, 7,000.
So he angry, so what he will do?
He's angry and he try to make the prices a little bit cheaper.
Right.
When people are angry about the bad economy,
who do they think started it?
Who are they angry at?
They think that, I don't know what I will say for you.
What I think start from United States, from you.
That's America's most strong economic in the world.
What we will do?
We can do nothing.
We couldn't help to make it better,
but our economic, it's not so strong like United States
or this big economic, big country,
so we don't see it so much like you.
Khanh, he sounded like he felt a little bad
telling you he blamed your country.
He actually, he apologized quite a bit for blaming us,
but the thing is that he didn't,
I mean, it wasn't completely that we blame
the United States and it's all your fault.
He's the sort of ambivalence about it.
I seriously, I could hear him shrugging through the phone
when I would ask him, who are people angry at?
He just sort of had the sense of,
we're a small country in this big game,
they're huge players like the US,
and what can we do?
Yeah, that's sort of almost sadder.
It's just like we don't have control over anything.
Right, right.
Well, I thought it was interesting.
I wanted to understand that feeling better,
so I called another expert.
I called a psychologist named Dr. Hani Henry.
He also teaches at the American University in Cairo,
and I asked him to put our bartender friend
and to put his country, Egypt,
on his psychologist's couch.
Tell us how are people feeling
about this big bad economy?
There is a wide range of responses.
Definitely there is anxiety, but in the part of,
I mean, let me just be frank to you.
In Egypt, I mean, there's a huge gap
between the haves and the have-nots.
I mean, if you're talking about someone
who has established a career or has established business,
yes, definitely there's a lot of anxiety,
there's a lot of fear.
But on the other hand, you get people
who are also despondent, who really don't care.
They feel that they've already had economic crisis for years.
They feel like they didn't get any part of the pie,
which by the pie, I mean like the open market economy.
And so they even make fun of it.
Like, yeah, it will impact us,
but in a funny way, it doesn't really mean
that it will impact them.
They've been just sarcastic or ironic,
but there are many, many state-owned factories
that have been sold to private investors,
and now these private investors are threatening
to lay off a lot of workers.
And now there's a lot of demonstrations about that,
especially in the area of texture
where the government used to control the industry.
So I don't necessarily see anger
like you're saying in Egypt.
I'm seeing more like frustration, confusion, anxiety.
I'm also seeing some sense of attack
against capital capitalism,
and the kind of like, let's get back to religion
kind of attitude, you know,
because let's get back to the time
where Egypt was socialist.
Okay, so right after this,
Dr. Henry starts telling me this story by way of example.
I thought it was really interesting.
So there's this guy, Nabil al-Bushi,
and he worked at a brokerage firm,
and he would bring in all these powerful people
in Egypt, officials and celebrities,
and he'd bring them on his clients,
and he'd promise them,
okay, you invest your money with me,
you'll get huge returns, 40, 50%.
Tell your friends.
And then in January, he's arrested in Dubai.
And all these allegations come out
that his operation was a fraud,
and that actually he was bringing on new people,
and he'd pay his old people their awesome returns
from the new people's money.
He's the Egyptian Bernie Madoff.
Right, that's what he is being called.
Dr. Henry used that name for him too.
And with al-Bushi,
there's actually a lot of confusion about what happened
and how he pulled off the scheme
and what it was and how much money was lost.
But yeah, clearly there's a similar to similar situation
in a lot of ways.
And so I asked Dr. Henry, an Egyptian Madoff,
are people egging his home
and demanding to see him suffer?
In a way, actually, I have to be honest with you.
If you look at the sentiment of most people,
because most people are the have-nots, right?
They actually felt very upset,
not at him, but those who invested with him.
So people were angry not at the Madoff-like guy,
but at the people who invested with him.
Because again, like I said, there's no,
I mean, the only very few have a lot of money.
And we don't care,
I mean, if there's unequal distribution of wealth,
but at the same time, people feel at some point
that the gap is just so huge.
So for example, you get this commentator who said,
you know what, I'm not worried about these people.
But I'm upset with them, I'm angry with them.
Instead of investing in a factory
that can employ hundreds of employees
and feed a lot of families,
they're going to this investor
so that they may collect 30% or 40% interest rate.
And this is the greed,
the accusing people of being greedy,
of being irresponsible to their fellow human beings,
to their fellow Egyptians.
I think that's, if you're talking about anger,
that's really the anger of the public.
Well, what do you make of that as a,
I mean, it sounds like you followed Madoff a little bit.
What do you make of the difference there?
Oh, I think, I'll tell you what's the difference.
You know, in Egypt, people feel that
because we don't have antitrust laws
and because there is a lot of corruption.
A, I mean, whether this is true or not,
people still have that strong conviction
that whoever makes a lot of money,
I don't want to say the word you're a thief,
but it's questionable how you made your money.
Many people do not trust the system.
They don't feel there is a system.
Whereas in America, I think things are a little bit
different because there are some rules,
there are some laws.
For example, you know, the Congress acted very swiftly
when there was this AIG bonuses thing,
and you know what I mean?
There's like more like a public outcry,
but people here feel like we're still
at the infancy level of capitalism.
The rules, they're still rules to be enacted.
And once you have these rules in place,
then people can trust the system.
Hannah, it's sort of like, you know,
they don't trust the system there.
And again, that's sort of the same thing
going on here people right now.
I think don't trust the system we have set up
really works the way they thought it did.
Right, right.
And we are looking to rewrite the rules
of our regulatory system here.
But it's interesting that difference.
Can you imagine a Madoff story breaks
and immediately columnists writing,
greedy Madoff investors get what was coming to them?
No, I can't see that.
That would help the newspapers
go out of business actually.
Well, there you have it folks,
a lot of different countries,
a lot of different emotions.
I think that does it for us here today.
