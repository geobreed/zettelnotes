The Fed says it's going to buy over $1 trillion in mortgage backed securities and long term Treasury bonds to help get the struggling economy moving again. Alex Blumberg and David Kestenbaum explain how it's expected to help. We keep hearing about all these toxic assets on bank balance sheets, but we've still got questions. How much is out there and how bad is it, really? Mike Thompson of Standard and Poor's gives us an inside look. Plus: a visit to Detroit.

On today's Planet Money:

-- Alex Blumberg and David Kestenbaum break down the Federal Reserve's plan to inject over $1 trillion into the economy by buying mortgage backed securities and long term Treasury bonds.

-- Industries usually take years or decades to make major changes. That's not the case in today's economic climate. NPR's Frank Langfitt tells us just how fast things are moving in Michigan's auto industry.

-- There are still a lot of questions about toxic assets. How many are there? What are they worth? Who has them? Mike Thompson, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, takes a stab at answering a few of ours. The good news? Some of what we thought was toxic, might not be so bad.

-- The Planet Money team visited Capitol Hill this week to find out how Congress is dealing with the current crisis. Alex Blumberg sat down with California Republican Congressman John Campbell, who made a surprising admission: he's confused.

Mike writes from Oakland, Calif.:

    My wife works for Wells Fargo. She got a bonus.

    We're not high level executives. We're a regular working family in the Bay Area. We both work and combined(!) our AGI will cross the government's threshold for the 90% tax. We're far from being flush with cash.

    In the last year, we've had our 401ks and investment accounts drop by about 30%, inclusive(!) of the contributions we made. We very recently had our home appraised for an aborted refinance. It showed our house lost about 30% of its value from the peak. So, all in all, the net worth of this working family is about two thirds of what it was in 2007.

    So, the lone bright spot recently was that she got a bonus from Wells for working hard all year in an area that was not responsible for any toxic assets.

    Now, based on the bill as passed by the House, it look like she's going to have to pay it back. We're expecting a second child in May, and we're trying to save money so we can buy a house in a better school district.

    Thanks, government. Penalize us. Good move.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) AIG, shame on you. AIG, shame on you. AIG, shame on you. AIG, shame on you. AIG, shame on you...

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

And I'm Alex Blumberg. Today is Friday, March 20. And that sound you heard at the top - that was sound recorded outside the AIG building on Wall Street. It was a protest. You might have been able to tell. And today, David, we have an interesting show. We look at, among other things, how many toxic assets there actually are in the world.

KESTENBAUM: And the claim that maybe some of them actually aren't really toxic. We're also going to hear a conversation you recorded from our recent trip to Capitol Hill. You talked to a congressman who admitted something that congressmen rarely admit. He said he doesn't know what should be done.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, it's a fascinating conversation, and that's in a minute. But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator - for a while now, we've been going with relatively small indicators - you know, 1, 2, 0, 14, something like that. I want to turn things around a little bit and go with a big indicator. In fact, I want to say the indicator is just over a trillion dollars.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, that is how much the Fed pledged this week to spend buying things that the Fed - up until this crisis, at least - hasn't really bought before. Specifically, the Fed agreed it would spend up to $750 billion buying the mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie and Ginnie Mae, and then another $300 billion buying long-term Treasury bonds.

BLUMBERG: Let's just talk for a second, David, about why they're doing this and how it's different. The Fed is such a confusing organization. I was trying to figure out how to talk about it here on the podcast. And it's not really something that you can simplify. But suffice it to say, normally the Fed just tries to influence this one interest rate. It's called the Fed funds rate. And when people talk about the interest rate, that's generally what they're talking about. And the Fed influences this rate by buying and selling short-term Treasurys. And you don't even necessarily need to know what those are, just sort of assume it's this one thing that the Fed usually buys and sells, and...

KESTENBAUM: Right. They have one dial. They turn it up. They turn it down. That's what they do.

BLUMBERG: Exactly. And usually this one dial, this one interest rate, is enough to stop bad things from happening in the economy. If the economy is overheating, you turn this one dial. You raise the rate. And that generally makes the banks a little less eager to lend out money, and that puts the brakes on an overheating economy. And if the economy is slowing down, they turn down the dial. They lower this rate, which increases bank lending and juices the economy a bit. So that's normally all they do, is they buy and sell this one thing called short-term Treasurys, and that causes all these other things to happen.

KESTENBAUM: Right. But what they're doing now is different because that old way, as - it's basically stopped working. You know, they've driven that one rate, the Fed funds rate, all the way down to zero. The rate that usually gets the job done now is zero, and you can't turn the dial any lower. And the economy is still tanking. Mortgage rates are still higher than they want, and it's still hard to get a loan. So the Fed is moving more aggressively, and they've started buying - among other things - long-term Treasury bonds.

BLUMBERG: Now, I know that doesn't sound revolutionary, but it's a very huge move. And I'm holding a piece of paper here in my hand that shows why they're doing it. It's a chart that shows the relationship between long-term Treasury rates and 30-year mortgage rates. And...

KESTENBAUM: That sounds like a fascinating chart you have there.

BLUMBERG: It's a fascinating chart because basically what it shows is that long-term Treasury and 30-year mortgage rates move almost exactly in lockstep. The lower the 10-year Treasury rate, the lower the 30-year mortgage rate. So the Fed, by buying so many of these Treasurys, hopes to drive the 30-year mortgage rate down. That's the way it works. The more people buy a certain bond, the lower the rate goes. And so the Fed hopes if it drives the Treasury rates down, that will drive down mortgage rates as well. It's a big risk. It's a huge move. The Fed almost never does this. The last time they did it was in the 1960s. And you got an email from our buddy, the economist Simon Johnson, who said about Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, quote, "this is Captain Bernanke going for the Hudson, the worst possible idea apart from all the others."

KESTENBAUM: Right. One of the concerns is inflation. You throw this money in the economy. At some point you're going to have to take it out, and that's always a little painful. One of the things I think that's so interesting about this time in general - you know, often, like, how the economy kind of edges one way or another, industries gradually shift over years. This is - that's just not what's happening now. Everything's happening, you know, really quickly. I was just emailing with Frank Langfitt from our business desk, who is in Michigan covering the car companies. And he was saying, you know, it's really just like a hurricane had hit. So I called him up to talk about it.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: NPR Dearborn Bureau.

KESTENBAUM: Hey, Frank, how are you? What hotel are you staying at?

LANGFITT: I'm in the Hampton Inn in Dearborn. Money is tight, so I'm staying at Hampton Inn.

KESTENBAUM: So I feel like, you know, when we were emailing...

LANGFITT: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: ...You were pointing out that, like - you know, sometimes the industry goes - industries go through kind of, you know, slow evolving changes. And then sometimes, like, everything happens at once. And this sort of feels like that. What is it look like out there? I mean, how fast do you see things changing?

LANGFITT: It - it's sort of happening faster than anybody imagined and faster than anybody can keep up with. I was with a woman who does a lot of financing for these suppliers that are just going out of business. And she's working seven days a week, living on PowerBars and is literally running from supplier to supplier, trying to keep the money flowing. And there's...

KESTENBAUM: These are auto parts suppliers. Yeah.

LANGFITT: Yeah. These auto suppliers who create, you know, most of the parts that actually go in the cars, but you've never heard of the companies. They're the ones who actually, you know, build the, you know, the things that go in the transmissions, the gears, the steering column, stuff like that.

KESTENBAUM: You know, I was reading - I mean, the unemployment rate there is something, like, 12%, right?

LANGFITT: It's over 11% - I think at 11.6.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

LANGFITT: So it's, like - it's actually - it's really interesting. When I first started coming here three years ago and the - you know, the Washington, where you and I live, it was very good economy. And I felt like I could have - sort of had a passport. Because I was going from one economy that was, you know, had some tech and, obviously, had all that government spending in Washington. And then you were going to Michigan, that was already in recession and had been in recession throughout the entire decade. And now it's like, you know, people say it feels more like a depression. And I think they're right. Because - just people are losing their jobs in droves.

KESTENBAUM: What do you see people doing who are losing their jobs?

LANGFITT: A lot of people, like, the UAW, are just looking - United Auto Workers - they're looking just - to just extend benefits to supplement their unemployment. Because there's - like, there's nothing out there, really, in the area to do. People would love to leave, but they're underwater on their houses. They're, like - they're literally, like, chained to their houses. They can't get away. And so they can't move down south or find something better. There's a guy at Chrysler, a spokesman that I was working with, and I actually had him on the air two weeks ago for a piece that I did. So I called before I came out this week, and he was already gone. And he got some job back in New Jersey.

KESTENBAUM: Like, you called and, like, his - the voice mail was - didn't exist anymore?

LANGFITT: No. I sent an email to him and so - and some other guy at Chrysler. And the guy wrote back and said, oh, this is Stewart's last day. And then I called. I said, well, you know, what happened to Stewart? And he said, he went home to New Jersey. He got a job with Jaguar and Land Rover.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

LANGFITT: And the guy that I was talking to sort of described this, like, you know, hey, lucky break for this guy. So, I mean, people are scrambling to get whatever they can. I - give you an example also - I was, like, walking through parts suppliers, and these are some - and some of them are, like, big companies. They have big buildings. And there were just a lot of empty desks, and there weren't many cars in the parking lot. And it was like a neutron bomb went off.

KESTENBAUM: Yesterday, while you were there, the government announced it was going to provide $5 billion in - well, they called it financing, which is sort of funny to me. Because you think of car companies giving you financing to buy a car, but they're getting financing here. How's it work? They get - it's for - they say the government is guaranteeing, if you're a part supplier and you make something for a big car company, and the big car company hasn't paid you for the stuff, you had delivered the goods, it was guaranteeing you?

LANGFITT: Yeah. The real problem right now for a lot of these companies is cash flow. They send - like, say I'm, you know, I'm trans - I'm the transmission - I make gears for transmission. I send my gears up to Ford. But Ford may not pay me for 45 days, right? Well, the orders are really low, anyway. I don't have a lot of money to keep my place operating, but I still have to run my machines. I still have to pay my staff. And I still have to pay the electric bill, and I'm just running out of cash. And so what this will allow to - what this will allow, like, me to do, if I'm a company, is the government will guarantee the payment on those parts that I sent to Ford or Chrysler - actually, really, Chrysler or GM is a better example. Because they're really in much worse shape - and I can use that guarantee and then go to a bank and say, listen, give me the money early. So you lend me this money, based on this thing that I'm going to get paid for. And you know that I'm good for it because the government's backing it even if Chrysler or GM go bankrupt.

KESTENBAUM: So that happened while you were out there. Then you when out and did - you went back to the parts suppliers. What was that like?

LANGFITT: Well, it's interesting because, you know, I expected them to be more relieved because they were really - people were really freaking out. But, you know, their problem is their - it takes time to set this program up. It's going to take three or four weeks. And people that I talked to said, well, OK, in three or four weeks, you know, I don't know, another dozen people will go bankrupt. That's how bad it is, that, literally, people are going day to day. There were a number of - this one woman, who I mentioned, who deals with financing to help these suppliers, she was saying that every week, like, five of her clients just go out of business. Like, they turn over the keys and they just walk away. It's, like, they can't - they've - not even winding down the companies. They just say, listen, I'm out of here. I mean, that's the speed at which things are happening, which you really don't normally see, even in a mild recession.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. And did they immediately understand the government's proposal? Or were you kind of...

LANGFITT: No, they didn't. We were - it was really interesting. I had actually been on a briefing call with the Treasury Department. And when I came into the office of the president of this company - it's called FormTech. They make kind of rough parts for transmissions - gears that you would, you know, probably in your car, in my car. They have them in a ton of cars here in the United States. And they were actually sitting there with the papers, kind of reading the briefing sheet from Treasury. And he was on the phone with people. He had been calling his congressmen to try to make sure that he can get in on this deal, this program. So, you know, it's one of these things. They had gotten some briefing from Treasury. But when this stuff comes down, people just start scrambling and they try to figure - you know, they try to position themselves. They try to understand how is this thing going to work? Am I going to get the money? Because GM and Chrysler are actually going to decide who gets this. So there will be - you know, not everybody's going to benefit. And this program is not designed to save the industry. It's designed to save the really strong and most important suppliers. And the other ones, they're going to die.

KESTENBAUM: In theory, the taxpayers, I guess, are on the hook for some of this if, you know, General Motors or someone goes bankrupt, right? - because then the government is stuck guaranteeing payments...

LANGFITT: True.

KESTENBAUM: ...That aren't coming, right?

LANGFITT: True.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. Hey, can I ask you just a reporter question?

LANGFITT: Sure.

KESTENBAUM: What kind of car do you drive when you're out there?

LANGFITT: I have to drive American. I am right now driving a Pontiac G6. I'm paying an extra couple bucks a day. And the reason is, when I got there, they offered me a Kia.

KESTENBAUM: Who makes it? Who makes the Kia?

LANGFITT: South Korea. So every time I come here, I've got to get an American car, because if I show up at UAW halls in something else, something foreign, people just get pissed off. And I'll give you an example. When I was here in January for the auto show, I come in - it's like 10, 10:30. It's snowing. And the guys there, like, they have almost nothing for me at Enterprise. And they say, listen; we'll give you a Prius. I'm like, if I go in there with a Prius, I'm going to get beat up.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

LANGFITT: So I'm padding around in the snow, like, looking around the lot for something, and I end up with a Dodge Grand Caravan.

KESTENBAUM: That's a huge car.

LANGFITT: Yeah, it, like, seats 300 or something.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

LANGFITT: I'm, like, one guy, and I'm like, I don't want a Grand Caravan. But what am I going to do? Politically, I just can't show up in a Prius because it's like asking for a fight. So I spent the entire week out barreling around Detroit in a Grand Caravan.

KESTENBAUM: All right, Frank, thanks very much.

LANGFITT: Sure, man.

BLUMBERG: All right. There you go, from the hurricane-strewn streets of Detroit, basically. Now, David, part of our mission here at PLANET MONEY is to answer your questions. And we get a lot of questions about toxic assets. Frankly, we ourselves have a lot of questions about toxic assets.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, like, here's my list - how many are there? Where are they? What are they worth? And when are they all going to go away?

BLUMBERG: And if I eat one, will it kill me?

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: You can try that.

BLUMBERG: OK. These are all critical issues because toxic assets are, of course, one of the things at the heart of this financial mess. The big banks have these so-called toxic assets on their books. Every quarter, they report huge losses on them.

KESTENBAUM: And if you're like me, you wonder how much - like, when is this going to stop? How much bad stuff is out there? And so someone directed me to this great table on the Standard & Poor's website, which I sent to you. Do you have it?

BLUMBERG: Yeah, I do. I do right here. And by the way, Standard & Poor's, that's one of the rating agencies that gave all this toxic stuff the thumbs-up during the housing boom - gave a lot of these toxic assets triple-A ratings, which - basically, it said they weren't toxic; it said they were totally safe.

KESTENBAUM: Right. But as you can see on the table, they've changed their mind.

BLUMBERG: Right. We're looking at a lot of charts here today on PLANET MONEY. Right (laughter).

KESTENBAUM: It's chart day. Yeah. But you could see a lot of these things that were triple-A are now - been severely downgraded, something like half of them, I think, overall, right? Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Right. It's really amazing. I mean, if you look at some of these things that, like - you know, triple-A was supposed to be as safe as a government bond. It was supposed to be the safest thing you could have. It was supposed to be basically cash. And I'm looking at this chart, the triple-A rated - so there's roughly 2,000 triple-A-rated CDOs. They were originally rated triple-A. And now almost exactly half of them have been downgraded. So they were off by half. They were 50% wrong.

KESTENBAUM: Right. So - but, you know, I'd say this chart made me feel a little better because, you know, in some of the documentation that went with it, basically, this is - originally worth $3 trillion worth of assets, which I thought, OK, that's - I can deal with that. Let me say it - $3 trillion. There, now I feel better. You know, it's finite. These are the toxic assets on these pages here. We can get through it, and we're done. I found this table comforting, except that that $3 trillion, it turns out that's not it. There's more.

MIKE THOMPSON: There could be a - globally, there's - I've heard the number 12 trillion. And in the U.S., it's certainly - the estimates range anywhere from 8 to 10 trillion.

KESTENBAUM: So that is Mike Thompson. He's a managing director at S&P. And I should point out he does not work on the rating agency, the rating side of things. His clients are the folks who own this stuff, and they want to know how much it's worth.

THOMPSON: We deal with money managers that, you know, have investors ranging from, you know, the retired dentist or widow who lives in Florida to, you know, an endowment for a small college to a pension for a union.

KESTENBAUM: OK. And how much money are they - how much money do these places control? I mean, are we talking many billions or...

THOMPSON: Oh, yeah. I mean - for example, I mean, it's not uncommon for us to look at a portfolio of structured in the tune of 50 to $75 billion.

BLUMBERG: And this is why it's so hard to do the work that we do because he just, like, drops in phrases like a portfolio of structured.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: And what he means is structured financial products, which what he means by that are mortgage-backed securities, basically - collateralized debt obligations. Anything with a complicated-sounding name that you would buy as an investment, that is a structured product. And they come with, like, 400-page documents just to describe the details.

KESTENBAUM: Right. I have one of them here. It's great bedtime reading.

BLUMBERG: Oh, you have some structured right there?

KESTENBAUM: I do. I got some structured, yeah. I talked to Thompson because he did this really interesting study, which suggests that some of the stuff that's labeled toxic and what we call toxic actually is not. So the study they did, they looked at mortgage-backed securities - this is the kind of vanilla-type stuff - where the mortgages involved were made to prime borrowers - so people with good credit ratings. And Thompson and a colleague ran some economic models. And they found that even if the economy gets really, really bad, if you own one of these toxic assets, he says you're probably going to get all your money back.

BLUMBERG: Yeah but come on. I mean, what have we learned about computer models and all those things? They're not - they weren't right before. Why should we trust them now?

KESTENBAUM: I know, I know. But what he say - listen, what he says makes some sense, right? I mean, you know how these things are set up, right? You get a pool of mortgages. And if you own a toxic asset, what you basically own is a spot in line to get paid from people when they pay off their mortgages in that pool. So if the pool is made of homeowners with good jobs and you're the first in line to get paid, he's saying, you know, it looks like you're going to get paid.

BLUMBERG: Right. OK. Well, that seems to make - that makes sense. So that means that these things should be basically trading at what they were originally sold for. That means that they should be - what is the market price of these things?

KESTENBAUM: He says it's, like, 50 cents on the dollar. So you take a 50% loss if you had to sell it right now.

THOMPSON: The market pricing is painting a portrait of the economy that's so dire, it - that it makes - it's even worse than the Great Depression, far worse.

KESTENBAUM: So you're saying if you take the price that these things are trading for right now and you use that to say, well, what does that mean the market thinks is going to happen to the housing market and to the global economy? - it says it's really, really going to hell. They're putting in an incredibly, incredibly pessimistic scenario.

THOMPSON: And it's to the point where it's ridiculous. I mean, it is - it's to the point where it's absolutely ridiculous. But, you know, that's a tough argument to make because the market is the market.

BLUMBERG: Right. And don't we all trust the market? I trust the market.

KESTENBAUM: I know you - I know, I know. I mean, it's a fair point, right? Right? There are people out there with a vested interest saying that's what I think it's worth, right? But his argument is that this - one of the reasons this stuff really isn't trading is that the people who are parting with it for 50 cents on the dollar, those are the people whose backs are really up against the wall.

THOMPSON: Personally, if I had, like, you know, a billion dollars of my own capital, I'd go on a buying spree and buy every prime senior tranche that I could get. But, you know, they're not as easy to come by as you think. The big money managers don't want to do something incredibly, galactically stupid. They do not want to sell good assets.

I've actually had a chief risk officer say, help me convince my board not to make an absolute disaster. By selling these things, we're going to take a huge write-off when, if we just hold them to maturity, we'll be fine. And the funny thing is, their maturity is about two to three years out. So they have two to three years out, and their problem goes away and they're made whole. And their hardest time they're having internally is just communicating and educating the people that - you know, ultimately, at the board level to make sure they're comfortable with this approach.

BLUMBERG: OK. But these are toxic assets that maybe aren't so toxic. They're a small part of that maybe $12 trillion of the stuff that Thompson said was out there, right?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. I mean, these could be maybe a couple trillion or something, but...

BLUMBERG: The good ones?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, the good ones, yeah.

BLUMBERG: So if his clients have the good stuff, where did he say - where's all the crap?

KESTENBAUM: That is a great question. And he doesn't...

BLUMBERG: Oh, man.

KESTENBAUM: ...Where is it, right? You know, 'cause he says every time he goes to these people, they all say, our stuff's great, you know? And part of it is that people who have junk aren't going to come to him and pay him money to tell them that it's worth zero, right?

BLUMBERG: They already know that, basically.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, they already know that. He says it's pretty clear, you know, that the big banks have a lot of the bad stuff on their books, which is why the big banks keep having to declare multibillion dollar losses. So I asked Mike Thompson if he could tell, you know, from their write-downs, how bad was this stuff that the banks owned?

THOMPSON: Yeah, I can tell you that if they're writing it down, it's bad. But I can't tell you that - is that the full amount that the write-down should be? I mean, look, we've been - from the last three quarters - and this is a rough - you know, this is rough because there's a little bit of, you know, maneuvering they do. They redefine us from level two to level three, and there's some funky stuff that goes in there. But the point is is that it's going down about, you know, 50-plus billion a quarter. They don't give you the transparency to - all at once...

KESTENBAUM: I see.

THOMPSON: ...Say, here's what I own. And I wonder, if they did and we did find out - if the investor community did find out that what, you know, all these guys own were, like, the mezzanine equity tranches, what - you know, that's when you get nervous.

BLUMBERG: Because as we've pointed out, some people might judge the banks to be insolvent. If the banks basically came clear and said, we own all this stuff and here's all the toxic stuff, then they would be judged insolvent.

KESTENBAUM: Right. And when he says mezzanine and equity tranches, he means the bad stuff there. I should tell you, though, that our conversation managed to end up on a - on what might be a good note.

THOMPSON: I guess, let me - not, you know, be a complete, you know, dark day person here. Let me point one other thing out of this. You know, this is a scenario that a lot of investors sort of are starting to subscribe to, which is, you know, when you saw the banks say, well, our underlying businesses were profitable. And they're - they can manage to take write-downs every quarter. If they can continue to do this for several quarters, you know, what - you really think happens here is that when this - this is kind of going to run its course. In two to three years, this - all this stuff goes away. The key thing is not to have the banks take a torpedo before.

BLUMBERG: So two or three years - here's one thing that doesn't make sense to me, Dave. Aren't mortgages - mortgages are like 30 years long, right? So why's he saying, two to three years, it'll all be done?

KESTENBAUM: Right. So that confused me too. But it turns out that these pools of mortgages, they actually kind of - you know, people in - people have the mortgages, they prepay or they refinance or they default. So the pools actually evaporate faster than 30 years. So you tend to know where you stand. And he says, you know, in a few years we'll know where everybody stands.

BLUMBERG: So basically his advice is just sort of like, close your eyes and just like, hold on for another three years (laughter).

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, don't get too...

BLUMBERG: It'll all be OK.

KESTENBAUM: He says - it's not his advice, but he says, you know, that may be what the government's doing. You know, if we just kind of hold on and maybe don't look too closely at things, everything will be OK.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, it seems like a long time to wait. But, you know, I mean, the point is that there aren't really that many good solutions. So maybe trying to wait it out is the best thing. And, you know, we - you know, this brings us to sort of our next thing on the agenda. We - you and I, Dave, and Adam Davidson, our colleague, were up on Capitol Hill the other day talking to a very scared group of people.

KESTENBAUM: You mean lawmakers.

BLUMBERG: Right. Because they are in charge of figuring out how to keep this financial disaster from happening again. And specifically, we were speaking with congresspeople on the House Financial Services Committee. That's the committee chaired by Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank. And that committee, everyone says, is, if not the key player, at least one of the key players in charge of rewriting the rules of our financial system. You know, everyone says this will be the biggest regulatory overhaul since the Great Depression. And we talked to a lot of the people who are going to be rewriting this legislation, who are going to be making these new rules. And when you talk to them, the tone is a little different than normal.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, I didn't hear a lot of partisan bickering. I mean, there was some of the sort of party line. But I would say a lot of people we talked to were genuinely concerned about the magnitude of the task ahead of them.

BLUMBERG: Right - and confused. And that led to a lot of them saying things that you almost never hear congressmen and women saying. For example, listen to this conversation that we're going to play for you I had with Congressman John Campbell, who's a Republican from California. He started our conversation with a fairly stunning admission. And it's an admission that I heard from a lot of the members of the committee that I talked to. But it's an admission you almost never hear from elected officials.

JOHN CAMPBELL: I can tell you that, for one, I'm not sure, even in my own mind - I mean, you know, if I were king, I'm not sure what I would do at this point. And I don't think I'm alone in that viewpoint. This stuff is not easy. There are a number of different alternatives, a number of different thoughts on how to do it.

BLUMBERG: Has this crisis that we're going through now, has it challenged any of your previously held beliefs about sort of the role of regulation, what should be done? Is that something that you're going through now?

CAMPBELL: It has. You know, I'm a generally Republican, small government, less regulation type of person. But it is clear to me that in this case that what happened here was a lot of people going around the system creating a shadow banking system behind the regular banking system. And it clearly broke down. So, yes, it's caused me to question that. And I can tell you much to the surprise, I think, of some of my colleagues here is that I'm favoring some - again, I'm not sure exactly what form it should take, but some very tough regulation. I mean, this thing is ugly.

Back last September, October, we came within a hair's breadth of runs on every bank and the entire financial system collapsing. That frankly scared the - I'm not sure what words I can say on NPR, but you know what I mean. It scared the hell out of me. And I do not want to go through that again. I do not want to see anybody go through that again. And so I'm certainly willing to take much more aggressive steps than if you had asked me this a year and a half ago than I told you I would have done.

BLUMBERG: Right. It's interesting about this crisis is that the way - because there must be - there's a part of me and I think everybody who wants to just sort of say, like, you know, AIG, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, they made bad bets. They're in the marketplace. You live by the sword, die by the sword. And it just has this, you know, this logic. And yet we - for very good reasons are, you know - can't let that happen. But, you know, you must wrestle with that all the time, right?

CAMPBELL: Oh, yeah. I mean, there's no question about it. I mean, AIG made some dumb decisions. In a normal thing, they fail. They fail, the stockholders lose their money. Everybody loses their job. Nobody gets their bonuses. Same thing with Lehman and the rest of these. But because of this interconnectivity part, which is the first part of the regulation that we're looking at, because if AIG goes down, probably many other banks, not just in the United States, but worldwide, big ones, big people go down as well, which then starts to bring down some others. And that's what this too big or too interconnected to fail.

And I think what we want to - get to and it's one of the questions I asked in the hearing today - is, well, we don't want anything that's too big to fail, because then by definition, we can't let it fail, which means that the people running that company will make decisions knowing that they can't fail. And if you know you can't fail, you'll make a lot of bad decisions. And there has to be - you have to allow failure. And one of the debates - in fact, I listen to it somewhat going on today is, well, all right, if it's too big to fail, can it be regulated enough that it won't fail? Maybe. I'm not sure.

BLUMBERG: So it seems like those are the - so you got two sort of options here, which is, one, sort of, you know, sort of heavy regulation that will break companies up before they get too systemically important, which is probably, you know, is, like - has - is - put it - you have to do delicately. It's going to put an onus burden on lots of businesses. You're going to have to have, like, regulators with a lot of power. Or allow them to get too big to fail, but then just sort of regulate the crap out of them, basically. And it's sort of - those are two - I mean, that's - is that sort of what's on the table now, you think? Is that - do I have that right?

CAMPBELL: Yeah, I think you do. Now, there was a third option that was presented in the committee today, which was an interesting one that I heard, which was, well, that you pile on regulatory requirements as an entity gets bigger and more interconnected. And those regulatory requirements will be very costly. Let's take a capital requirement. You know, you require a bank to have a certain amount of money in reserve to cover what they have loaned out and if it's 10%. As you get bigger, it goes to 12, then it goes to 15, then it goes to 20. Well, at some point, the cost of doing that - because that's money you can't lend. That's money you have to just have - it may become too costly to get that big.

BLUMBERG: The - sort of the type of sort of attempting to understand and attempting to learning and the sort of the comments that you're hearing from your colleagues, are you - is - how unusual is this set of hearings versus other hearings that you've been a part of, other debates that you've been a part of in Congress?

CAMPBELL: Well, I think it's very unusual because of the complexity of the situation because there aren't kind of two camps. I mean, most bills, most issues have two camps. You know, I'm for this or I'm against this, or I'm for this, or I'm option A or option B. And oftentimes, those are largely down party lines. In this case, I'm not quite sure there's that there are two camps. And, you know, you hear some Democrats questioning things that would indicate perhaps they're to the right, if you will, where I am on the issue. And you'll hear me and others like me, maybe, say something which would appear that I'm to the left in traditional parlance of some of the Democrats.

And so I think it's so big, so complex and so difficult that you just don't have the two-camp-type thing at this point, although there are those that are definitely in the don't regulate and regulate-everything-as-much-as-we-can-type thing. I don't think either one of those are going to prevail, though.

BLUMBERG: Is the fact that there is this sort of confusion about the issue - there's not, like, these two camps sort of settled into - does it actually - for you, does it actually free you up in a weird way?

CAMPBELL: Tremendously so. I'm really engaged in this because I know I can engage, and this is not a situation where the majority Democrats are going to do what they want to do. And our goal is and our objective is just to complain about it, present an alternative and let the public decide later. But they're going to do what they're going to do, and that's what's going to happen. I feel like that's not the case here for a couple of reasons. The issue is so big and so important. I don't think - and this would be true if Republicans were in charge, too. I don't think the majority party wants to do this all on their own because it's just too significant a change. And the public probably won't go for that. So that enables those of us in the minority to participate.

But also the other reason is because there's isn't, like, this big ideological line, there isn't these clearly drawn camps, and to me, it's an intellectual exercise, too, which I find very fascinating. And it's a problem-solving exercise, which I also - I've always liked to do. I've - before I lost my mind and went into politics, I was in business, and I was essentially a startup and turnaround guy. I went into businesses that were in trouble and tried to figure out how to turn them around. And so we now have an economy in trouble, and this is a little bit - same sort of thing on a much bigger scale.

KESTENBAUM: Hey, so that's great. We are going to be checking back in with Congressman Campbell and other members of Congress as they try and rewrite the rules of our financial system.

BLUMBERG: Yes, and see how they sort of proceed in figuring out what to do and where they eventually come down.

KESTENBAUM: Hey, I think that does it for our podcast today. Keep sending us your photos and your economic indicators. We've posted some of them on our blog - npr.org/money. I'm also going to throw up all those charts about the toxic assets that we were talking about today. That's it. I'm David Kestenbaum.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thank you very much for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I'M CONFUSED")

HANDSOME FURS: (Singing) I hope this life don't get you down, this dirty old time in this dirty old town. And if you're feeling instructive, there's something to do. Sometimes we get confused. I'm confused. I'm confused. I'm confused.
