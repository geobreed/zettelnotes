Some weeks, Planet Money listeners have hopped all over us for using too many free-market economists. Now, David Kestenbaum sets one free-market thinker against an ideological opposite, a Keynesian. These two forces have had only one proper fight — the Great Depression. Both claimed victory. It's Russell Roberts, who wants to keep government out of the economy, versus Steven Fazzari, who thinks it's time for a stimulus package. Who's right? Your future could depend on it.

Today on Planet Money:

Planet Money listeners have sometimes hopped all over us for using too many free-market economists. Now, David Kestenbaum sets one free-market thinker against an ideological opposite. These two forces have had only one proper fight — the Great Depression. Both claimed victory.

Now, in one corner, it's Russell Roberts, an economist at George Mason University, who believes the economy works best when government stays out of it. He likes the Austrian School of economic thought.

In the other corner, it's Steven Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis. He believes the government plays a key role in the economy, especially when it comes to recovering from recessions. He describes himself as a Keynesian.

Which of these mighty warriors is right? Your future could depend on it.
