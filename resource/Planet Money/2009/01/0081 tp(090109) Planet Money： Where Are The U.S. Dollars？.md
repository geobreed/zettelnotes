If you add up all the U.S. currency out there, it's about $900 billion. But where is it? Economists Ken Rogoff and Richard Porter say a lot of it is overseas, and much of the missing currency helps people avoid paying taxes. The good news: It helps the economy. Plus: Money trader Will Aston-Reese gives the (improving, but still not great) view from his desk. And a laid-off worker wonders if she can get even a low-wage job.

They can say whatever they want to say, but if they block swift action on an economic
recovery plan, I believe they're either uninformed about the dire straits that we're in in this
nation or they're uncaring.
Hi, you're listening to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm David Kestinbaum in Washington, D.C.
And I'm Laura Conway in New York City.
It's Friday, January 9th.
It's about 2.40 p.m.
And that was Senator Barbara Boxer you just heard.
Later on in the podcast, we're going to give you the answer to a puzzle that we posted
on our blog.
And the question is, where are all the U.S. dollars?
Because it turns out most of them are sort of missing.
Like the ones that are not in my wallet.
And we're going to get to the Planet Money indicator in just a minute.
But first, we want to ask for your help.
Our colleague Adam Davidson emailed us this morning about the 2008 Weblog Awards.
These are where people get to vote for the best podcast of the year.
And we don't really care about awards.
Our mothers do, but we don't particularly.
But there was something about this email from Adam that really made us all snap
to attention.
Which is that we are losing to the Harry podcast muggle cast.
And I'm sure that the Harry podcast muggle cast is an excellent podcast and we wish
them well.
But we want them to come in second place.
So if you don't mind, please go and vote.
You don't have to register anything.
Just go click.
And actually, I'm going to do it on this computer because I think you can do it
once per computer per 24 hour period.
Not that we looked it up or anything like that.
We're going to post a link on the blog or you can just Google Weblog Awards.
We have a big economic Planet Money indicator today.
Yes, it's a really big one.
The Labor Department released its official unemployment numbers today.
We've been talking about these numbers.
They've been coming all week.
People have been waiting for this day.
Here are the numbers.
In the month of December, another 524,000 people lost their jobs.
The Labor Department also adjusted downward.
Its numbers from back in October and November made both of them worse.
In November, we lost about 50,000 more jobs than previously thought.
So of course, the unemployment rate is going up.
It was 6.8 percent.
It's now 7.2 percent, the highest it has been since January 1993.
And you know, that's a pretty big jump for a single month.
That's a really big jump.
You have to look hard to find a silver lining in that.
There is a little bit of good news.
Yesterday on the podcast, we told you that Bloomberg was reporting that short-term
lending markets, what's called the commercial paper market.
We talk about that a lot on this podcast.
It's basically where banks or big companies go if they need to borrow a lot of money
on a short-term basis just to kind of keep the cash flow going.
Things were looking a little better there.
They're back to pre-September 15th levels, which was where they were basically before
Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, before the whole massive credit crisis we've been
reporting on really got started.
So we figured it was a good time to check in with our favorite interbank lending desk,
Tradition Asial Securities.
So our colleague Adam called up Will Aston-Rees, a trader there, to find out what's going on.
So Will, I guess the credit crisis is over.
Everything's back to normal.
Oh yeah.
Go out, get your mortgages.
Everybody, banks are lending money for free.
Just line up at the trough.
Am I sensing some sarcasm?
You're picking up on that, are you?
So what's going on?
Bloomberg said that commercial paper lending is back to September 10th levels.
Listeners to Planet Money know that September 15th is when Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.
The next day, the money market funds just poured out of commercial paper, out of short-term
lending and you, as we know, because we talk to you a lot, saw basically absolutely
no business.
There was money.
There was no money moving between banks.
What's it like now?
Well, the last time we spoke, I told you that we started to see people starting
to line up a little bit more in Dibble and Dab, and that trend is continuing.
We are seeing more buying.
We're seeing more size going on.
We're not seeing a lot of curve risk being taken, meaning we're not seeing people
buy out much beyond six months.
But in the two and three month area, where you can still get yields over 1%,
we're actually seeing some pretty good flows of money into that area, and well.
And Will, I just want to, just a quick, because Planet Money, we always try and explain the
terminology.
Basically, when a bank has money to lend or some money market fund or something
has money to lend to another bank, they are worried about that other bank going
belly up.
And so, the longer they lend it to the other bank, you know, three months or
six months or nine months, the longer it is, the more time that bank has to
go belly up.
Banks that are worried, that are nervous, lend overnight or for a week or for a
month, rather than for three months or six months or nine months.
Right.
Exactly right.
You know, I think I call it curve risk.
It's more of time risk.
You know, obviously, the longer you're invested with someone who might be of
shaky credit quality, the more risk you're taking on that something is
going to happen to that investment.
Right.
If you say, let me borrow 20 bucks until tomorrow, I might be a little more
trusting than if you say, let me borrow 20 bucks for three months.
Right.
Well, I would never lend you 20 bucks, as you know.
And you'd be wise to do that.
Right.
So, when you say a lot of flows, you mean a lot of money.
Yes.
When you say a lot of money, you mean a lot of money.
I mean, billions of dollars is a typical day for you.
Are we back to pre-September, pre-crisis levels?
Well, in terms of CD investing, no.
We are seeing some people putting a decent amount of money down in terms,
you know, 500.
I think we actually did a billion of one name in three months today.
It's more, the money flows are a little bit more temperate.
So, while we may be seeing a certain number of trades, we're not
seeing a certain number of volume.
Meaning, we're seeing 15 to 20 trades a day where we were seeing two to three
before.
However, we're not seeing billion dollar trades.
We're seeing 100s and 200s.
100 million, 200 million.
Yes, with the occasional 500.
And I know, for most of us, you hear $100 million.
It sounds like a lot of money.
But at an interbank lending trading desk like yours, that's really, well,
it's chump change.
Right.
So basically, if short term lending isn't happening, the economy is
effectively dead.
But short term lending starting again doesn't mean the economy is ready to
jump up and dance.
Right.
But it is a start, though.
Right.
Right.
It's a start.
OK.
So with some, I mean, I guess from the generally incredibly depressing
news you usually give us, this is a slightly upbeat.
You know, and it's like I'm such a happy-go-lucky guy, too.
Isn't that strange?
It is true.
All right.
Will Aston Rees, Interbank Lending Trader for Tradition
Asia Securities.
Thanks so much, man.
Oh, you're welcome, Adam.
It was good talking to you, as always.
David, you also promised listeners an answer to that puzzler.
Right.
So we posted this on the blog.
And the question is, where is all the US currency?
Right.
If you open up your wallet, not always mine, but if you open yours,
there probably is some cash there.
But if we add up all the money in everyone's wallets.
It's way, way, way, way less than the total amount of dollars
we know are out there.
So I talked to Richard Porter about this.
He's an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
There's something like $900 billion of currency in circulation.
Yeah, it's more in the hands of the public.
It's more like $800, so.
OK.
$800 billion.
And the population of the United States is $300 million, right?
Yep.
So that's like between $2,000 and $3,000 per person,
including every baby.
Yep.
Which doesn't make sense.
Right.
No, and it hasn't made sense for quite a while.
And I've written on this subject, spent a lot of time
thinking about this subject.
Another guy who has thought about this is Ken Rogoff.
He's an economist at Harvard.
The first thing to know is, of that $800 billion,
more than 60% of it's in $100 bills.
And when you opened your wallet, did you have any $100 bills?
I'd guess not, because I don't give them at the ATM machines.
Whose do you see people at the supermarket using $100 bills?
No.
I mean, occasionally, but basically no.
So where is all the money?
And the authorities have been wondering that for a long time.
Right, so where is all the cash?
Let's take a few seconds, and we can all think about it.
OK, pencil's down.
So one answer you might have, one of the things I thought of,
was cash registers.
So what about cash registers?
OK, survey says, is it cash registers?
The short answer is cash registers
have only a very small percentage of it.
They account for a couple percent of the total.
It's not big at all.
Another possibility you might wonder about, banks.
They have ATM machines.
They have those huge vaults.
So what about banks?
So indeed, banks are holding some cash,
and it adds a little bit.
But they're not storing gigantic amounts in the bank.
I mean, if you think about it,
there's a bank in my neighborhood
that, for some reason, gets robbed periodically,
and they did again.
And the person made off with $2,000.
I mean, OK, that's great, $2,000,
but the whole bank was holding $2,000.
So clearly, it's not in the banks.
So where is all the money?
Well, Richard Porter has an answer
for where a chunk of it is.
It's outside the US.
So what is it doing outside the US?
Well, it's basically mostly used as a store of value.
Like, farmers in Argentina just decided
they'd rather be paid in dollars
than in the local currency.
And so people ended up stashing a lot of dollars,
and both in Argentina and Russia.
The last time I made an estimate
was just ages ago for Argentina,
but they had something on the order close,
approaching $50 billion of US dollars.
Mostly in mattresses or safety deposit boxes,
or somewhere like that,
which they just used to protect their savings.
But according to Porter's work and the work of others,
this does not explain everything.
So maybe half of the US dollars are overseas.
We have a little in our pockets,
a little in bank saves.
That still leaves hundreds of billions of dollars
unaccounted for.
So either there is a lot more overseas than we think,
or it's actually here in the United States under our noses.
Ken Rogoff thinks that's the case.
He thinks a lot of it is in what's called
the underground economy.
That may make you think of drug dealers
with suitcases full of cash,
but he says much more common
is probably people using it for transactions
so they do not have to pay taxes.
Rogoff says this explanation makes sense
because if you look at other countries,
they also have a lot of unaccounted for currency.
And it's not like the Japanese yen
gets much use outside of the country.
So it's got to be inside their country.
He thinks it's being used by people often avoiding taxes.
At weddings, you just,
you don't give the couple a check.
You give them an envelope stuffed with 10,000 yen notes.
It's just much more common to use cash.
In Europe, they use cash a lot.
Germany had a thousand mark bill,
and now the euro, they have 500 euro notes.
The euro is worth more than a dollar.
That's something like a $700 note.
And people will go in and buy a car with euro notes.
And then not pay taxes on it, is that the idea?
And it has to link to not paying taxes at the end.
So you find countries all over the world
where they have basically the same structure as the US.
There's a lot of cash per person,
but bizarrely it's being held in these giant notes
and they can't account for it.
So Ken Rogoff and Richard Porter
disagree about this part a bit.
And it's understandably a sensitive topic
with the government because if a significant chunk
of all US currency is being used in illegal activity,
well, shouldn't somebody be doing something about that?
Maybe we should get rid of those
large denomination dollar bills.
I gather from my friends inside the treasury
that Bob Rubin, the treasury secretary,
held a meeting about whether we should have a $500 bill,
but it was talked out of it.
If Rogoff is right, and a lot of the US bills
are in the underground economy,
he says there are reasons you might actually
not want that to change too suddenly.
Because if all the drug dealers and tax evaders
stopped using the dollar and switched to the euro
or something, that would actually be a blow
to the US economy.
And the reason is sort of complicated,
but basically the US government loves it
when people use our currency.
The Fed actually profits when people use US cash.
The mechanism is something called seniorage
and it's sort of complicated to get into here.
So we'll post something about it on our blog,
along with a link to some of the research
trying to figure out where all the missing cash is.
Hey David, do you remember that person
who called into the economist house call that time
and she had literally been laid off the night before?
Yeah, she called actually for a consultation
with Simon Johnson and then before we could get to her,
she lost her job and when we called
she said she just lost her job.
Yeah, her name is Sophia Suhoo.
She was working as an intern architect
in Portland, Oregon.
I checked in with Sophia again today.
The new unemployment numbers had come out of course
and I really wanted to see how 7.2% looked to her.
Is she finding any work at all?
Not like she did in the last recession.
It's funny, after 9-11 it was difficult to find a job
and at that time because I was only
a couple of years in my career,
it was still easy for me to get a job
not in my career.
So in 2002 I was working in retail part time
and working at a truck accessory company
doing marketing part time.
What kind of accessory, truck?
Truck accessories, which is kind of ironic
because I don't know how to drive.
You mean like mud flaps and stuff?
They were selling like cargo pullouts.
Okay.
It's just kind of like a weird.
But at that time people were willing to take a chance
on me because I wasn't so deep in my career
and so now 10 years into it when I apply for jobs
and I have been applying for jobs not in my field
like marketing, admin, management type of stuff,
I'm getting zero responses or a response the next day
saying your resume is impressive
but it's not gonna work out.
So at this point it's making me very nervous
because I am no longer even being considered
even being considered for some of the lower wage jobs.
David, I have to say that would make me nervous too
if I couldn't find even the low wage jobs.
The last time unemployment was this high
I personally scraped through by tending bar
and tipping around and this one job I had
I worked in a basement sticking barcodes on magnetic tapes
for a big railroad in California.
Really?
Yeah, it paid the rent.
Okay.
Well right now I'm making living working on this podcast.
I think we just finished another one.
Do not Planet Money listeners forget to vote for us
in the 2008 Weblog Awards.
Don't let the hairy podcast muggle cast make Adam cry.
Don't let them win.
No, the links on our blog npr.org slash money.
I'm Laura Conaway and I'm gonna win this thing.
And I'm David Kastenbaum.
Thanks for listening.
You'll get credit in the straight world
Look a dealer in the eye
You'll get credit in the real world
Won't you try?
