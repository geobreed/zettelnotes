The way I see it the first job of my administration is to put people back to work and get our economy moving again
Hi and welcome to a special edition of NPR's Planet Money. I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington DC and in New York
I'm Laura Conaway. We are posting this podcast on Monday, January 19th
But we're recording it ahead of time because of the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday in this show
We want to consider the situation for Barack Obama
Of course because the inauguration is Tuesday January 20th and we'll get to that in a second
But first our indicator for today is 41 billion dollars
That is part of the 825 billion dollars stimulus package being drawn up by House Democrats
And it's the amount they say should be given to school districts serving poor and disabled students
And it's also for school construction and we just have to say we have no idea what that number means
I don't know if it works out to two teachers per school and new windows basketballs new air for the basketballs
I really have no idea right
So we are going to be taking an in-depth look at some parts of the stimulus package and we want your guidance
What parts do you want us to dig into check it out?
we'll post the stimulus package documents on our blog npr.org slash money and
Every we'll start by sketching out some of the areas that are being proposed in the house right now
There's a 54 billion dollars for a smarter electrical grid and for renewable energy
Six billion dollars to bring the internet to rural areas
Anyway, take a look and let us know you can also email us at planet money at NPR org
And we're gonna do our best in all of this
We keep hearing that president-elect Obama has been studying Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Who famously took office right in the middle of the Great Depression?
So as President Obama begins his first hundred days
We thought it would make sense to look back at FDR's first hundred days and who better to talk to about that than?
Eric Roushway, he's an economic historian
He's the author of the Great Depression and the New Deal a very short introduction
Roushway gave our colleagues Adam Davidson and Alex Bloomberg a very short introduction to the opening measures of Roosevelt's presidency
So Roosevelt comes and the first thing is let's save the banks because the banks are in deep dire strays
5,000 bank failures of the past, you know four years and is that they've begun to accelerate recently
So the first thing they do is to shut down the banks and
To audit all of them and then to reopen those that are determined to be sound and this is pretty amazing
It was a week that they shut it. Well, it was roughly a week
Moli will later say Raymond Moli Roosevelt's principal advisor in this crisis will later say capitalism was saved in eight days
So let's say eight days
So no banks are open. Whatever money you've got in your pocket is all the money you're gonna have
Yeah, and people barter and people, you know
The Dow company you famously mints its own money out of magnesium for a little bit
So its employees can have a trading medium and things like that
So there are various resources people near the borders use either Cade in Canadian or Mexican currencies things like that
But basically, yeah, you can't go get your money Wow
Okay, and then bank holiday bank holiday. This is the bank holiday. Good bad. Did it work bank holiday?
Generally, everybody thinks the bank holiday gets high marks
Right because now you have the federal government seal of approval on these banks when they are reopened people come and they put
Their money back in them, which was the big problem is that people were taking their money out of the banks
And there were runs on the banks
This is also the beginning that lays the basis for the federal government standing behind your deposit
So it's the basis for the federal deposit insurance corporation, which doesn't exist yet in the first hundred doesn't exist yet
And it becomes a temporary measure and then is made permanent later in the New Deal
Yeah, so that's that's that's sort of the first thing. The first thing we do is let's save the banks, right?
So that's number one
The second thing that's sort of the next highest priority for the Roosevelt administration is to balance the budget
Which is not what we would think of now and I don't think anyone's really talking about now as a priority but in those days
Especially with Roosevelt at the helm. This was regarded as a priority as a measure of responsibility
That you were going to get your house in order and so they passed the economy act with Roosevelt's blessing to try to
Make sure the federal government remained in the black and that is stayed to day three
I
But but but this is the next this probably in the afternoon for yeah
This probably would have been the first bill had it not been for the banking crisis, right?
We would have been the budget balancing bill. Okay, which not a success
I mean not seen as a helpful not seen as something that we hope Obama President-elect Obama will be doing
I don't think anybody's recommending it to my knowledge. Anyway, nobody very prominent is recommending it
And indeed, you know Roosevelt himself almost immediately fudges on this because they have the balanced budget
But then they also have the emergency budget which is off the books of the balanced budget where they do all those sort of the
New Deal II things that begin to provide people relief and things like that. What's number three?
Number three, you know is the agricultural adjustments act. I think you would have to point to as number three
This is this is important to remember that this is a period where a very large number of Americans are still employed in farming
The crisis in farming actually begins well before what we think of as the Great Depression proper and really has been going on since World
War one more or less now in a way
This is partly just growing pains people are simply moving to cities and off the land and farming is as a sector becoming less
important to the American economy
It's also becoming much more mechanized and so people are becoming what they call tractored out because the tractor comes in there's fewer jobs
therefore for hands also for mules as it happens in the
American economy
but partly it's a result of you know sort of some to some extent environmental
Dispoliation because you're going to get your dust bowl here
And so you need to do something to prop up farm prices and to make farmers whole and the agricultural adjustment act
Picks up a bunch of ideas that have been floating around really since the 1890s
To try to help farmers and they want to give farmers the equivalent of the protective tariff
Which has been long the way that America subsidized manufacturers
For the farm sector and the way they do this is they levy a tax on production of commodities
And then they pay it back to farmers to not produce
Crops, so this is where we get that idea you get the beginning of the yeah
It goes through several permutations before you get the system we have now
But this is broadly speaking the beginning of that idea and so you're going to limit production
That's going to push up prices and farmers will be happier
No, I I do know that I would say the vast majority of economists think that after World War two
This should have been eliminated and farming subsidies are a you know, I think most economists would use something like national disgrace and absurdity
In fairness, we're not alone. Other countries have their own disgraceful agricultural policies, but yes, right, right
but
In the context of the Great Depression was it a national disgrace then or was it helpful?
Oh, and by the way, you can send those angry letters to
The you know national disgrace is probably a bit strong
But it's it's not a real success
Obviously either I mean in in the midst of people actually going hungry you are destroying the means to feed them infamously
there is the slaughter of the little piglets right because they're getting rid of the
Shoots, I think they are right the pigs that have just been born. So to make sure that there's a scarcity of
Pigs later and the pig farmers will be doing so in a country where more than half of people are not working in agriculture
You're doing a policy that helps that minority that works in agriculture and hurting that majority that works out of agriculture
You need to eat what the agricultural people are making right? So the farmers love it. Everybody else not quite so much, you know, so
The big things I think of in the Great Depression Works Progress Administration
Tennessee Valley Authority
The massive massive increase in the size and scope of the government is that first hundred days?
The Tennessee Valley Authority is the first hundred days the Works Progress Administration is 35 that's later
You can claim that the roots of it are planted in the first hundred days
So let me quickly talk about those things. The TVA is really
vital in many ways to understanding the New Deal. It's a
Broadly speaking a regional authority that's supposed to do flood control and provide electricity
Through one of the most chronically impoverished parts of the south
But it's also has mandates to basically
economically develop that chronically impoverished part of the house in any way that they possibly can and so this not only means
Electricity this means watershed management. This means reforestation. This means trying to prevent soil erosion means
Developing new kinds of fertilizers that can be used for more efficient use of the soils
It means doing work through the agricultural colleges of the region and employing people directly to do all of these things
So it's a massive mobilization of scientists of engineers and of the the people of the Tennessee Valley area
And it is broadly successful
The Tennessee Valley area is much more prosperous after the TVA gets through with it than it ever was
You know leading up to the TVA
the the big
Relief programs that will become so essential as a New Deal particularly the Works Progress Administration won't come till
1935 but the basis of it comes in the first hundred days
There's the Public Works Administration, which is the really giant Public Works program comes in and the
Federal Emergency Relief Administration
Which is to try to employ unemployed people for short periods just to tide them over
Comes in and out of those you can see growing the big Public Works programs like the WPA
also to some extent things like that will be made permanent in the Social Security Act are kind of
Foreshadowed in the FERA the Emergency Relief in that first hundred days
Yeah, so you're you're you're using the federal government to give money to the states to give to the unemployed
Which is roughly the structure that you're gonna see erected in in in Social Security
All right, so we're running out of time, but it sounds to me like between March 4th
1933 and what is it June 15th or whatever hundred days are
We live in a fundamentally different country
The government's role in the economy is is is forever changed
You've seen the government's role in the economy dramatically increased now
It's important to note that it won't be very long before it's actually reeled back, right?
some of the things that are done in the first hundred days are very
Quickly regarded as practical failures and slightly after that regarded as unconstitutional
Congress is so eager to solve the problems of the Great Depression that they seed Roosevelt more power
Than the Supreme Court will say is consistent with the Constitution
The Agricultural Adjustment Act will be struck down the National Recovery Act will be struck down and
It will require the New Dealers to come up with different ways of doing the exact of doing similar things
Yeah, and then just one last question any lessons should Obama do the exact same things in his first hundred days
Should he do none of those things? I don't think you will see or the balanced budget idea coming forward
I do think you will see more of the public works kinds of things and probably more enthusiastic devotion
To public works and you actually saw in the first bit of the Roosevelt administration
Laura it's it'll be interesting to see if Eric Rashway's predictions come true. Yeah, let's actually switch gears here for a second
Okay, listeners have been asking to hear from people who are doing well
Because there are a lot of people who are not we have a seven point two percent unemployment
But that means most people still have jobs last week
I talked to one of the most employable people on the planet. His name is Nathan Fiala. He's 25
He's a mechanical engineer. He does environmental and energy work in North Dakota
Where amazingly the unemployment rate is just three point three percent Nathan's lab at the University of North Dakota
He says jobs there go begging engineers there have to compete for grants. Nobody's guaranteed a salary
There's no automatic state funding and still the money keeps coming in. He says they get two new contracts a week
I just got one today
Project manager won a
$100,000 award for some mercury sampling and you know, I get some of those
You know, I get about two two or three a week
so
We have a lot of money coming in here
and I think it's just mostly because of the attitude of the people that work here they go out after the
contract so no, I I
Don't get the sense that anybody here is worried about keeping a job at all
We read a lot back here on the East Coast where I work
About North Dakota having trouble actually finding enough workers to fill all the jobs the state has right now. I think that's
Spot-on exactly true
we have
Where I work. I just walked by the bulletin board downstairs and they've got I think two positions open one for a
research engineer
Starting out at 50,000 and I see you know help wanted signs pretty much every day
We've got a lot of work and not enough people to do it so are you exactly right?
Are you meeting new people moving into North Dakota yet for the work? Not really?
You know, the only downside of working here is I think it was minus 24 degrees air temperature
Like the last three days in a row so that's you know keeps the riff-raff out I guess
David that's the view from Grand Forks, North Dakota land of great hope and Nathan Fiala folks
We're gonna try and bring you more voices from people and jobs that are doing well in this economy
So keep those stories coming for now. That's a wrap. We'll be back podcasting on Wednesday and on Tuesday
We'll be observing the presidential inauguration of course on the blog by taking apart the stimulus plan
Come help us at npr.org slash money because you know, we need the help. I'm David Kastenbaum and I'm Laura Conoway. Thanks for listening
Are you
