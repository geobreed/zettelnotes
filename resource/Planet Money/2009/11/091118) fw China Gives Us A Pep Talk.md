NPR business correspondent Frank Langfitt headed to China a few weeks ago expecting to find a triumphant people. The Chinese economy has recovered much more quickly than many parts of the world and Langfitt says he thought people would be gloating. But that just wasn't the case, instead Langfitt found himself being comforted by the Chinese about the strength of the United States. Many people he spoke to said their country still has a long way to go before overtaking the U.S. economy. Part of the reason, factory workers in the southern part of the country have seen layoffs that Langfitt says, just can't be compared to Detroit. Returning to factories he had visited years ago, Langfitt found doors locked and furniture strewn about outside. Why's that? It's simple — Americans have stopped buying.

**faster whisper:**
President Obama and I spoke positively of the progress made in the China-U.S. relationship
since the new American administration took office.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. Today is Wednesday, November 18th. I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson. That was Chinese President Hu Jintao speaking through a
translator you heard at the top. And today on the podcast, we have a conversation about China
with NPR's own Frank Langfit. He just got back from a trip throughout Asia.
I have to say, Adam, it's a pretty fascinating conversation. Frank lived in China from 1997
to 2002 and visited again several times. The last visit was during the Olympics.
And he says it's unbelievable how much the country's changed even since his last trip there.
We'll get to all of that in a minute. But first, of course, as per tradition,
the Planet Money Indicator. And as per tradition, you are making wrinkling sounds
of a perfectly unrelated piece of paper. I'm just trying to add a little drama.
As if we live in the old world where the indicator come over like teletype or something
like that. You're not fooling anybody. I feel like Ira taught me that it's nice
to create a three-dimensional sense of space. Go for it. I think it's working.
All right. Well, the indicator is a dismal 10.6%.
That is housing starts. They dropped by 10.6% in October. And housing starts is one of
those economic indicators you hear that actually is exactly what it says it is,
the number of new home constructions that started in a given month.
So for the previous few months, over the summer and into the early fall, there was
a lot more new homes being built. And a lot of economists were saying, hey, that's good news.
The housing market is coming back. Home builders are optimistic.
People are willing to invest in new houses.
And take advantage of the tax credit on new home purchases.
Right. And that seems to be the issue. People are not so sure how long the tax
credit is going to be available. And when a building is constructed, often it's a
company that's building it on spec, hoping that someone will buy it. But those companies
are worried that a few months from now, maybe people won't be buying so many homes.
So they started building a lot fewer homes than economists thought they would be.
One more sign that the US economy might not be growing. One place where the
economy is growing, Adam, thank you, is, of course, China, which brings us to Frank Langford,
our NPR reporter, just back from a visit there.
Frank was in Asia for a total of 17 days. He spent the first week in Taiwan and the rest of
the time visiting different cities in mainland China. He told us that when he went there,
he was bracing for an attitude from the Chinese. The Chinese, he says, have gotten
a little frustrated being lectured to all the time by the US on financial matters.
And he thought that this might be a time for him as a representative of the US to
get the lectures himself, to hear a lot of gloating given our recent financial meltdown.
When I got to the mainland, I expected more triumphalism, you know, and I think maybe at
the high end with the top business people in China, you would probably get the, you know,
you guys have lectured us for a long time and now look what you've done.
But when I started talking about our economy, I got some really interesting reactions. Like,
there was one cabbie, I was telling him about all our problems and we have so many people
unemployed in the United States and the economy's coming back really slowly.
And he kind of looked at me and said, you guys are a developed economy. We're still
relatively poor. And, you know, it was funny because he was kind of bucking me up and it
wasn't, it wasn't, and it wasn't actually politeness because it was like one or two
people and they paused before they answered. Then you know, they're just being polite.
But this was like, he looked at me kind of funny, like you're not seeing the big
picture here. And so as I talked to more and more Chinese, people would say, yes, you guys have
really screwed up. And yes, we're really on a roll and we're very confident,
but your economy is still two and a half to three times the size of ours. And if you go
outside of Beijing, people are still relatively poor.
And was it sort of like, were they actually trying to make you feel better or were they
like sort of like a little fed up, like you're like the super model running off
about how fat you are? No, it was really, it wasn't that it
really was sort of a, I mean, it's the funniest thing, but it was more like, you know,
things are bad right now, but you know, Chinese, they think of history in a much longer
terms than we do. And they were sort of saying, see the big picture, you're missing
the big picture. Now the estimates when you talk to economists there and elsewhere are
somewhere in the 2025, 2027 range that their economy will in sort of gross terms,
probably pass ours given the pace at which they're growing. But even then, one of the
things people point out is that the per capita income is so dramatically different.
You know, in the States it's, it's over 40,000. Right now in China, it's about
3200 bucks. So the average American is over 10 times over 12 times richer.
I mean, honestly, it's almost, it's impossible to imagine a China that ever
would have the per capita income that we would have. They destroy the country
through consumption and pollution and everything. So still relatively speaking,
and as people say, you know, you go half an hour outside of Beijing and you know,
you're, you're with dirt farmers and their life is much better than it was during the
culture revolution, but it bears no resemblance to, you know, rural life in America.
And what about the other salient fact in Chinese cities is all the migrant workers.
I mean, you see these rich, fancy people, but then you see those migrant workers are
substantially poorer than Americans and substantially poorer than the rich people
in China. So are they just locked out? Is there an economy for them?
There is. It's complicated. I went to this, I spent three hours at a mall,
a place called Xin Kong Place, which is a new mall and it's all luxury,
you know, Burberry, Fendi, all the places you and I shop out at them.
But I went there and I was, I was asking Alex really does shop.
Alex does. Yes. Well, I went there and I asked people to basically open
their shopping bags and show me what they had bought. And there were like $350 coach
bags and, you know, $500 silk scarves. And I was like, this is, I didn't know how some
of the people were affording it. That $350 coach bag, that's at least two months,
two and a half months salary for a lot of factory workers down in South China.
And that's actually where I was on another story during part of this trip.
And what's interesting there is a lot of people, they had laid off, you know,
they laid off millions and millions of workers down there in the last year because Americans
stopped buying. So a lot of these people who had moved from the countryside to the factories
where they do relatively better than they do farming, you know, they've been sent back home.
They've had to go back home and find there are some inland factories that are developing.
Some of them take what earnings they have and go back to smaller towns and start
businesses. But it does speak to the dramatically different experiences. I mean,
when you're in some of these and they're not that many of them, but you go to some of
these high-end malls in Beijing and it's like Rodeo Drive. And then you go to the factory towns
and people are, you know, a lot of people are laid off and they're headed for the bus
and that kind of thing. It's just a completely different experience.
Did it feel like Detroit? Or I mean, how is it similar? How is it different?
Another place you've spent a lot of time.
Yeah, I mean, it was dramatically worse than Detroit because the scale is extraordinary.
I mean, you know, in Detroit, when you talk about the car companies,
you're talking about tens and thousands, maybe a couple hundred thousand jobs in the last two
or three years. In South China, you're talking about millions upon millions of jobs.
I would go back to factories that I'd been visiting two years ago and they were locked
up and abandoned and there was just furniture strewn all over the place.
I mean, people had just headed out because they were just not the orders from the United
States. And of course, people, there was this one person I was talking to told me
that they were running like three and four buses a day back to one small town in Sichuan
province because that's where all the workers came from. And they just had so many people who
wanted to go back home. So there was a sense there that in terms of the factory economy that
maybe it would, you know, it would come back. They were beginning to hire again now that they
saw a little more demand from the United States. But there were people I interviewed
who had cut their factory staffs from three hundred and thirty five hundred people to five
hundred people in just a year. So it's really, really dramatic.
Now, you know, you keep hearing that the entire Chinese economy is based on U.S.
consumption, U.S. people buying goods that were made in China. Is that
not true for all those nouveau riche in Beijing and Shanghai?
No. I mean, those people are not in the factory business. Some of them, I think,
have been making money through real estate. Right now, there's a feeling that because of
some of the changes the Chinese government has made in terms of, you know, cutting
mortgage interest rates, pumping a lot of money into the mortgage market.
All that government stimulus.
Essentially.
And they did what our government did. They spent five hundred and thirty billion dollars,
something like that, which is bigger to the size of their economy than our stimulus
spending on bridges and roads and all that stuff. Right.
Much more. And what's interesting in talking to some of my Chinese friends is many of them
feel that the place is in a property bubble now.
The estimate is somewhere in the neighborhood of about a third of the economy is export
driven. There's a lot of money that comes out of investment and the market.
But only a third. I mean, you almost get the sense a hundred percent of the economy.
It's not anymore. It's still very it's still very important.
It's still in many ways. And there's a lot of debate over that because some
people will point out that when you take a lot of the products that the components that
come into the country and that are assembled in China and then sent on to the United States,
that the actual value added in China isn't that great.
And so some people will say that it's not as much of an export oriented
economy as it appears to be and therefore may not have been hit as hard
as one might expect, given the downturn in American consumption.
That said, having just spent, you know, about four or five days in the factory towns
of South China, I mean, it was it was like war.
I mean, factories wiped out, workers laid off and, you know, having, you know,
lost their jobs and just got on the bus and headed home.
So it's dramatically different than it was two years ago.
And I was also interested. You said you went to Taiwan.
I remember when I first got to China the first time I went, it felt like mainland China,
at least the export oriented manufacturing sector.
It's almost like an arm of Taiwan.
I mean, the factories were owned by Taiwan.
The managers, you know, seem to be Taiwanese, had a Taiwan orientation.
But we don't hear as much about Taiwan, I feel like, in the last few years.
Is Taiwan kind of losing it a little bit?
It's very interesting. I mean, the Taiwanese managers, you're exactly right.
They have the greatest competitive advantage in the China market because they speak
Mandarin really, really well and they understand the culture of the mainland.
They're even better than the Singaporeans in terms of doing well in business in China.
What's happened more recently is the Taiwanese feel like they're really falling behind.
China is now with the ASEAN countries trying to develop a free trade zone.
But because China has so much influence and it looks at Taiwan as a renegade province,
nobody will do free trade agreements with Taiwan.
And they were afraid that when this free trade zone begins to emerge next year,
they're going to be shut out.
So right now they're trying to do an economic cooperative agreement with China
and they're beginning to open up economic ties in a way that they've resisted for decades.
And they sort of feel like this is essential to their survival.
And what I found fascinating, I hadn't been to Taiwan since 2000 and back then
it was a really defiant kind of island independent country.
But the Taiwanese economy has really struggled since then.
And now there's this sense on the island that their future is tied to the Chinese economy,
that they have to have a much more cooperative relationship with mainland China and Beijing.
And you really get a sense that they don't feel like they have a whole lot of choice in the
matter. And that economics, the economic power of China is really driving the politics
across the Taiwan Straits.
All right. Thank you to Frank Lankford for taking the time to talk to us.
We will link to a lot of the great stories that he's done from his trip to China

We're excited about that.
We are very excited. Gateway to the West.
Exactly. So please do send your emails to planetmoney at npr.org.
