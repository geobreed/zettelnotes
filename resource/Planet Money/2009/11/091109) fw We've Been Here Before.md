When people talk about the current economic crisis they bring up the Great Depression and Japan's lost decade, but the world's history of 'financial folly' spans much larger, through eight centuries and 66 different countries. In their new book, This Time Is Different, economist Ken Rogoff of Harvard, and Carmen Reinhart of University of Maryland, tell the stories of financial crises from medieval currency debasements to the recent subprime mess. Reinhart says our current troubles are nothing new, and what's worse, she predicts we're doomed to repeat the mistakes of our predecessors.

From This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly:

The This-Time-Is-Different Syndrome

    The essence of the this-time-is-different syndrome is simple. It is rooted in the firmly held belief that financial crises are things that happen to other people in other countries at other times; crises do not happen to us, here and now. We are doing things better, we are smarter, we have learned from past mistakes. The old rules of valuation no longer apply. The current boom, unlike the many booms that preceded catastrophic collapses in the past (even in our country), is built on sound fundamentals, structural reforms, technological innovation, and good policy. Or so the story goes.

    In the preamble we have already provided a theoretical rationale for the this-time-is-different syndrome based on the fragility of highly leveraged economies, in particular their vulnerability to crises of confidence. Certainly historical examples of the this-timeis-different syndrome are plentiful. It is not our intention to provide a catalog of these, but examples are sprinkled throughout the book.

    A short list of the manifestations of the syndrome over the past century is as follows:

    1. The buildup to the emerging market defaults of the 1930s

    Why was this time different? The thinking at the time: There will never again be another world war; greater political stability and strong global growth will be sustained indefinitely; and debt burdens in developing countries are low.

    The major combatant countries in World War I had built up enormous debts. Regions such as Latin America and Asia, which had escaped the worst ravages of the war, appeared to have very modest and manageable public finances. The 1920s were a period of relentless global optimism, not dissimilar to the five-year boom that preceded the worldwide financial crisis that began in the United States in mid-2007. Just as global peace was an important component of the 2000s dynamic, so was the widely held view that the experience of World War I would not soon be repeated.

    In 1929, a global stock market crash marked the onset of the Great Depression. Economic contraction slashed government resources as global deflation pushed up interest rates in real terms. What followed was the largest wave of defaults in history.

**faster whisper:**
The U.S. economy and the global economy are now growing again.
Businesses are just starting to invest again.
Consumers are now spending.
Business and consumer confidence has improved.
Global trade is now expanding at an encouraging pace.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt.
Today is Monday, November 9th.
And that was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
You just heard at the top of the podcast, he was speaking at the G20 Economic Summit
in Scotland that happened over the weekend.
And on the podcast today, eight centuries of financial folly.
But first, Alex, our Planet Money Indicator, the indicator today is 21.
Twenty-one, as in 21 percent, the percentage of mortgage owners who were underwater on
their homes this past fiscal quarter.
That is, they owed more on their mortgages than their homes were actually worth.
This according to Zillow.com, a Seattle-based real estate data company.
Now, this is a very, very high number.
Ideally, no one is ever underwater, but this number, 21 percent, is actually good
news because it's down from the previous number.
It used to be 23 percent.
Of course, one reason fewer people are underwater, more people are losing their
homes to foreclosure.
Almost a million people filed for foreclosure last quarter, nearly a 25 percent increase
in foreclosure filings from the year earlier.
Wow.
So one way to stop being underwater in your home is to lose your home completely.
Which brings us, Hana, to today's podcast, which is a look at financial calamities, eight
centuries basically of financial disaster.
Something we've heard from economists for the last year or two years is that we don't
have enough economic data, especially when it comes to figuring out what to do
in a severe downturn like the one we're in.
We have the Great Depression, Japan's lost decade, and that's about it.
It's hard to prevent another crisis or fix the existing one when you just don't have
enough information about what's going on.
But now we've got a whole new data set thanks to a new book from Carmen
Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, which looks at financial crises going back as far as eight
centuries.
Yeah.
The book is called This Time Is Different, Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.
And the book actually took quite a bit of detective work on the part of the authors
because banking crises in the 1800s and earlier, they weren't exactly well documented.
So this book is written by Ken Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard, and Carmen
Reinhart. She's a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.
And our colleague, Adam Davidson, sat down to talk with her.
It is more akin to archaeology than economics, you know, parts of the putting
together of this database.
There were moments that were really exciting.
Those were the discovery moments.
So, for example, when we found out that we could actually get data on real estate
prices, as we, you know, you know, from people's anecdotes that, boy, real
estate prices were booming before the before the crisis.
And of course, we can document it for the United States.
But trying to document that outside for other crises was a real challenge.
And when we started actually finding the data on real estate prices, that was a
big. You mean from, like, the 1820s in Germany?
Well, I mean, from the 1800s, it's only a very small set of countries, some of
the Scandinavian countries, the UK, the U.S., Holland, you know, but even
post-war data is on real estate prices is hard to come by when you're
looking at that as many countries as we are.
And that was a big fun moment, a big exciting moment when you discover that
you can actually make some headway in that direction.
But there were incredible moments of just sheer frustration.
And this is never going to end.
And, you know, one gets antsy when the task is seems, you know, seems
so so far away.
And now I want to move into the lesson.
All right. So first of all, the title of your book is This Time is Different.
A bit of irony there, right?
Indeed, a lot.
Yeah. So so let's talk about this financial crisis we've been through
here in the U.S.
Is it different or is it just a totally standard financial crisis of the
last 800 years?
It's it's pretty textbook.
It's pretty standard.
If you look at the antecedents of the crisis, the the private sector became
heavily indebted, saving rates in the United States plummeted to all time
lows, household indebtedness rose to all time highs, current account
deficits huge.
We were borrowing from the rest of the world.
Real estate prices were booming.
Equity prices were booming.
Those features are present ahead of the major financial blowouts.
So the idea of OK, so one key feature that this crisis shares with many most
of the past crises is just borrowing a lot, borrowing a lot, basically
living high on the hog, borrowing from the future without a realistic
ability to pay for that debt.
And why would that be?
Because this time is different.
This time we don't have to worry about, you know, the mortgage payment
problem because housing prices are going to go up forever and the
collateral that we have is going to go up forever.
That's that was the expectation that.
And that's a standard thing you see throughout these crises.
Some reason why this time we don't have to worry about exactly the
rules of valuation.
You know, you talk about price earnings ratios.
No, they don't apply here.
The rules of valuation simply apply to other people in other places.
They don't apply to us in the here and now.
So there will always be a story.
And in our case, if you recall, much of the discussion during the
boom phase was that we had tamed the business cycle.
This was called the great moderation.
Yeah.
And you had Alan Greenspan and many top economists, maybe even Ken
Rogan himself, saying we no longer had to worry about inflation like we used to.
We had 25 years of of steady growth without any real fear of inflation.
And maybe this was a new era.
Indeed, indeed.
And did you say that, by the way, were you one of the many economists who
believed we were in a period of great moderation that we had?
No, remember, you have to believe you have to see my work on emerging markets.
Emerging markets make you very jaded very quickly.
Okay.
I have seen to, I've been working on financial crises for 15 years, if not
longer, and I have seen too many of these booms and busts one.
Let me tell you about one important experience that helped me interpret
what was going on in the U S I traveled to Asia in 1995, right after
the Mexican peso crisis and Asia at the time was borrowing like crazy
from the rest of the world.
They had booms in real estate, booms in, in, in stock markets, big debt
buildup, but no, those crises happen in Latin America.
They happen in Mexico.
They don't happen in Asia.
This is, uh, we're different.
We're different.
Yeah, we're different.
Uh, we have high savings rates.
Those, those, we have Asian values.
That was the line at the time.
So I was very jaded going into this, uh, because of
the emerging market experience.
What can we expect now?
Um, what, what, what are the long-term, are we going to be poorer?
Are we going to be wiser?
Are we going to be stupider?
What, what happens now based on what you saw in history?
Um, are we going to be wiser?
I don't think so.
Um, unfortunately, we humans tend to have short memories.
I think for a while, while the memories are still with us, there will be more
of a prudent stance towards taking on debt, uh, because the burn is within memory.
Um, so that, that I think is something that going forward, uh, for, for a while,
I think households and, and in particular, uh, will be more, more circumspect.
Gotcha.
But, but that's what five years, 10 years, maybe 20 years.
Yeah.
And after that, I'll bet they're off.
It's just back to this time is different.
Uh, yes.
I mean, I wish I, I wish I had a more uplifting, uh, conclusion, but you
know, um, there is the tendency again to think, well, you know, we, we're,
we're the cavemen, you know, that's what we will be perceived as, you
know, 25, 30 years from now, uh, in the book in, in, in this time is different.
In the book, we have a wonderful ad that reads as follows.
It says, you know, we don't have to repeat the, the mistakes of, of
the, uh, South sea bubbles.
We are a sophisticated, we have, uh, analytical tools to tell us about
balance sheets of companies.
We are standard statistics.
This was an advertisement, which appeared, uh, in September, 1929,
um, you know, a couple of weeks, uh, before the crash.
Um, Peter Lindert, uh, the, the, uh, historian economic historian,
um, from university of California, uh, sent this beautiful illustration
of this time is different, uh, to me.
Um, when, when the book was being written, uh, and it's, I think it,
it goes to the heart of your question.
So by 2030, people will be saying, Oh, that thing back in 2008, who cares?
No, no, here's, they were doing this wrong, but we've figured it out.
We, yes.
And, and, and even then, and the next one doesn't even have to be here.
You know, I mean, remember what I said earlier that, Oh yeah, those
things, those things happen in Latin America, they don't happen in Asia.
Well, somebody else can, you know, in China or somewhere else can say, Oh,
those things happen in the United States.
They don't happen here.
You know, uh, so the next, the next one doesn't have to be here.
Uh, but, but, uh, but it's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
All right, Hannah, you've been warned.
I sort of hope that if you look back beyond the time that we do have
data for that, the lesson might be different than we just repeat our
mistakes over and over and over again.
Right.
Well, I guess you have to keep on trying not to repeat them as
inevitable as it might seem.
Um, I think that wraps it up for us here today on Planet Money.
