Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds.com, defends his company's latest report about the effectiveness of the much-hyped and recently closed Cash for Clunkers program. Edmunds found the program added only 125,000 in sales at a cost of $3.5 billion, or $24,000 per new car. But Austin Goolsbee, a University of Chicago economist currently serving as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, doesn't think those numbers are right. His analysis puts the number of Cash for Clunkers sales closer to 450,000.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today is Friday, November 13. That was an ad for the famous Cash for Clunkers program you heard at the top. That's the topic of today's podcast. But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator.

JOFFE-WALT: (Vocalizing) The indicator is $35.6 billion.

KESTENBAUM: That is how much the U.S. trade deficit widened in September. The trade deficit is the difference between how much we buy from the rest of the world - imports - and how much we sell to the rest of the world - exports. The increase from August was the largest jump in nearly a decade.

JOFFE-WALT: And the deficit rose largely because of that imports side of thing. Imports rose 5.8%, meaning we're buying more. And specifically in September, we are buying more oil and foreign cars.

KESTENBAUM: So buying is one sign the economy may be starting to heal. And some people would say that is in part - thank you - to the stimulus. The stimulus helped with housing, helped with cars, helped with building roads. And as we've pointed out on this podcast, the country is in the midst of one of the biggest economic experiments in history.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, so the economy got itself into some trouble. And earlier this year, the government decided to dust off an old idea. It was an idea put forth by a guy named John Maynard Keynes many decades ago, and the idea being that the thing to do in big recessions is spend. The government should spend lots of money and get the economy going again.

KESTENBAUM: So the stimulus package was huge - $787 billion. And I'd like to think that at the end, many years from now, we will know - you know, smart people will look at the data and they will agree that the stimulus helped or that it hurt. Maybe that's naive of me, but that is my great hope. Anyway, today we are going to look at one small part of the stimulus effort to try to get an answer. Did it work as intended?

JOFFE-WALT: And I think we can satisfy part of that dream, David, because the Cash for Clunkers program is now over. So we're thinking we may be able to start some of that dissection now. We're going to talk to one man who is pretty sure that he already has an answer.

KESTENBAUM: So just to remind everyone, the way the program worked was that if you owned a clunker car - a car that didn't get great gas mileage - you could trade it in and buy one that got better gas mileage. And the government would help you out by giving you $3,500 or $4,500 - giving you money to help buy that new car.

JOFFE-WALT: And the question is, did the program get people to trade in their cars who wouldn't have done it anyway? This is a tricky question 'cause, remember, the idea is to stimulate demand. You try to entice people who wouldn't have traded in their cars for years to do it right now.

KESTENBAUM: So this is how I like to think about it. I like to think about the kind of people who might trade in their cars. So the program really kicked in in August. And say I was going to trade in my car in August. Well, I'm going to do it anyway. I'm going to take the check from the government. That's great for me. And the government didn't really want to target those people but too bad. You know, you have to. They're going to trade in the car, and the program's there.

There are other people who were going to maybe trade in their car the next month, in September, who decided to do it in August instead - a month early. That's also not really great because then you're just giving people money to trade in their car one month earlier than they would have otherwise. What you really want is people who weren't even thinking of trading in their cars. Maybe, like, a year later they would have traded in their cars, but they were not thinking about doing it then.

JOFFE-WALT: So, David, you talk to this guy who thinks he might know the answer. His name is Jeremy Anwyl. He's the CEO of edmunds.com, which analyzes the auto industry for consumers. And he told you, the folks at Edmunds had this idea for how to calculate whether or not Cash for Clunkers was working as designed.

KESTENBAUM: Right. So if you just chart the sales, you can see this huge spike around Cash for Clunkers. And Anwyl's team argues that, yes, there was this spike, but there was also a dip afterward. So if you add it all together, the program was not very stimulative.

JOFFE-WALT: Stimulative. Did you just make up that word?

KESTENBAUM: Is that not a word?

JOFFE-WALT: I don't think that's a word. I think you're trying to avoid saying stimulating.

KESTENBAUM: Stimulative. Anyway, I'm not going to respond to that. Look, here's the question - right? - how do you know it was a dip? That's the hard part to prove 'cause you got to know what the sales would have been like without Cash for Clunkers. So you can say, see, it's lower than that. So edmunds.com looked at the sales of cars that were not eligible - like, say, a Mercedes. And by looking at Mercedes sales, they estimated what the sales of other cars they think would have been without the Cash for Clunkers program. So here are the numbers they come up with. There were 690,000 cars bought through the Cash for Clunkers program. How many were new? How many of those would not have happened anyway in the following year? Here's his answer.

JEREMY ANWYL: I think what we're going to see is that it nets out at about 125,000 extra sales. These are sales that would not have happened if we had not had the program.

KESTENBAUM: So we spent three - so the government spent...

ANWYL: About two - yeah, 2.8 billion, I think, or - and change. That's what they ended up with.

KESTENBAUM: OK. And for that, you're saying all they got was 125,000 vehicles traded in that would not have been traded in otherwise.

ANWYL: Right. Yes. So it gets very expensive. I mean, you know, it's in the neighborhood of 24, $25,000 per extra sale.

KESTENBAUM: So his conclusion, Chana, is that the Cash for Clunkers program was a very expensive way for the government to stimulate those extra vehicle sales. It basically ended up costing $24,000 for every extra vehicle sold because the other ones would have happened anyway sometime within the coming year.

JOFFE-WALT: And there were a couple of people who weren't happy with this report, right?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, the White House.

JOFFE-WALT: The White House got very angry about edmunds.com's report. And they put this thing on their blog. I'm going to read it - "Busy Covering Car Sales On Mars, Edmunds.com Gets It Wrong (Again) On Cash For Clunkers."

KESTENBAUM: I talked to Jeremy Anwyl about this, and he said, sorry. You know, these are the numbers we get.

You think your model of extrapolating from the expensive cars is solid? I mean...

ANWYL: Well, we didn't just do expensive. I mean, you could look at any vehicle that didn't get at least, you know, 18 - I think it was - 18 MPG. So there's the whole category, or - it's not just luxury cars. You could look at other larger vehicles that didn't get great gas mileage. They weren't eligible either.

KESTENBAUM: And they all - each of those extrapolations gives you similar answers?

ANWYL: Yeah. Yeah, we went through this in every which way that you can think of.

KESTENBAUM: So the results seem solid to you.

ANWYL: Yes. We wouldn't have put it out if we didn't think so because I realize that this is really the first mathematically derived conclusion on the program. The - you know, all the original - all the other estimates were sort of conjecture. But this one is pretty solid.

KESTENBAUM: So economist Alan Blinder at Princeton, you know, he was a big advocate for this. What's he going to say if I call him up?

ANWYL: I'd be interested to hear (laughter).

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, David, I know you can't resist that kind of transition.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, I called him up.

ALAN BLINDER: Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton University.

KESTENBAUM: And you're on the Amtrak?

BLINDER: I'm on Amtrak right now.

KESTENBAUM: OK, podcast listeners, I apologize for the poor quality of the audio. This is the only time we could get him. Blinder said actually, though he proposed the program, supported the program, he actually thinks it was a failure because it didn't run long enough. He says you're going to get a dip when the program ends, so you want to run it as long as possible. So when it ends, you're in - close to out of the recession, you know? If you just run it for a month, he says, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people to trade in cars who weren't already thinking about it.

BLINDER: People don't react that fast. I mean, I think of myself. My son is driving a clunker that we wanted to actually trade in under this program. But the - you know, I'm doing a lot of other things in my life. And by the time I got - way before I got around to actually thinking about it, the program was over.

KESTENBAUM: I see, OK. All right, I was expecting you to defend it.

BLINDER: I defend the idea very much. When I wrote about this program in The New York Times - hang on one second. I'm sitting in the other car. I came in here to make a phone call. I'm in the quiet car. I was talking about a program that would last a year or two years, not a program that will last a month.

JOFFE-WALT: Did he just violate the rules of the quiet car?

KESTENBAUM: No. I think he was explaining why he didn't have his ticket because it was in the quiet car where he'd been sitting. And he'd stepped out to talk to National Public Radio on his cellphone.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, good. Because I really value the quiet car. OK, so even the guy who proposed this program doesn't quite think it worked out that well. We called up the White House's Council of Economic Advisers to get someone who could defend it. They gave us Austan Goolsbee. He's actually a professor at the University of Chicago and he's chief economist of the president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.

KESTENBAUM: And so Austan Goolsbee said the Council of Economic Advisers has looked at the various analyses for the Cash for Clunker program that are out there - or the numbers that are out there. And their conclusion is that on average, it resulted in way more than 125,000 cars being bought that wouldn't have been bought for a while.

AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Something like 450,000 to 500,000 of the 700,000 were new.

KESTENBAUM: OK, so Edmunds is saying 125,000...

GOOLSBEE: And we're saying, you know, 440,000 kind of thing.

KESTENBAUM: That's a huge difference.

GOOLSBEE: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: So, Chana, Austan Goolsbee and I went back and forth. And he says he thinks the Edmunds analysis is wrong. And it has to do with what you might call the control group if this were, you know, like, a high school experiment or something. Remember, you got to estimate how many cars would have been sold without the Cash for Clunkers program - right? - so you can know whether there's a dip or more sales. And Edmunds does this by looking at, like, Mercedes - some cars that weren't eligible for the program. So say you knew that for every Mercedes sold, typically you'd get one Honda Civic sold. So if a hundred Mercedes cars sell, then you figure a hundred Honda Civics would have sold.

JOFFE-WALT: In a normal scenario without Cash for Clunkers.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, in a normal scenario without Cash for Clunkers.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

KESTENBAUM: So Mercedes are not eligible for the program, Honda Civics are. So counting Honda Civics is kind of complicated. But if you count the Mercedes, that should be the same whether you have Cash for Clunkers or not. And that should tell you how many Honda Civics you think would have sold without the program. Then you can figure out how many were added by the program. That's the idea.

Anyway, Goolsbee says there's a potential flaw with doing it that way, which is that there was a lot of advertising during Cash for Clunkers. So it's possible that people went in and bought more Mercedes as a result of the Cash for Clunkers program. In which case, your control group is all messed up. And in fact, you're going to conclude that the Cash for Clunkers program didn't work very well when, in fact, it did.

JOFFE-WALT: So he's saying that it may be that even though Mercedes weren't eligible in the Cash for Clunkers program, the sales went up because there was just a lot of advertising for Cash for Clunkers?

KESTENBAUM: Right. You know, it created a lot of buzz, and people went in and bought cars, even if they weren't participating in the Cash for Clunkers program.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Now, the Council of Economic Advisers that Goolsbee is with didn't do their own economic analysis of this, but they did put out a paper in September trying to pull some numbers together.

GOOLSBEE: We laid out all the evidence that everybody has put forward of, what was the regular turn-in clunker rate? What's the regular purchase rate of these vehicles? How much higher did they go up? And I think almost everybody - there are numerous, numerous private sector analysts of the car market and even just - just put the graph up on the wall. It's totally obvious that Cash for Clunkers did something quite dramatic. And the decreases in auto demand that have followed it - you knew there would be a decline. They haven't been anything like the order of magnitude of how much the increase was. So I guess that would lead a lot of people to think that maybe the Edmunds case is way overstated.

KESTENBAUM: If it turns out Edmunds' site was right, would you agree that the Cash for Clunkers was a failure?

GOOLSBEE: To me, that's just - you're just trying to come up with loaded terms. I don't think even Edmunds would say that they said Cash for Clunkers was a failure. They're just trying to come up with - answering specific questions like...

KESTENBAUM: Well, you - right, but I mean, you did say the...

GOOLSBEE: ...How much did it cost? And what was the impact on GDP?

KESTENBAUM: But you did say...

GOOLSBEE: I would be happy to answer the question, what is the impact on GDP? How many jobs are created? How many cars were sold because of this program? How many cars got turned in?

KESTENBAUM: Right. I mean, but you did agree that the idea of a stimulus is to be encouraging people to do things that they - maybe they wouldn't have done for years to do now, right? And so, if it turns out...

GOOLSBEE: Yes, we're trying to shift economic activity into the present.

KESTENBAUM: Right. So if their analysis is right, that didn't really happen. In which case, it would seem like the Cash for Clunkers program was not - have a stimulating effect.

GOOLSBEE: Well, as I said, you're trying to attach a values label.

KESTENBAUM: Well, I'm just saying we have a goal...

GOOLSBEE: I'm happy - I'm an economist, so I'm happy answering data questions of, how much did it cost? What was the impact on GDP? What was the impact on job growth? What was the impact on the car industry?

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, man. So, David, remember how I was saying, oh, now that Cash for Clunkers is over, you can just look at it and say, did it work or did not work? Maybe it's too soon to do that.

KESTENBAUM: I - this is the thing I find frustrating about economics. I mean, we have a pretty simple stimulus program here. You know, you'd think there'd be the data that you could look at and tell whether it worked or not. And yet there is this disagreement. I have to say, both sides on this one - they do say, though, that in the end, there will be a lot more data that will be out there. And it should be clear. Jeremy Anwyl at edmunds.com, he says the GAO - the Government Accountability Office - is working on a report, and maybe they'll have access to data that's not public now. So maybe that will help clear things up.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Well, if you would like to see the data that does exist, we have reports from the Cash for Clunkers program on our blog, npr.org/money. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.
