When the government created the Medicare system in 1965, they were so desperate to get doctors into it that they allowed them set their own fees. The fee for service system was good for doctors, who now got paid for giving health care to the poor and elderly, but bad for the government. The crushing weight of doctors fees soon sent government budgets out of control. Ten years later, President Ford thought he had the solution, cap the fees paid to doctors. Unfortunately capping fees just caused another problem, overtreatment. It wasn't until the late 1980's that an economist from Harvard, Professor William Hsiao, finally came up with method to determine competitive prices for doctor's care — the relative value scale. Though this scale is used today, the problem of over paying doctors still exists. Hsiao, says that's because special interests have gotten a hold of his scale distorted it.

When the government created the Medicare system in 1965, they were so desperate to get doctors into it that they allowed them set their own fees. The fee for service system was good for doctors, but bad for the budget. Joseph Califano, was President Johnson's senior domestic policy aide at the time, and he says he and his colleagues simply didn't understand the economic structure of the health care system.

Ten years later, President Ford thought he had the solution to stem rising costs — cap the fees paid to doctors. Unfortunately this "fix," just caused another problem, overtreatment.

It wasn't until the late 1980's that an economist from Harvard, Professor William Hsiao, finally came up with method to determine competitive prices for doctor's care. Hsiao brought in doctors and asked them to rate every single thing they did based on how technically hard it was, how stressful, how much the supplies cost, etc. From this data, he developed the relative value scale. Medicare adopted the relative value scale in 1992, and it's still used today. However, the system has done little to cut rising costs — something Hsiao blames on special interest groups.

**faster whisper:**
We're not going to be bound by any timelines.
We need to do the best job we can for the American people.
We want quality legislation, and we're going to do that.
Hello, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Khanna Jafiwal.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today is Wednesday, November 4th.
That was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, you heard at the top, talking about passing
health care legislation.
The next indicator today actually is also about health care.
It comes in a letter from 40 years ago.
I have it here.
It's all yellow and crusty.
It's a message that President Johnson wrote to Congress in 1968, and the number is $100
billion, and he was using it as a warning.
In that message, Johnson wrote, quote, unless the cost spiral is stopped, the nation's
health bill could reach a staggering $100 billion by 1975.
When LBJ wrote that letter, that number shocked people.
A lot of people were like, come on.
You're being a little dramatic.
No.
1975 came around.
Health care spending was $133 billion.
Today, health care spending in the United States, over $2 trillion.
So today we have a question on the show, a question that LBJ struggled with in his
time, that Barack Obama struggles with today.
And it's one that seems pretty simple, but it has confounded policymakers and insurance
companies and patients for decades.
The question is, how do you pay a doctor?
And it is a question that we have failed to answer over and over and over again.
And that failure actually explains a lot about why our health care system costs so much.
Now, it turns out it is really hard to figure out how to pay a doctor, especially
for a government to figure out how to pay a doctor.
Right now, we are saddled with the system that it seems everyone, Republicans, Democrats,
insurers, health care expert people, all think is not working very well.
And that is the fee-for-service system.
So fee-for-service means doctors get a fee for every test, every exam, every doctor's
visit, which means the more they do, the more they make.
And most players in the system do not like this, especially the government, because
it ends up being very expensive.
So who came up with this system?
The government.
Yes.
The very entity that is being crushed by the enormous cost of paying doctors fee-for-service
created the fee-for-service system.
Well, not really created, but fee-for-service has been around forever.
But the government created a particularly bad version of it.
And it's one that is still causing us trouble today.
So, Hannah, we are going to try to understand how we got stuck here with some
time travel.
Caitlin, can you take us back to 1965?
Very nice.
All right.
So it's 1965.
And at this point, several U.S.
presidents have tried for universal health care, have tried to create some kind of
government-run health insurance.
And every last one has failed.
So Lyndon Johnson is in office, and he is determined he is going to be the one.
He is going to create Medicare for old people, Medicaid for poor people.
He is going to get it done.
But the doctors are not having it.
The American Medical Association representing doctors, the AMA, they're afraid of
socialized medicine, government intervention into their business.
So for those of you living in the future, that will sound familiar.
Anyway, he is determined not to fail like many presidents before him.
So Lyndon Johnson makes a concession.
It's a pretty big one.
And here it is.
Lyndon Johnson basically says, OK, doctors, tell us what you charge for the
things that you do, and we will pay it.
We talked to Joseph Califano.
He was LBJ's top assistant of domestic affairs in 1965.
And he says it was the worst kind of fee for service.
Instead of telling doctors how much we'll pay or negotiating a price, we just
said, doctors, tell us.
And Califano says the government did this because they really needed doctors
to participate.
If doctors didn't accept Medicare, if they wouldn't see patients covered by
Medicare, it would fail.
In order to get the doctors aboard, we had to agree to let them charge their
usual customer and prevailing fee.
That gave them the power to set their own fees.
And we put in cement the fee for service system with the doctor in
control.
Did you see how bad that was going to be?
No.
No.
We knew what things we were agreeing to would be cost.
We knew by giving the doctors the power to set their own fees, it would
cost a little more.
But we were worried about whether doctors would come into the Medicare
program.
The big issue was you're going to control medicine, you're going to have
socialized medicine, you're going to, you know, control the doctors.
We were on edge.
We were on edge.
About?
About whether doctors would agree to, you know, would agree to take
Medicare patients.
Why were you worried they wouldn't participate?
You were going to pay them whatever they wanted.
Because they were so opposed to it.
I mean, they were reluctantly.
It wasn't, believe me, within two years they loved it.
But they didn't really understand what a bonanza this was going to be
for them.
Almost overnight they were being paid for care that they had previously
just given to patients.
And I think that had an enormous impact on their incomes.
So before this moment, doctors, many of whom had been seeing poor
and elderly patients already for free or for a big discount, were now
being paid.
And not just being paid, but being paid their usual and customary fees,
basically what they asked for.
And I tracked down a couple doctors who were practicing when this
happened.
And actually more than one of them used that word bonanza in
describing the change.
Here's one, Dr. Lucian Leap.
He was a practicing surgeon at the time.
We found out what the general fee for a service was and charged
that or maybe added 10% because, of course, I'm better than average.
And so it was an incentive for doctors to charge what they thought
was reasonable for them and then, of course, to increase it every
year by, say, five or 10%.
Now, Hannah, having been a reporter all these years, you know,
it is really hard to get people in politics to say, man,
we screwed something up.
But Joe Califano, who worked with LBJ, he said, yeah,
we made some big mistakes.
We just did not understand all the consequences.
We didn't understand, I think it's fair to say, the full economic
structure of the system because we did some other things.
We passed legislation to double the number of doctors from 8,000
to 16,000 that were graduating from medical schools.
You passed legislation saying we're just going to have twice as
many doctors now?
Yeah.
We passed legislation to provide funds to medical schools to
double the number of doctors from 8,000 to 16,000 a year graduating.
And we built a lot of hospitals.
We thought doubling the number of doctors and building more
hospitals in the traditional economic sense of greater supply,
there'll be more competition, and prices will go down.
And what happened?
What happened was we had much greater supply.
There was no competition.
Prices kept going up.
Califano told us that he and his team and President Johnson,
they all realized they created something of a monster.
And pretty much right away, I mean, two years after Medicare
passed, LBJ is pleading with Congress to let him change the
way Medicare pays physicians.
By late 67, the budget data was just stunning.
I mean, in 1968, we knew that system should be changed.
We asked Congress for authority to change it.
But you just created it.
I know it.
But we saw what was happening with costs so fast, so fast.
We created it in 1965.
In early 68, in a message called Health in America,
we went to Congress and asked for authority to change that system.
And by this time, the doctors and hospitals who had so resisted
the system were now sitting at this groaning table full of food.
And they loved it.
And they were gluttonous.
And they were eating it up.
And they went to Congress and said, no, no, no, we love this.
We want it just the way it is.
And, David, that was it.
There was no turning back after this.
And pretty much as soon as Medicare said this is how we're
going to pay doctors, lots of private insurers adopted the
very same system.
So remember, Medicare is huge.
So what Medicare does can kind of set the rules.
This decision changed everything.
There was no turning back.
Now we're in 1975.
And as we said, this problem has not gone away.
In fact, it has gotten worse.
Health care spending has soared to a 13 percent annual rate increase.
And fee for service, to be fair, is not the only reason medicine is
getting better and it's getting more expensive, but is definitely part
of the problem.
And President Ford says we have to do something about this.
We can't just pay doctors whatever they ask for.
He realized he was not going to be able to get everyone to agree
to throw out this new customary fee for service model.
So he said, fine, we'll pay you what you want within limits.
He set caps on doctor pay.
Which sounds reasonable, except in this one decision, the
government actually set into motion another problem in health care today
that's a big problem right now, overtreatment.
So if you tell doctors the payment for a particular procedure is going to
be capped, one way for doctors to make sure that they get what they
think they should be paid is to do more.
Doctors, for the most part, of course, were doctors because they
wanted to help people.
But this, you know, for any human being, it's a clear incentive to do
more.
It's at least a nudge to err on the safe side, to order tests, to do
exploratory surgery.
OK.
So quick recap.
1965, the government puts fee for service into law, allows doctors to
charge the government what they choose.
1975, we say, OK, we can do this, but within limits, guys, and time
marches on and medicine gets really, really good.
Ah, the 1980s.
We've got MRIs.
We've got CT scans.
We've got organ transplants.
And we are getting into suing each other.
So now our doctors have really expensive tools and they're worried
about being sued.
And we are all old.
We're all living longer.
We retired to Florida.
It is awesome.
And it is expensive.
So by the 1980s, health care costs are still growing like crazy.
And once again, we are wrestling with this question, how do we pay
doctors?
And the thing is that this actually should not be a very hard
question.
Competitive markets are generally really good at figuring out how
much people should be paid.
So for instance, David, say you want to hire a hoagie maker for
Kestenbaum's Hoagie Hotspot.
You do, right?
Yeah, yeah.
You're in search of a hoagie maker.
I am.
So you put a sign out front of your place and you say you're
hiring a hoagie maker.
And you say, OK, I'm going to pay you $6 an hour.
Actually, the sign says wanted sandwich artist.
Right.
OK, so you're paying $6 an hour.
And no one walks in to apply.
So what do you do?
You go out.
You change the sign.
OK, I'm going to pay you $6.50 an hour.
And then a couple of people come in and apply.
Still, nobody's got the right hoagie experience.
So you go out.
You change the sign again.
You say sandwich artist, $7 an hour.
And then you get lots and lots of qualified, great sandwich
artisans applying.
And you know that is the right price.
So for doctors, doctors, however, are different, as we talked
about a lot of times on this podcast.
They operate in an unusual market.
First of all, most of them are independent contractors.
Doctors generally like to work for themselves.
And we, we are their customers.
But we don't pay them directly.
We don't say, whoa, Dr. Kestenbaum, $50 for a physical
really, no way.
We don't say that because we have insurance.
So how, in the system we have, how do you figure out
how much to pay doctors?
The government could not figure it out.
Private insurers had a hard time figuring it out.
Sounds like a question for an economist.
So the question is, can we find a rational method that could
be used to set physicians' fees?
You know he's an economist when you hear the word
rational.
So this guy is Professor William Shau.
He's an economist at Harvard.
And in the 1980s, Professor Shau decided to do this kind
of crazy thing.
He said, OK, so the health care market has all these
distortions.
It doesn't set fees correctly for doctors.
So I will make up a market.
I will find the right prices.
And I will calculate exactly how much a properly
competitive market would pay you.
So this is kind of an odd idea.
It's like saying you could make a spreadsheet and somehow
figure out that the hoagie sandwich artist should get
$7 an hour.
But that is what he decided to do.
So he developed what is called a relative value scale.
Basically, he sat in this building at Harvard with
charts.
And he began to answer a lot of what really seemed like
philosophical questions, like what is a physician's
work?
How do you measure the mental work involved in
doing a colonoscopy?
How do you compare a pediatrician doing a baby
visit with a brain surgery doing brain surgery?
And Shau brought all these doctors into these panels
to figure it out.
So he would bring them in and they'd be advisors.
And he would have them each rate every single
thing that they did in relation to one reference
point.
So like, for example, a general surgeon would have a
reference of a hernia repair.
And so they'd talk about how hard that was compared
to every single other thing they did, how
technically hard it is, how stressful it is, how
much it costs, actual supplies.
And they would assign a certain number of units to
each procedure.
They did this for thousands and thousands of
procedures.
And Congress loved this idea.
The idea that someone, an economist from Harvard
no less, might be able to offer some rational way
of answering that annoying question, how do you pay
a doctor?
How much do we pay the doctors?
And so midway into Shau's research, Congress said,
if you can really do this, basically do what a
market normally would do in your little lab in
Harvard, we will adopt your scale and we will
completely change the way we pay doctors.
Which got doctors interested.
Very interested.
So interested that while Shau was conducting his
research, inviting groups of doctors into these
meetings to act as his advisors, those doctors
started bringing in their own advisors.
Most major specialties hire their own
consultants to watch over our work like a hog.
And they also try to second-guess us constantly.
Many specialty societies have their
consultants come with them.
Of course, we will not let their consultants
come into the same meeting.
So whenever there's a coffee break, all the
consultants will be waiting outside.
Really?
And these physicians who are serving as our
advisors will dash over to their consultants
trying to see how they can gain what we do.
So, David, they'd be in these little rooms and
then during the breaks all the docs would dash
out to talk to their consultants, which was
annoying to Shau, but he felt like the process
was strong enough to avoid too much bias from
those guys waiting outside.
But then all these specialty groups, the
orthopedists and the radiologists, they all
started coming out with their own relative
value studies.
American College of Orthopedic Surgeons took
our methods and commissioned a study to
outside consultants, produced the results
before we were finished.
So they did their own study ahead of your
study.
Yes, several of them did that, so did
radiology.
So then they were trying to trump us.
And so orthopedic surgeons present their
results.
They say the Shau study is not valid, and
then we had to explain why we think our
results are valid and more accurate compared
to theirs.
So it took a tremendous amount of work,
took years out of my life, and my hair turned
gray.
During that time?
Mm-hmm.
Step by step, ooh, baby.
Oh, Joey.
Okay.
We made it to 1992, and Shau has published his
research, and Medicare adopted the relative
value scale.
So doctors were no longer paid what they asked
for, but rather they were told what they would
be paid.
And one interesting consequence of that was,
according to the big spreadsheet, primary care
physicians turned out to be pretty valuable.
So they would make more than they did before,
and a lot of specialists would make less.
And overall, big headline of the day, health care
costs would stop growing so fast.
And yet, and yet, health care costs today,
they are still skyrocketing.
It's almost like time just stood still.
So Shau says this is not because his model was
flawed.
He says the relative values were right when he
created them, but every year they get
updated, and that process, he says, has been
taken over by special interests.
He says he put out his work, and Congress
basically handed it over to the guys who were
sitting outside his meeting rooms waiting for
the coffee breaks.
So, David, I actually talked to some of those
specialty groups that Shau feels like got
handed his research, the radiology and surgical
specialty groups, including this guy who
actually sits on the panel that updates the
relative value scale.
And he says health care is expensive.
It just is.
And who other than doctors are you going to
ask how hard it is to do a colonoscopy
and how that compares to a physical, to a
brain surgery?
You need doctors.
You need these specialty groups to be involved.
There is a lot of talk today about paying
doctors in a different way.
Instead of fee-for-service, just paying
them salaries.
The Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic, a
handful of well-regarded health care
organizations pay salaries.
But despite special appearances by President
Obama and the constant mention of these
places in the health care debate, no one is
actually really pushing this into law.
And so the question that we started with,
how do we pay doctors?
We still haven't really figured out how to
answer that question.
All right.
