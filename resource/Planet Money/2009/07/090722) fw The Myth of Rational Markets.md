The rational school of economics holds that markets make sense. Sure, some people and businesses trade on raw, crazy emotions, but the mistakes cancel each other out. In the end, the rational school argues, market prices make sense. And then there's real life. Anyone who has spent any time looking at the stock market has to think there's at least a decent chance the whole thing is crazy — prices pinging around, investors making crazy bets, regulators trying to figure out who's flouting the byzantine rules.

Sam Ley writes from KCFR land:

    Indicator: the average hourly rate people bill themselves for "hassle."

    Definition? So, my dad is a pretty handy guy, and has always been good at fixing cars, fixing stuff around the house, etc. However, sometimes he decided to do it, and sometimes he paid people to do it, and his explanation is that he sets an hourly rate that he "bills" himself for doing stuff that he describes as a "hassle," i.e., there is no fun factor to it. The rate changes based on how busy he is with work, how his personal savings are doing, etc.

    At the time he told me about it, when I was a teenager in the '90s, his hourly hassle rate was about $20/hr. If it would take him 5 hours to fix the water heater, including going to the hardware store, messing around with it, cleaning up, etc., but it would only cost $80 to pay someone to do it, he'd pay them, since it is "cheaper" than his $20/hr hassle rate.

    These days his mortgage is paid off (yes, he actually paid off a fixed rate mortgage last year), his hassle rate has gone up quite a bit, to more like $40/hr, reflecting his increased spending ability combined with a greater appreciation for spending time on fun things.

    I've always used the same system, modifying my rate on parameters such as finances, savings, time availability, enjoyment of certain types of tasks, etc., but it hovers around $30/hr for me.

    To get to my question, is this a common indicator? I know people unconsciously make decisions like this when deciding whether to fix something themselves, or pay someone to do it, but is it usually this explicit? Is it studied by anyone who tries to measure what people's internal hassle rate is, and how that changes over time, particularly during recessions? Are more people fixing their own toilets because all of a sudden their hassle rate has dropped to $10/hr, making it "cheaper" to mess with a dirty toilet than to pay someone else to fix it?

On the quick, Sam, I'd say that yes, people are fixing more things themselves.

I think your answer lies somewhere between transaction cost and opportunity cost.

Transaction costs are the expenses associated with carrying out an economic exchange — you can buy that refrigerator, but you've got to deal with carrying it home. Opportunity costs are what you lose when you pick one thing over another — you could fix that sink yourself, but then you couldn't also take a nap and go for a run.

As for how explicit people are about the dollar figures, my hunch is not very, but while I'm researching this, a bit of YouTube serendipity:

**faster whisper:**
We do expect to see positive job creation near the end of this year or early next year.
But it's going to take a while, given the pace of growth, for the unemployment rate
to come back down to levels that we would be more comfortable with.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg in New York.
And I'm Adam Davidson, also in New York, right across the table from me in this very
Today is Wednesday, July 22nd.
That was Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke you heard at the top.
Today on Planet Money, we take a look at an economic theory that informed the decisions
and behaviors of so many countless people in business and government for decades.
It is an economic theory so foundational that many people took it less as a theory
than as gospel truth.
Until the financial crisis got a lot of people questioning it.
We're talking, of course, about the efficient markets theory.
We'll get to that in a minute.
But first, Alex, I believe you have the Planet Money indicator.
I do. It is a ratio two to one.
That is the ratio of people moving out of the state of Michigan to those moving
into the state of Michigan, at least according to stats compiled by one company,
Allied Van Lines, covering the first six months of this year.
Right. So two people are moving out of Michigan for every one person moving in.
We learned about this from the Lansner on Real Estate blog, which is part
of the Orange County Register News Organization.
I just picture this long line of laid off autoworkers loading boxes into vans
and moving south or west or wherever.
That's happening in other states as well, North Dakota, Illinois, Indiana.
They all have high exodus rates.
Even California has more people leaving the state than coming into the state.
Only a little more, but still, California, that's the state where dreams are made,
the eighth largest economy in the world.
It's also a total financial basket case.
Right. So where are these people moving to?
Well, Washington, D.C. is a big destination, also up there, Oregon and Nevada.
Alex, you were just in Oregon on your vacation.
Would you move to Oregon?
In a heartbeat. It's beautiful.
Well, I sort of like it here, actually.
Yeah, New York's pretty beautiful, too, in its own way.
In a very different way, but still.
So, Adam, today we're talking to Justin Fox.
He is the author of a new book called The Myth of the Rational Market.
Now, this is a fairly provocative title.
Right, because it's asserting that the theory that has been taught forever
in economics classes and business schools,
the theory that markets are rational is a myth.
I mean, that's what he says in the title, The Myth of the Rational Market.
Right. And so before we get to our talk with him,
let's just go over what this theory is.
Most broadly, it's associated with the Rational School of Economics,
which is headquartered at the University of Chicago, my alma mater,
although I did not study economics there.
My main teacher was a communist, but never mind.
That's a separate discussion.
But look, anybody who has spent any time looking at, you know,
the stock market or any other financial market,
they have to think that there is a decent chance
that the whole thing is absolutely crazy.
Right. Prices hurtle up and down, changing by huge numbers in a few hours,
seemingly on a whim.
But the Rational School of Economics says, no, that's not right.
It's not crazy.
Maybe some people are trading in some raw, random, emotional way.
But overall, financial markets always and forever
reflect the best knowledge that exists in all the world.
If some number of investors are irrationally pessimistic,
then there's some other group of investors who are irrationally optimistic.
And so they basically cancel each other out.
The actual market price, all those people making their crazy decisions,
what it eventually arrives at is a logical price, rational.
It changes rapidly because information about the world changes rapidly.
At least that is the theory that a lot of people have had for a long time.
Right. Now, this theory has many parts to it, many ramifications.
One offshoot called the Efficient Markets Hypothesis
has specific consequences for anyone with any money in the stock market.
Investors like me with my sadly modest retirement account,
which brings us to our conversation with Justin Fox,
who wrote the myth of the rational market.
He says that this efficient market hypothesis came into
the popular consciousness in the late 70s.
A guy named Jack Bogle popularized it.
And this hypothesis, says Justin Fox,
meant something very specific to the average investor, to someone like me.
From the investing perspective, that meant you can't beat the market
because of something you read in the Wall Street Journal this morning, or
because you've been studying your stock charts and in the past,
a head and shoulders led to whatever happening next.
I feel like the rational school has been such a beautiful, comforting
lifeline, comfort blanket, teddy bear.
I don't know what to call it.
It has been so good to my mental health and well-being
that I really, really, really do not want anyone, including you,
Justin Fox, to convince me it isn't at least true enough to comfort me.
And so wait, why has it been so comforting to you?
So basically- It's like a blankie.
But it's a wonderful blankie.
So here's the thing.
You know, I've been a business reporter for a long time.
I'm as befuddled as anyone by what stocks to buy,
what investments to make.
And people ask me, oh, what should I invest in?
I have absolutely no idea.
I don't even know how you would do it.
I know 100 different ways you could do it.
I just don't know which one I would recommend.
And I find it all overwhelming.
It makes me nervous.
It makes my heart pound.
It makes me feel guilty and scared.
And then I was given the gift of the efficient market
hypothesis, which tells me that there is nothing I could do that
would make a difference, that I do not have the tools, the time,
the knowledge, or the wealth to beat the market.
I'm just going to, best case scenario, make what the market makes.
And the most sophisticated, the most Nobel Prize endorsed investment
strategy happens to be the easiest and the laziest, which
is I find a few low cost index funds.
I give all my money to them, all my retirement income to them.
But that's it.
I don't have to ever, ever, ever read an earnings report
or go to Yahoo Finance or read the journal for anything
other than journalistic reasons.
But you can still do that without believing that the market
is perfectly efficient.
And that's Jack Bogle, who's one of my favorite characters
in my book.
He is the comfy blankie of all comfy blankies.
But what Jack likes to say is that you don't
have to believe in the efficient market hypothesis.
You just have to believe in the cost matters hypothesis.
And the best way to think of that
is the average investor is going to do as well as the market,
just on average.
Just by definition, the average investor
gets the same return as the market minus any costs,
trading costs, what you pay your mutual fund manager
or your favorite hedge fund manager or whatever.
So the time that you spend pouring through the pink sheet
stocks and whatever.
So if you don't have a really great reason
to believe you're either above average as an investor
yourself or you know how to pick people who
are well above average.
And I would say that describes 95%, 98%, 99% of us.
Then the one thing you should just focus on
is keeping the cost down as low as possible.
Because then you're increasing your chance
of being at least average.
Because most investors end up being below average.
Because the average investor earns the market
minus costs and then everybody's got all these costs.
Well, that's a relief at least, right?
Yeah, my best investment strategy
is to keep being lazy.
Excellent.
But the efficient market hypothesis
has much, much farther reaching effects
than just personal investing.
Right, one of the greatest outgrowths
of the rational school and the efficient markets hypothesis
has to do with people's attitudes about prices.
If you believe, as efficient markets hypothesis teaches,
that at any given point the price of something
is the reflection of all known information
about that something, then a price can't be wrong.
It may seem insane, for example,
that a bottle filled with fermented grape juice
could be worth tens of thousands of dollars.
But the price is rational because that's the price
that people will pay for it.
That's the price that the market will bear.
And this way of thinking that markets
know what they're doing,
that markets have a rational price
has pervaded both government and finance
for most of the last three decades.
If you go before, say, 1980,
Jimmy Carter, but it's the same for Republicans
like Richard Nixon, basically,
almost pretty much all presidents since FDR
believed that markets were not inherently rational,
that markets did not move towards
the best thing for society.
They needed government help.
So take the airlines or take trucking.
These presidents felt that if you left those companies
to their own devices,
they would not serve customers in the right way.
The prices wouldn't be right.
So they needed to be heavily regulated.
The government had to say where planes could fly,
where trucks could go, how many could go,
what the prices they could charge would be.
Ronald Reagan famously disagreed.
He deregulated the airline industry
and the trucking industry.
And pretty soon we're flying more than ever.
It's cheaper than ever.
We go to more places than ever.
I believe it's safer than ever,
although I know for sure it is not more comfortable
and enjoyable than ever.
There's less legroom than ever.
There's less legroom than ever, but all right.
And trucking, similarly, we ship goods much more cheaply.
We have FedEx, UPS, all of that stuff.
Right, so these are the success stories
of the efficient market hypothesis.
We deregulated these industries.
Basically, it's gotten cheaper and more efficient.
Same with phone companies, for example.
These were also deregulated in the mid-80s.
That also brought about lower prices,
a lot more phoning options, the cell phone revolution.
It's hard to say that that could have happened
if we hadn't deregulated the phone company.
So the idea through all these decades in presidents,
starting with President Reagan
and continuing through both Presidents Bush's,
President Clinton, and even the guy right now,
President Obama, they generally believe
it's better to let the market find the price
and get government out of the equation.
The market price is better, is more rational.
Of course, if you look at, say,
the market price of housing or of tech stocks
over the last decade, it's pretty hard to argue
that they have always and forever been
the rational, efficient price
reflecting all known information at the time.
I mean, basically, planet money owes its existence
to the fact that that may not be true.
We have studied a lot of the irrationalities
that we've noticed.
So we asked Justin Fox,
does the collapse of the tech stock bubble
at the early part of the decade,
the much more recent and more dramatic collapse
of the housing bubble,
will this permanently silence those
who've been advocating the rational markets theory?
It will put them into hibernation, I feel like.
I mean, we accept that they do have useful things
to say about matters other than housing bubbles.
And I mean, there are two counterattacks I've heard.
One is that, okay, there was a bubble,
but if you look at the actions of individuals,
they were mostly rational, at least over the short run.
And that's fine with me.
My issue isn't whether individuals
are being rational or not.
It's whether market prices are these reliable gauges
of the worth of things.
And it's pretty clear that the market prices for houses
a couple of years ago were not a very good gauge
of the worth of those houses.
So that's one argument is that individual behavior
is rational, but market's not.
Okay, I buy that.
The other one is you'll hear all the people saying,
well, if only government hadn't been so involved.
And I mean, clearly there were,
the whole Washington push towards home ownership
was a factor in what happened to mortgage markets.
And maybe more crucially,
Greenspan lowering interest rates
and keeping them low for an extended period of time.
But at the same time, you had these bubbles and crashes
as long as there've been financial markets,
but before there were central banks
or significant financial regulation
or even significant government role
in the economy of any kind.
And so it seems like there's something,
I mean, first of all, are markets really that fragile
that they can't see that, okay, Fannie and Freddie,
there's distortion, let's price around that distortion.
You'd think if markets were perfectly rational,
they could handle that.
So I find that, I mean, John Taylor
has this whole argument that none of this bad stuff
wouldn't have happened if Hank Paulson
hadn't scared everybody in mid-September.
And I just, nobody,
you talk to any actual market participants
and none of them buy that at all.
And that doesn't mean they're right,
but I find that a pretty weak argument.
How much of it do you think
is that the efficient market theory was so pervasive
that it actually reinforced itself?
In other words, somebody who without
the efficient market theory would have said,
this looks like a bubble price,
could now say to themselves,
well, it can't be a bubble price
because of the efficient markets.
And so they continued in this,
it actually helped fuel the bubble.
I think in housing market,
you can totally see that in papers
that would be published by the Fed
and written by other academic economists.
Because you basically had Bob Schiller out there,
and he's this very major figure in my book
who sort of started his assault
on the rational efficient market theory
in the late 70s or at least 80s
and has continued with it ever since.
You had Schiller saying,
this doesn't prove anything,
but I put together this chart of real estate prices
going back to 1880 or whatever.
And we've never had a rise
like we've had over the past 10 years.
And also over the long run,
there've been long periods
where inflation adjusted real estate prices
dropped for decades on end.
So something bad's probably gonna happen.
I can't tell you when,
but it's probably gonna happen.
So then you read all these papers
by more conventional academics,
and it was always,
just saying the prices have gone up a lot
doesn't prove anything.
Markets do what they do for a reason.
Why house prices have risen so much.
And they would always be able
to find explanations for why.
But there was, and I really do think
that the whole idea of the efficient market
and the rational market was a big factor in that
that it just made people afraid to say,
the housing emperor has no clothes.
So this widespread belief in efficient markets
actually made them less efficient.
Yeah, and the other with Alan Greenspan,
and Greenspan was this way too,
where he sort of saw every indication
that something was going crazy.
And he'd give these speeches or do these papers
and always sort of come around in the end.
But we have these great markets
for sharing and distributing risk.
I think it'll all work out in the end.
So we here at Planet Money,
we're not taking sides in the rational market
versus non-rational market debate.
But I think we do celebrate the idea
that whatever core assumptions
underlay economic thinking from all sorts of perspectives
should now after this crisis,
maybe take a new look at them.
Right, and I would like to propose a hypothesis
that could maybe replace the efficient market hypothesis.
I call it the Alex Bloomberg hypothesis.
And it's just, I determine the price for everything.
That is totally irrational.
Check it out, listen.
Helicopters, $5.
Pleated pants, $1,500.
Puppies, free.
You're an idiot.
It's just a theory.
All right, that is it for today, thank goodness.
It is also the last time we get to remind you to vote
in the great Planet Money Top Chef Iron Runway
Project Model Challenge.
Who are you voting for, Adam?
Oh man, I'm losing.
You know that.
I didn't want to say anything.
Yes, you did.
Anyway, you can check it all out at mpr.org slash money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
The fast enough and hold tight.
We can't give up without a fight.
And we're going back and forth and back and forth
and back and forth and back.
We're going back and forth and back and forth
