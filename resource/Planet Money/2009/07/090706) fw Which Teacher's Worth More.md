Should good teachers make more than bad ones? The Obama administration says the nation needs to start rewarding merit, and economist Michael Podgursky of the University of Missouri agrees. It's just that there's no simple means of carrying that out. Plus: A listener has an economic riddle. If colleges compete for students by making it easier to get degrees, then employers can't necessarily tell who's better qualified. What would an economist call this problem and how can it be fixed? Robert Frank, author of the Economic Naturalist's Field Guide, has an answer.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THIS WEEK")

VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We and everyone else misread the economy. The figures we worked off of in January were the consensus figures and most of the blue-chip indexes out there.

GIRL TALK: (Vocalizing, singing) All we need is a drummer...

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

Hi, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Laura Conaway in New York City.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt back in beautiful Seattle. It is Monday, July 6. And you just heard Vice President Joe Biden speaking on ABC's "This Week" at the top. Today, listeners, you, Laura, me, Chana, we are going to get schooled.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ABC")

THE JACKSON 5: (Vocalizing).

CONAWAY: Yeah. As the kids say, we are going to drop some knowledge on you. We're going to tell you why your kids' teacher perhaps needs some more school.

JOFFE-WALT: And maybe some more money. All that, but not before we deliver that PLANET MONEY indicator. It is 33.

CONAWAY: That's the average number of hours people are working right now in the United States each week. It comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's a little short of that 40-hour week we like to talk about. This number comes from the BLS' latest employment report or unemployment report.

JOFFE-WALT: And that 33 hours a week - this is crazy to me - it's the lowest it has ever been. The BLS began tracking weekly hours in 1964. And this right here - we are at rock bottom so far.

CONAWAY: And folks, we say this a lot, that you folks out there are living this recession. It really is your recession. And you've been writing to us on the blog and telling us on the podcast for months now about your hours being cut. You're talking to us about furloughs and going part-time. And sometimes you folks out there are ahead of the statisticians.

I talked to economist Howard Rosen about this just this morning. And he says, yes, absolutely. The PLANET MONEY crowd saw this coming.

HOWARD ROSEN: You were the first one to document, you know, job sharing and furloughs and there it is. It's now being represented in the numbers. It's a change not just in terms of the number, but it's also a change in terms of the nature of our work. You know, people were working overtime and all that kind of thing, and now they're not. And, you know, for a lot of people, that's how they make ends meet, is through their overtime.

JOFFE-WALT: I love that the PLANET MONEY people beat the statisticians. That's awesome.

CONAWAY: Isn't that cool?

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So maybe one day, you all can help us document some bright side of life instead of all this bad news all the time when we get a real recovery.

CONAWAY: And meanwhile, let's all try to remember that economics also has its fun side. And one of the fun things for us about economics is that it can really help you unlock the puzzles of ordinary life.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. I've been thinking about this a lot, actually, learning more and more about economics. There's all these, you know, small day-to-day questions that economics offers some insight to, like why is there a light in the refrigerator but not a light in the freezer?

CONAWAY: Yeah. And what has that got to do with my diet? That's what I want to know.

That question appears in economist Robert Frank's book, "The Economic Naturalist." He talks a lot about mysteries like that. He runs a whole class in Cornell where they basically try to take apart everyday mysteries. I asked Robert Frank if he'd help us with a riddle sent in by a listener. The listener lives in Israel and works for a college that trains schoolteachers.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Here's the riddle. You ready?

CONAWAY: Yep.

JOFFE-WALT: The colleges - they train teachers, and their tuition is set by the government. So the listener says the colleges - they have to compete for students, but they can't do it by offering lower tuition. So the way that they make a better deal for students is that they lower the standards.

CONAWAY: Which is to say they make the classes easier. They assign fewer papers. They assign fewer hours of student teaching, which is where the novice has to go in and try to run the class. I always used to love that day in school. And the end result can be that you get teachers who aren't as well-trained as they should be because they got this sort of bargain education. The listener in Israel wanted to know what an economist would call this problem and how it could be solved. Here's Robert Frank.

ROBERT FRANK: Well, I guess most generally, it's a problem of imperfect information and, more particularly, asymmetric information. So the people who are hiring teachers know less about how they were trained than the people who train them.

CONAWAY: So, Chana, if an elementary school knew that its new kindergarten teacher came from a college that had cut corners, then maybe the hiring committee would pick another candidate.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, but the way that the system works right now is that the hiring committee, they can't necessarily know who got good training and who didn't. It's not, you know, written on their resume or something. So one way to solve that problem of asymmetric information would be to figure out just how well the teachers do in real classrooms. Put them in a real classroom; see how they do. But setting up an objective criteria for that - Robert Frank says it's not that easy.

FRANK: Can we actually say who's an effective teacher and who isn't? I mean, everybody has intuition about that. But I don't know if we have really reliable instruments that can measure that on a mass scale.

CONAWAY: 'Cause maybe they would do well on a licensing test or something like that, but it doesn't make them a good classroom teacher.

FRANK: That's right. Yeah, the problem is when you give tests to assess how well programs are doing, then people spend all their time and energy preparing for the tests, which, if they measured exactly what you cared about, would be fine. But often the thing you're measuring is only vaguely related to the thing you really care about.

CONAWAY: It seems like this is the kind of thing that, in a long picture view, the market might have a chance of working out if teachers are rewarded according to their proficiency in the classroom. And they might look around and say, oh, the students from here did better. And then that school would start to get a reputation as the place to go.

FRANK: That's right. So if some programs really are better than others, and if you can tell who's good and who's bad once people are on the ground doing the job, then I think the market can sort this out. You know, those are two big ifs. Oftentimes, each one of those steps is difficult.

CONAWAY: It sounds like there's a high level of they're just going to have to lump it in this one.

FRANK: (Laughter) You know, I think there's a clear tendency for people to compete on the easy dimensions. I know we see it in MBA instruction. You know, the MBA ratings that services like Business Week bestow on programs depend to an enormous extent on how happy the students are in the programs. They survey the students and get them to rate their own programs, if you can imagine. And so there's an enormous premium nowadays among MBA programs to make sure the students are happy. And it's not exactly the same thing, to make sure a student is happy and to make sure a student is well trained. Sometimes the things you need to do in order to get well trained don't make you happier.

CONAWAY: And, Chana, let's just look at how happy all those MBAs made the economy, you know?

JOFFE-WALT: Ooh (laughter).

CONAWAY: Just saying.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So - but here's the thing, Laura. So you and Frank are saying it's hard to figure out who's a good teacher. It's just a hard thing to measure. But I'm going to take you to task there. So our new education secretary, Arne Duncan, just the other day, he was telling 10,000 teachers in San Diego that we need to do exactly that. This was the National Education Association conference. And he said to all these teachers, we need to figure out a way to pay you for being good teachers and to pay you less for being bad teachers.

CONAWAY: Ooh. Sounds like picking a fight.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. So this is a really contentious issue within education. And it's also really interesting because it gets at this bigger question that, you know, we at PLANET MONEY are wanting to look into a lot more, is just compensation in general - what determines what I get paid and you get paid and your mom gets paid.

CONAWAY: Lay off my mom, Chana. You know, my mom actually is a schoolteacher in a poor state, you know? So she's...

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, really?

CONAWAY: Yeah. She's not making that much. She teaches public school in Mississippi.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So let's talk about how your mom does get paid right now. So, you know, because we value schools and public education, we think every child should have access to them, so we need a bunch of teachers, and we need to pay them. And we - the way that we do it now is we look at teachers, and we say, you all do the same job. Every single one of you is going to be put on this pay scale, this salary schedule. And it's a graph. It's got rows, and there are rows for experience and for degrees. I talked this through with an economist, Michael Podgursky at the University of Missouri. And he told me almost every public schoolteacher in the country gets paid by these two metrics - experience and degrees.

MICHAEL PODGURSKY: So everyone is marching along that same salary schedule, whether they're a first-grade teacher or a high school chemistry teacher and, you know, whether they're in a low-performing school that's, you know, tough or a really nice school or whether they're a really good teacher, very effective, or less effective.

JOFFE-WALT: So if I'm a teacher and I want to increase my pay, I need to either get more training, or I need to just wait out 30 years until I can start making more and more the longer I'm there.

PODGURSKY: That's right. If you want to make more money, you either get older, or you get more degrees. Or you become an administrator. But you're not going to make more money staying in the classroom.

JOFFE-WALT: So, Laura, you may be able to sense in his voice, this is a system that makes Podgursky and many, many other economists crazy. He gets so riled up talking about it that he even uses a bad word - sort of. Well, he thinks it's a bad word.

PODGURSKY: I think most economists who look at and sit down and think about it and look at the single salary schedule would say, boy, this is really inefficient (laughter). You know, that's the strongest thing an economist can say - this is really inefficient.

CONAWAY: Caitlin Kenney out there directing our podcast, I think we need to go back and bleep the word inefficient.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter) I know. He says it like it's going to really drop a bomb - inefficiency in the public school system. So he - you know, and he is looking at this as an economist. And he looks at the typical problems that most schools face, problems, you know, like good teachers often leave the profession early, earlier than we would like them to. And some not-so-good teachers, they stick around a little bit too long. And some schools are more difficult than others, so it's hard to get people to work in those schools and to stay. And it's hard to find science and math teachers and special ed teachers. And by paying everyone the same, Podgursky says you're not recognizing these facts; you're ignoring that all of these things are realities.

So Podgursky works at a university, right? So he would say it makes no sense for the university president to say, OK, you're all professors; you're all going to get paid the same.

PODGURSKY: These finance professors make more than the economics professors on average. And the economics professors make more than the history professors. So that's what we mean by market based. So if the history department wants to go out and hire a historian and a new, say, young Ph.D., they'll pay the market rate. You know, if an economist in my department - I was chair for 10 years - if someone got an offer from another university and we want to keep that person, we'd match it. Most organizations would if you want to keep them.

See - schools don't do this. We sort of look at a school district and say, well, they're all teachers. But the reality is the training that goes into, you know, a chemistry teacher is very different than the training that goes into an elementary school teacher. And their working conditions are very different. But most important of all, on average, their nonteaching opportunities differ.

CONAWAY: So what Podgursky's talking about here, Chana, is that the chemistry teacher could also work as a lab tech or maybe work in biotech or pharmaceuticals or something like that and maybe get paid a lot more. So you want to encourage that person to stay put in the schools instead.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And what ends up happening is that it's really hard to find a high school science teacher, so you end up with someone who's underqualified, who maybe didn't major in chemistry or doesn't have the right license to teach that subject, or, you know, you'll end up with a teacher certified in biology teaching a calculus class. And, you know, of course, the students all suffer from that.

CONAWAY: Yeah. In my school, Chana, we had football coaches who would teach science. And I don't mean to say, football coaches of the world, before you write in, that that is necessarily a bad thing because maybe some of you learned a lot of science or majored in science or got master's degrees in science while you were also learning to be football coaches. But in our case, it really seemed like the guy had read the textbook the night before and came in and told us what was in it.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And if you go to, you know, a lousy school and the teachers are leaving all the time, or if you love calculus and the school doesn't have a good teacher and instead, you know, a not-so-great teacher who's been there for years and years and years, you know, won't leave, these are obviously problems.

CONAWAY: Yeah. I mean, clearly, they're problems. But let's say we are going to pay chemistry teachers more, and let's say we are going to pay teachers based on performance through - effective teachers get more. How in the Sam Hill are we actually going to determine effective teaching? I mean, that gets to be kind of a difficult, sticky question. And I'll tell you, I mean, my mom is living this all the time. It's like, she works in a school district where nobody's test scores look particularly good. So it isn't like you can say, oh, this many of her students are coming up to literacy. They're not. And yet that's how schools right now are measured, really, is through test scores.

JOFFE-WALT: That's always where the debate ends up focusing around is how are you going to measure which teachers are good and which teachers aren't good, and is it going to be based on how their students do, how their students perform on tests or grades or something like that? And teachers unions really hate that idea. They say, you know, you don't really want students sitting down at a test and determining how much their teachers get paid.

CONAWAY: And Podgursky says just forget them?

JOFFE-WALT: No. I mean, Podgursky doesn't really care how exactly this happens in individual districts, just that they do think about the way that they're going to pay their teachers and that it does have something to do with their performance. So he says, you know, you can design a bad compensation system, and basing, you know, pay only on test scores, that could be bad.

PODGURSKY: A reasonable package, it seems to me, would include classroom evaluations, supervisor evaluations, you know, potentially evaluations of peers, data on student performance, student attendance. So all of these could play a role. Schools will have to experiment. But, you know, this gets done, you know, in lots of other environments. You have evaluation systems that have multiple components in them. That's the way most of the rest of the world works. I'm sure it even happens at NPR.

JOFFE-WALT: Laura, you got a big secret bonus last year, didn't you?

CONAWAY: Yes, it was really big and not so secret now.

JOFFE-WALT: I mean, this is the thing is, actually, you know, this isn't really how NPR works. NPR is a lot more like public school teachers rather than getting paid for performance. And actually, I talked to these two other economists this morning who wrote a paper about merit pay, and basically, they say this idea that this is how the rest of the world works, well, you know, pay for performance does happen in the private sector a lot and in nonprofits, too, but it's not as often as people who love merit pay for teachers would like to believe. You get people who get commission - so, like, real estate and sales and people in the financial sector. Sure, they often get paid for performance directly tied to something that they're doing. But a lot of workplaces don't do that.

So you know, of course, this, Laura, has now made me really interested in spending more time figuring out, you know, how other places determine how to pay their people.

CONAWAY: Yeah. This is a thing that we want to keep on, this question of how should people get paid. I mean, we see bank presidents getting so many millions and people who work just as hard at a far-distant pole of the economy making a lot less. And we want to know from you, first of all, how does compensation work at your workplace? And also, if you could just imagine for us that you are the boss of your workplace, how would you choose to pay everyone? What kinds of incentives would you have in place to keep everyone coming to work and happy? But be realistic, folks. You have limited resources. You've got to keep the place running.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. But sort of you get to fantasize. If you're the boss, like, if you work at a restaurant, you have servers, and you have a host and a manager and chefs and line cooks. And, you know, how would you, as the boss, decide how to divide up the pay? Should it be exactly even? Or, you know, maybe it should change every pay period based on your subjective assessment of everyone's performance, or, you know, maybe you'll just pay people based on your experience and how much in tips you bring in.

CONAWAY: Which would make the line cooks pretty sad.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So, you know, I actually like this idea that you get all the employees together. Like, what if we got everyone on the PLANET MONEY team together and we all just anonymously wrote down what we think everyone else should get paid and then just determine it that way?

CONAWAY: (Laughter) Yeah, Chana, let's do that. I think that we have to somehow get along well enough to get out of the rest of this week. That's what I'm saying. But you...

JOFFE-WALT: I'll get you good pay, Laura. You get me; I get you?

CONAWAY: Ooh, a secondary market. I like it, Chana.

OK, folks out there. Tell us - what's your dream of the best way to run your office with money? Planetmoney@npr.org. Send it to us. Write it up - planetmoney@npr.org. And we'll be back at this soon.

JOFFE-WALT: All right. There we are. And we will also link to Robert Frank's new book, "The Economic Naturalist's Field Guide." It'll be on our blog, npr.org/money. We'd love to hear your economic riddles.

I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

CONAWAY: And I'm Laura Conaway. Thanks so much for listening.

Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money, I'm Laura Conaway in New York City
And I'm Chana Jaffee-Walt back in beautiful Seattle. It is Monday, July 6th
And you just heard Vice President Joe Biden speaking on ABC's This Week at the Top
Today listeners, you, Laura, me, Chana, we are going to get schooled
Yes, the kids say we are going to drop some knowledge on you
We're going to tell you why your kid's teacher perhaps needs some more school
And maybe some more money. All that but not before we deliver that Planet Money indicator. It is
33. That's the average number of hours people are working right now in the United States each week
It comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's a little short of that 40-hour week
We like to talk about
This number comes from the BLS's latest employment report or unemployment report and that 33 hours a week
This was crazy to me. It's the lowest it has ever been. The BLS began tracking weekly hours in
1964 and this right here we are at rock bottom so far
And folks, we say this a lot that you folks out there are living this recession
It really is your recession
And you've been writing to us on the blog and telling us on the podcast for months now about your hours being cut
You're talking to us about furloughs and going part-time and sometimes you folks out there are ahead of the statisticians
I talked to economist Howard Rosen about this just this morning and he says yes
Absolutely, the Planet Money crowd saw this coming. You were the first one to document
You know job sharing in furloughs and there it is. It's now being represented in the numbers
It's a change not just in terms of the number but it's also a change in terms of the nature of our work
You know people were working over time and all that kind of thing and now they're not and
You know for a lot of people that's how they make ends meet is through their overtime
I love that the Planet Money people beat the statisticians. That's awesome. Is that cool?
Okay, so maybe one day you all can help us document some bright side of life instead of all
This bad news all the time when we get a real recovery
And meanwhile, let's all try to remember that economics also has its fun side
And one of the fun things for us about economics is that it can really help you unlock the puzzles of ordinary life
Yeah, I've been thinking about this a lot actually learning more and more about economics
There's all these, you know small day-to-day questions that economics offers some insight to like
Why is there a light in the refrigerator but not a light in the freezer?
Yeah, and what does that got to do with my diet?
That's what I want to know that question appears in economist Robert Frank's book the economic naturalist
He talks a lot about mysteries like that
He runs a whole class in Cornell where they basically try to take apart everyday mysteries

Sometimes the things you need to do in order to get well trained don't make you happier
And hannah, let's just look at how happy all those mbas made the economy, you know
Just saying
Okay, so but here's the thing laura. So you and frank are saying it's hard to figure out who's a good teacher
It's just a hard thing to measure
Um, but i'm going to take you to task there
So our new education secretary arnie duncan just the other day
He was telling 10 000 teachers in san diego that we need to do exactly that
This was the national education association conference and he said to all these teachers
We need to figure out a way to pay you for being good teachers
And to pay you less for being bad teachers. Oh sounds like picking a fight
Yeah, so this is a really contentious issue within education
And it's also really interesting because it gets at this bigger question that you know
We at planet money are wanting to look into a lot more is just compensation in general what
Determines what I get paid and you get paid and your mom gets paid off my mom hannah
You know my my mom actually is a school teacher in a poor state, you know
So she's not making it now. She's not making that much. She teaches public school in mississippi
Okay, so let's talk about how your mom does get paid right now. So
You know because we value schools and public education we think every child should have access to them
So we need a bunch of teachers and we need to pay them
And we the way that we do it now is we look at teachers and we say you all do the same job
Every single one of you is going to be put on this pay scale this salary
Schedule and it's a graph. It's got rows and there are rows for experience and for degrees
I took this through with an economist michael padgursky
At the university of missouri and he told me almost every public school teacher in the country gets paid by these two metrics
experience and degrees
So everyone is marching along that same salary schedule whether they're a first grade teacher
Or a high school chemistry teacher
And you know whether they're in a low performing school
That's you know tough or a really nice school
Or whether they're a really good teacher very effective or less effective
So if i'm a teacher and I want to increase my pay
I need to either get more training or I need to just wait out 30 years until I can
Start making more and more the longer i'm there
That's right. If you want to make more money you either get older or you get more
degrees
Or you become an administrator
But you're not going to make more money staying in the classroom
So larry you may be able to sense in his voice
This is a system that makes padgursky and many many other economists crazy. He gets
So riled up talking about it that he even uses a bad word
Sort of well, he thinks it's a bad word
I think most economists who look at and sit down and think about it
And look at the single salary schedule would would say boy
This is this is really inefficient
You know
That's the strongest thing an economist can say this is really inefficient
Caitlin kenney out there directing our podcast. I think we need to go back and and bleep the word inefficient
I know he says it like it's gonna really drop a bomb inefficiency in the public school system
So he you know, and he is looking at this as an economist and he looks at the typical problems that most schools face problems
You know like
Good teachers often leave the profession early earlier than we would like them to and some not so good teachers
They stick around a little bit too long
And some schools are more difficult than others
So it's hard to get people to work in those schools and to stay and it's hard to find science and math teachers
And special ed teachers and by paying everyone the same padgursky says you're not recognizing these facts
You're ignoring that all of these things are realities
So
Padgursky works at a university, right?
So he would say it makes no sense for the university president to say, okay, you're all professors. You're all going to get paid the same
these finance professors make more than the economics professors on average and the
Economics professors make more than the history professors
So that's what we mean by market base
So if if the history department wants to go out and hire a historian a new
Say young phd
They'll pay the market rate
You know if an economist
In my department I was chair for 10 years if someone got an offer from another university
And we want to keep that person would match it most organizations would if you want to keep them
See schools don't do this. We we sort of look at a school district and say well, they're all teachers
but the reality is the
The training that goes into you know, a chemistry teacher is very different than the training that goes into a
An elementary school teacher and their working conditions are very different
But most important of all on average their non
teaching opportunities differ
so what padgursky is talking about here hanna is that
The chemistry teacher could also work as a lab tech or maybe work in biotech or pharmaceuticals or something like that
And maybe get paid a lot more so you want to encourage that person to stay put in the schools instead
Right and what ends up happening is that it's really hard to find a high school science teacher
So you end up with someone who's under qualified who maybe didn't major in chemistry or doesn't have
The right license to teach that subject
Or you know, you'll end up with a teacher certified in biology teaching a calculus class and you know
Of course the students all suffer from that
Yeah in my school hanna we had football coaches who would teach science
And I don't mean to say football coaches of the world before you write in that that is necessarily a bad thing
Because maybe some of you learned a lot of science or majored in science or got master's degrees in science
While you were also learning to be football coaches
But in our case it really seemed like the the guy had read the textbook the night before and came in and told us
What was in it?
right, and if you go to you know a lousy school and the teachers are leaving all the time or if
You love calculus and the school doesn't have a good teacher and instead, you know
A not so great teacher who's been there for years and years and years, you know won't leave. These are obviously problems
Yeah, I mean clearly they're problems
But let's say we are going to pay chemistry teachers more and let's say we are going to pay teachers based on performance
Through effective teachers get more how in the sam hill are we actually going to determine effective teaching?
I mean that gets to be kind of a difficult sticky
Question and i'll tell you I mean my mom is living this all the time
It's like she works in a school district where nobody's test scores look particularly good
So it isn't like you can say oh this many of her students are coming up to literacy
They're not and yet that's how schools right now are measured really is through test scores
That's always where the debate ends up focusing around is is how are you going to measure which teachers are good?
And which teachers aren't good and is it going to be based on how their students do how their students perform
On tests or grades or something like that and teachers unions really hate that idea
They say, you know
You don't really want students sitting down at a test and determining how much their teachers get paid
And pagirski says just just forget them
No, I mean pagirski doesn't really care
How exactly this happens in individual districts just that they do think about
The way that they're going to pay their teachers and that it does have something to do with their performance
So he says, you know, you can design a bad compensation system and basing, you know pay only on test scores
That could be bad
A reasonable package it seems to me would include
classroom evaluations
Supervisor evaluations, you know
Potentially evaluations of peers data on student
performance
Student attendance so so all of these could play a role schools will have to experiment but but you know it
This gets done, you know in in lots of other environments you have
Evaluation systems that have multiple components in them
That's the way most of the rest of the world works
I'm sure it even happens at npr
Laura you got a big secret bonus last year, didn't you? Yes. It was really big and not so secret now
I mean, this is the thing is actually, you know
This isn't really how npr works npr is a lot more like public school teachers rather than getting paid for performance
And actually I talked to these two other economists this morning who wrote a paper about merit pay and basically
They said this idea that this is how the rest of the world works
Well, you know pay for performance does happen in the private sector a lot and in non-profits, too
But it's not as often as people who love merit pay for teachers would like to believe you get
People who get commission so like real estate and sales and people in the financial sector
Sure
They often get pay for performance directly tied to something that they're doing
But a lot of workplaces don't do that
So, you know, of course this laura has now made me really interested in spending more time figuring out, you know
How other places determine how to pay their people?
Yeah
This is a thing that we want to keep on this question of how should people get paid?
I mean we see bank presidents getting so many millions and people who work just as hard at a far
distant pole of the economy making a lot less
And we want to know from you. First of all, how does compensation work at your workplace?
And also if you could just imagine for us that you are the boss of your workplace
How would you choose to pay everyone?
What kinds of incentives would you have in place to keep everyone coming to work and happy?
But be realistic folks. You have limited resources. You've got to keep the place running
Yeah, but sort of get you get to fantasize if you're the boss
Like if you work at a restaurant you have servers and you have a host and a manager and chefs and line cooks
And you know, how would you as the boss decide how to divide up the pay should it be?
Exactly even or you know
Maybe it should change every pay period based on your subjective assessment of everyone's performance or you know
Maybe you'll just pay people based on your experience and how much in tips you bring in which would make the line cooks pretty sad
Right
So, you know
I actually like this idea that you get all the employees together
Like what if we got everyone in the planet money team together and we all just anonymously wrote down what we think
Everyone else should get paid and then just determine it that way. Yeah, let's do that
I think that we have to somehow get along well enough to get out of the rest of this week
That's what i'm saying. I'll get you good pay. Laura. You get me. I get you. Oh a secondary market
I like it hannah. Okay folks out there. Tell us what's your dream of the best way to run your office with money
Planet money at npr.org send it to us write it up planet money at npr.org and we'll be back at this soon
All right. There we are and we will also link to robert frank's new book the economic naturalist field guide
It'll be on our blog npr.org slash money. We'd love to hear your economic riddles
I'm hannah joffey walt and i'm laura conaway. Thanks so much for listening
