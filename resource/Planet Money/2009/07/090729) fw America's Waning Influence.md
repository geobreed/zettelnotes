Almost a year into the financial crisis, we ask foreign policy analyst Ian Bremmer to take stock of America's position in the world. Bremmer, author of The Fat Tail and president of the risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, says America has lost some of its power. Bremmer gives two reasons for that. First, he says, other countries have recovered from the crisis more quickly. The second, he says, is that the crisis has forced U.S. leaders to pay more attention to domestic affairs and play a less active role on the global stage. On the upside, Bremmer says this is a great time to invest in Iraq.

**faster whisper:**
The most important thing we achieved today was to agree on this broad framework for policies
and reform in both China and the United States to help lay the foundation for a more sustainable,
more balanced global recovery.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg. Today is Wednesday, July 29th. That was Treasury Secretary Timothy
Geithner, you heard at the top of the podcast, talking about China's economy, as everybody
knows, I'm sure. The first round of China, U.S. strategic and economic dialogue wrapped
up yesterday. And on today's podcast, we're going to be talking about how the role
of the United States in the global economy has changed. You have a nice conversation
about that, Adam.
Yeah. And I was on All Things Considered today talking about it too.
All right. But first, our Planet Money indicator. Today's indicator is .5 percent.
That was a very nice reading.
Thank you.
That is the percent by which housing prices increased. That is right. I said increased.
Housing prices increased.
They did. They increased in the three-month period ending in May.
According to the latest Standard & Poor's K. Schiller Housing Price Index, so
I guess that means it's over. The crisis is over.
Right. Because, you know, that index, the K. Schiller Standard & Poor's Index
is a widely used measure of national home prices. Robert Schiller, the guy who runs
that index, was one of the early warners of the housing bubble saying we had a
problem in the housing market long before other people noticed it.
So the fact that he, of all people, is saying, like, housing prices are up,
that could mean something.
But.
Yes, there's a but.
Yes. There's a big but. This number is surprising.
You said big but.
Yes. That's a family podcast. This number is surprising.
And maybe, possibly, it's the kind of thing that would signal that the housing
market has hit bottom and, you know, we're now going to just see housing
prices going up and up.
But it could be something else, couldn't it?
Right. A lot of people worry that this might just be a statistical blip.
The result of the foreclosure moratorium that a lot of the big banks
underwent in the spring.
See, a lot of big lenders agreed to stop initiating foreclosures this
spring as part of a voluntary effort to help shore up the housing market.
And because they were doing that, we didn't have as many foreclosed
properties flooding the market.
So there wasn't as much downward pressure on house prices from those
foreclosed properties.
But that moratorium is over.
So lots more foreclosures than there were.
Lots more forced selling of houses.
And as all these foreclosed houses hit the market, prices will, some
people think, go back to going down, sliding.
Right. And that might show up in future case-shiller price index data.
We'll see.
There's actually a great discussion on housing prices and what this
increase means on one of my favorite blogs.
As you know, Adam, the blog Calculated Risks.
I think that is your favorite blog.
You could just say not one of, but right.
I mean, you love that blog.
I love that blog.
I have a personal emotional relationship.
You really do.
I do. I do.
It's a good blog.
I like it. You love it.
I know. I know.
I would agree with you, but that would mean that my favorite blog in all
the world is about mortgage finance.
And I'm not sure I'm prepared to admit that.
And of course, your favorite blog in all the world is the
Planned Money blog.
Exactly.
At npr.org slash money.
All right.
So today we are going to start something that I've been wanting
to do for a long time and I hope will become a regular feature here,
maybe like every month.
As we have mentioned on this podcast, right kitty corner, we can
see outside our window Eurasia Group.
That's this very prominent political economy consultancy group.
Basically, it's a big floor full of smart people.
I know a lot of them who just spend all day figuring out what's going
on all over the world and how it affects global politics and economics.
And the guy runs it, Ian Bremmer, is a friend of ours.
And every Monday I get this email from him.
It's an elite little group of people, most of whom have to pay
a lot of money, but luckily, because I'm in the press, I get it
for free, explaining Ian's views on what's going on around the world.
And that makes me feel way smarter.
Right.
We've had Ian Bremmer on the podcast several times before and he's been great.
Right.
And so this time I wanted to do more like what he normally does,
which is go around the world and explain a bunch of key themes.
The key theme we talked about this week is how the US has changed.
So right now we're just about a year into this financial crisis.
We're coming on the anniversary of the acute days last September and October.
And for most of our life, we've been the unquestioned financial power
in the world, the US has been, and pretty much everyone in the world,
at least post-Soviet Union, post-Cold War, had a very strong incentive
to be friendly to us and listen to the US.
And the US tended to kind of go around the world and boss people
around and say, oh, we know how to run an economy.
You should do what we do.
And so I've been wondering a lot, like how is that over?
Has that changed?
So I asked Ian Bremmer, have we lost power?
Have we lost influence?
Are we less of a major superpower?
And Bremmer said, basically, yes, we are less for two reasons.
We are, first of all, because other countries have come out
of the recession much more quickly than the US.
And the Americans' ability to spend, spend, spend,
to be the driver of the global economy just isn't what it was.
And frankly, what it was probably wasn't what it was,
as we're finding out it wasn't a sustainable negative 2.5%
savings rate in the US a couple of years ago
is not something you can do at Infinitum.
But the second reason we don't have the same level of influence
is that we no longer are as focused on the foreign policy.
And the fact is we're just coming out of this strategic
and economic dialogue between the United States and China.
And Geithner, Secretary of Treasury,
is one of the top interlocutors.
He has 80,000 things on his plate before he gets to China.
Obama's top five priorities are all domestic.
And that, of course, also diminishes
the ability of the United States
to act as the world's superpower.
Early in the crisis, I interviewed a former Indian
finance minister, I think it was on our very first podcast
on Planet Money, and Yashwant Sinha,
if I remember correctly.
And he was just gleeful.
He was giggling, literally.
He was talking about how often US Treasury officials would
show up in India and just condescend
to the Indian financial minister,
just make him feel like a jerk for not knowing
how to run a modern economy.
And he's like, see, the Americans now learn.
Now they learn.
They're not so good.
That just coolness factor, what do we call it?
Reputation of infallibility.
Does that affect our ability to go around the world?
Or is it more about raw power?
I think that affects it less so.
I think that's very short term.
There's no question that there is a lot of brow beating
going on and a lot of chest thumping
going on in the emerging markets world.
The BRICS summit that we saw a couple of months ago,
Brazil, Russia, India, China, all saying,
this free market model led by the United States
and developed states, look what happened to the world
as a consequence of that.
Our models clearly are more relevant, more useful.
But of course, emerging markets are not so stable.
And they need the United States as a global driver.
So as gleeful as they want to be.
When people get too pessimistic about the US
and they say, will the US matter in five years?
I say, substitute United States
for the world's most important and largest economy.
And then ask me the same question.
Will the world's largest economy in five years matter?
Will people still pay attention to it?
And then the question seems a little bit silly.
And yet that question is actually being asked
by a bunch of folks today.
So we do need to take a little step back
from the silliness and the gleefulness that we hear.
So you are, so let me just get it,
cause you said two things
that could be seen as contradictory.
So on the one hand,
we are not as influential as we were a year ago
because of the financial crisis,
but we're still the most influential country
in the world.
And is this just a minor blip?
And assuming sometime in 2010,
we get back to sustained growth,
do we just go back to being as influential as we were?
Or have we permanently fallen down a notch?
Well, I think we need to recognize
that part of how we've fallen down
is our own willingness to take on that mantle.
There were a lot more people
that were prepared to accept the United States
as the world's policeman.
That is just not true today.
And I don't see that coming back
because of the difficulties
the American economy is experiencing.
So even though the United States
will be the most important power out there,
it won't get you as much.
What we will see will be on average,
reduced global economic gains, less efficiency,
and we will also see increasing absence
of leadership on key issues.
So before where the United States
was really driving through all sorts of decisions
on financial architecture and proliferation
and collective security and all of the rest,
increasingly, you will see
that those decisions just won't get made.
It's not that China is gonna suddenly step
into the saddle
and they're gonna create a new reserve currency,
there'll just be an absence of those things
and that will create much more market volatility.
So let's talk, we promised our listeners,
we go around the world a little.
When you talk about this vacuum
of international leadership,
I guess the biggest crisis in the world right now,
is it Iran?
Is that the biggest emerging crisis?
Well, if you wanna talk about both combination
of direct tensions and impact on the markets
on a global basis
and you wanna leave aside
what's happening in Washington,
that's probably your biggest, yeah.
So are we seeing already the US
taking a surprisingly quiet stand on Iran
or is this what we would have expected
even if we hadn't had the financial crisis
and lost power because it's a domestic election dispute?
The Obama administration's talked about engagement
and the domestic scene in Iran
is not moving in that direction at all.
There's also a lot of instability
at the highest levels in the Iranian government now,
even among the conservative mullahs.
And so as a consequence,
you have many on the sidelines
including Sarkozy in France,
including Netanyahu in Israel
meeting with a bunch of American policymakers this week
saying, you need to get diplomacy done fast or else.
So Obama said by September.
Wait, wait, wait, so Israel and France
are saying to the US, or will take action?
Well, or else.
I mean, France and Israel are pretty far apart.
Or else are less far apart
than you'd think with Sarkozy.
Historically, of course, they have been
with the French sort of indifference
or at least ambiguity towards NATO, but that's changing.
The point is what is the or else?
The Israelis are very assertively Barack
just the other day saying that-
Who'd Barack the Minister of Defense?
Defense and the coalition partner with Netanyahu
saying that he reserves very explicitly
the military option and-
Meaning bombing potential nuclear sites in Iran.
Well, they've never been explicit
about what the military option would be,
but one would think that bombing nuclear sites
would at least enter into the party.
No one in Israel really wants to do that.
No one knows what the or else is,
but we're moving towards the or else moment
and the Obama administration
doesn't really have a policy.
In fact, their special envoy for Iran, Dennis Ross,
actually was suddenly moved from special envoy status
the day after Iranian elections.
Never a good thing for an administration.
So let me see if I can place this narrative correctly
and I'm probably wrong here,
but what I'm hearing is the US had a financial crisis.
Our attention is much more domestic.
We're not caring so much about the rest of the world
because we're afraid our own way of life will collapse.
We've sort of disappeared from the world stage
and as a result, the Obama administration,
which only recently has a well-formulated response
to the financial crisis, to the number one priority
or number two priority,
does not have a well-formulated Middle East vision
or Iran vision.
Or China vision or North Korea vision.
I think that's right.
And as a result, places like Israel and France
that have more immediate concerns about Iran
are able to have more say, more influence potentially.
At least they feel confident enough
to kinda yell at the US and say,
this is what you gotta do.
I think that's true and I also think
that it's gonna be increasingly difficult
to coordinate responses because America's influence
is going to be constrained by its lack of attention.
Obama can only do so many things.
Look, he has a great amount of talent
on his foreign policy team, widely construed,
if you include intelligence and defense
and all that sort of thing.
And they're adults, but at the same time,
there is no Obama doctrine in the way
that there has been a Bush doctrine,
a Reagan doctrine, a Carter doctrine.
The Obama-
Whatever you think of those doctrines, they existed.
Like them, don't like them, they existed.
Obama's foreign policy approach is,
I'm gonna deal with it as a risk manager
and I'm gonna respond to crises as they pop up.
But when these things don't work,
when things break, and when a big decision
has to be made, what will Obama do?
We actually don't know.
We have no idea.
With Bush, we knew.
We probably didn't like it on many occasions,
but we knew.
And this is going to lead to a lot of adhocracy
on the part of some of our allies
and some of our more strategic competitors
around the world.
It's really interesting hearing him talk about that
because I don't, hearing that conversation,
I'm not sure what to think about it.
Is that better to have a president
like Ian Bremmer says President Obama is,
somebody who is just sort of like a pragmatic person
with a lot on his plate,
not really sort of forcing one doctrine in another,
or do we want somebody with a doctrine?
Like I'm not sure where I come down on that.
Does Ian Bremmer say that one is better than the other?
He didn't say that.
And I think, without getting too political or partisan,
I think it's safe to say there's not a huge amount
of appetite in the world for a US doctrine
that's assertively imposed in many ways.
I mean, President Bush is not popular around the world.
Let's just, or his foreign policy, I think at this point,
has very low ratings in the US.
And so I think there's a lot of comfort with the idea
that, okay, we're not gonna just have some policy
that is gonna be imposed no matter what.
But what Ian Bremmer did say that is lacking
is any ability to know, to predict,
again, for better or for worse,
you sort of had a good sense of how President Bush
would respond to a crisis.
With Obama, a lot of folks,
they just don't know how to think.
Is he gonna seek more of a friendly appeasement
with North Korea?
Is he gonna get tough with North Korea?
Is he gonna really eventually come down hard on Iran?
What's, I've been reading a lot about Israel.
They have no idea what he thinks about Israel.
There's a real suspicion of him there.
And so if there's, maybe you don't need a full-on doctrine,
but some predictability, some understanding
of here's how I'm, here are the tools I'm gonna use
or here's the basis, the ideological
or the intellectual basis I'm gonna use
to make decisions.
And Bremmer says the lack of that creates uncertainty,
which is dangerous.
I know, it's interesting though,
because Obama sort of built himself
as like sort of a pragmatist.
He's sort of trying to,
going back to the red states, blue states,
there's just purple states.
He's always been sort of saying like,
I'm gonna try to take the ideas of both camps
and try to be non-ideological.
That's at least how many people disagree
that he is that way,
but that's sort of how he presents himself.
And so it's sort of interesting to see that
represented in foreign policy
where people are used to thinking like,
we're gonna have somebody ideological sort of at the helm
who's gonna be making ideological decisions
that we can then sort of counter plan off of
or something.
Yes, yeah.
One thing he said that I found very interesting
is that for everything the US lost globally
and diplomatically because of the Iraq war,
Bremmer says that's nothing compared to what we lost
because of the financial crisis.
It's the entire Iraq experience is a tiny blip
compared to the global influence we have lost
because of this crisis,
which I found really interesting.
That is fascinating.
Now, speaking of Iraq,
you and Ian Bremmer talked about Iraq,
your favorite subject.
Yeah, in fact, you know,
there's a phrase I have said so many times
on this podcast that our wonderful producer,
Caitlin Kenney,
who never misses an opportunity to tease us,
has made an actual tape cut
so I don't have to waste my time saying it.
I can just point my finger at the engineer.
When I was in Iraq.
Right, I've heard that phrase before, it's true.
Hey, look, I've gotten a lot of flack from,
well, you guys and people on the blog.
Go spend a year in Iraq.
It is a formative experience.
It has changed who I am in a very fundamental way.
It changes how I think about economics, politics.
I fell in love with my wife there.
It has changed everything about my life.
I am not ashamed of the fact that I frequently say
when I was in Iraq.
Yes, you do frequently say it,
but I agree, I'm with you.
That's great.
The way I understand it,
the way I explain it to myself is I just think,
well, Adam feels the same way about his time in Iraq
that I feel about the housing blog calculated risk.
Exactly.
Yeah. Yeah.
Anyway, you and Ian Bremmer talked a lot
about Iraq, right?
Yeah, and here's something weird.
I actually, all right, so another confession.
I don't follow the day-to-day news about Iraq
as much as I once did.
And I hadn't really been following the business
and economics news in Iraq,
but Ian Bremmer said it's becoming,
Iraq is becoming a good news story.
He said that if you look at the electoral process,
it's moving towards a reasonably trustworthy
electoral process.
He said that the key issues in Iraq
are no longer will this country split apart
into three warring factions and create a world war
in which the Middle East and the rest of the world
go into all out chaos.
The key issues are kind of boring policy issues.
What's the best hydrocarbons law?
What should our trade relationship with Turkey be?
Kind of boring, typical country stuff
rather than this terrifying vision that I certainly had
that it's gonna break apart
and Turkey's gonna go to war with Iran
and Saudi Arabia and blah, blah, blah.
So now, no question Bremmer says,
the country is very, very far from being
some kind of ideal country.
A lot of my Iraqi friends keep calling me up
and telling me, oh my God, it is more corrupt than ever.
The government's incredibly corrupt.
But Bremmer says that it's becoming more
like an average kind of lousy country,
which is slightly better, yeah.
There are a lot of dangerous places in the world
that people invest.
I mean, Nigeria has been an interesting market
for all sorts of investors, not just oil.
I mean, consumer products and the rest,
infrastructure, telecommunications for a long time now.
Iraq is starting to become interesting for a lot of folks.
CEOs are traveling there.
Yes, they have flak jackets.
Yes, they have security, but they're going.
They're going to Baghdad, not even the north of Iraq.
That was inconceivable two years ago.
That's becoming a good news story.
Wow, that is really remarkable
that there's like, you got CEOs of companies
traveling to Iraq and trying to see
if there's a way to open up operations there,
start selling stuff to the Iraqi people.
Hey, Caitlin, can you play my favorite cut?
When I was in Iraq,
when I was in Iraq, it's something that I noticed.
I mean, there's all this attention played to oil,
but here's something else I noticed.
You know, there was very little trade
with much of the rest of the world.
Most of the consumer products that people had
were cheap Chinese knockoffs for the most part.
And I just kept noticing,
this is a country of 25 million people.
You know, the average income might not be that high,
but it's a country with tremendous wealth from oil.
And it's a country that has no brand loyalty.
There's no, they don't have a cell phone manufacturer
or a refrigerator manufacturer or a shampoo or whatever
that they're deeply loyal to.
And I would just think,
like if you're vice president of sales for Motorola
or Procter and Gamble or whatever,
how often does an entire wealthy country
of 25 million people suddenly appear on the world stage?
You know, it's available.
Like you can go in and sell and the Iraqi people,
they want consumer products, believe me.
So I've always thought like once this violence,
once this level of true chaos goes away,
it's gonna be a crazy free for all.
Right, and of course you said earlier though,
there's still a long way to go
before we get to this sort of vision
of sort of a trading partner
and less of, you know,
and not a foreign policy nightmare.
And Adam, you said you wanted to talk to Ian Bremmer again.
Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping to have him in,
I'd say like once a month,
let's go around the world, do a quick check-in.
I think his insights are very helpful
because he combines political and economic analysis
to help you understand how the world has changed,
what are the big stories,
but the good insight into the stories
that we are following.
And he's very helpful to me
in pointing out stories that I don't, you know,
I know more about Kazakhstan
as a result of Eurasia Group emails than anything else.
So let us know what you would like us to talk about,
the untold stories.
We're still gonna be covering the financial crisis,
but we do wanna expand Planet Money's area of focus
to include the rest of the world.
So please send us emails, planetmoneyatnpr.org,
or write to us on our blog, npr.org slash money,
or go to our Facebook page, write to us.
There are lots of ways to write to us.
Actually, I'm gonna give you Alex's home address right now.
You could write.
Yeah, and we're gonna have an excerpt
for one of those Monday morning notes from Ian Bremmer
on our blog, npr.org slash money.
So make sure you check it out.
And that does it for us today.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
