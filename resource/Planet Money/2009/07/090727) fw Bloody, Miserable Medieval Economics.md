Before governments had regulators with suits and briefcases, says College of William and Mary history professor Philip Daileader, they had knights. The Lancelots of real life went around the kingdom forcing people to pay whatever the knights decided they owed. It was a brutal economic approach. If you think the knights were tough, be thankful you never faced the guild system. It existed to eliminate competition and benefit producers at the expense of consumers. Craftspeople fought each other for control and tried to limit access to the market — at their own expense, it turned out.

On today's Planet Money:

Drag out those leggings and chain mail armor, folks. We're going medieval, specifically the 12th and 13th centuries.

Dean Flatt writes from New Jersey, who followed an 18-wheeler north on I-95 in Virginia:

    On the rear door of the trailer, along with a number of safety bulletins, was one prominent sign saying, "NOW HIRING Company paid training" and below these words should be a phone number, but instead were black markings redacting the numerals like text in a publicly released CIA document.

    I guess maybe next year when the jobless recovery is more fully underway, they'll put the contact number back up.

**faster whisper:**
My lords, my ladies, and everybody else here not sitting on a cushion, today, today, you
find yourselves equals.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money, I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg, today is Monday, July 27th.
On the show today, we're going to be talking about knights and guilds and Sir Lancelot,
but first, our Planet Money Indicator.
The indicator is, Alex, I honestly think this is the most exciting indicator we've ever
had in a Planet Money podcast.
All right.
And we've had some exciting indicators.
That's true.
All right.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
31.57.
I can't believe it.
31.57.
That is a huge relief.
It is a huge relief.
You sound a little disingenuous, but it really is.
This really is a big deal.
This is the TED spread.
Remember, Alex, back when we started the podcast, back in September and October, we were using
the TED spread.
Remember, it seems like yesterday.
Right.
The TED spread was tripping off our lips every single day.
And why is that?
Well, the TED spread is a way of measuring basically how freaked out the global economy
is.
Basically, it measures how much more it costs to borrow dollars from European banks
than it costs to borrow from the US government.
That sounds sort of complicated, but the bigger the number is, the more people are
worried that a bank might not be able to pay back the money that they've borrowed.
So in other words, the higher that number is, the more people are worried about this
health of banks, basically.
It measures how much big banks trust each other.
It's a way to just look at one number and know, boy, banks really don't trust
each other.
And we have certainly learned in the last few months that having big banks trusting
each other turns out to be like the bedrock, the basis of our entire global
economy.
Right.
Remember, October, the TED spread was way up above 400 basis points, or 4 percent.
And that's just a huge, huge number.
And now it's way down, way more than a tenth down to 31 basis points.
That means less than one third of a percent, nothing.
That tells us banks are beginning to really trust each other again.
Right.
Partly because banks are actually healthier, but also partly because governments
around the world have demonstrated that they're going to back up these big banks.
They're not going to let them fail.
Right.
And until this is, I don't know, what do you call it?
Like a clean number, a non-governmentally intervened number?
A TED spread without an asterisk next to it.
Right.
Exactly.
A non-steroid TED spread.
We are still in a financial crisis.
I mean, basically, we all know that if the Federal Reserve and other central
banks around the world pulled out some of their support of different banks, that
TED spread would hurdle upwards instantaneously.
But it does tell us that at least the government actions are having an effect.
Absolutely.
Right.
So today on the podcast, Adam, we're going to move back in time, long before there
was a number called the TED spread, long before there were international debt
markets, long before there was the concept of international, before there were banks,
before there was economics as a profession, but there were still economies.
Right.
And actually today's podcast comes out of one of my favorite things, which is, have
you ever listened to any of these teaching company lectures?
I think I should make very clear here because I'm about to sing their praises.
This is not a paid advertisement.
I have no formal, money has no formal relationship with the teaching company.
I don't know anyone there, although I think you have to just say this is an
unpaid advertisement because I'm going to talk about how awesome they are.
They're all these lectures where they get some really good professor to just give
a lecture on tape about some cool subject.
And the one I've been obsessed with lately is about the middle ages and listening to
it while walking around the city, riding the subway.
I heard a bunch of things that seemed like people on the Planet Money podcast
would find interesting.
I thought you, Alex, would find them interesting.
So I called the professor, his name's Philip Dayleader.
He's the chair of history at the College of William and Mary.
I asked him to go into a studio and talk to us about the economics of a village
in the middle ages.
He said, all right, let's go back to central France in the 12th and 13th century.
All right, sounds awesome.
Let's go.
All right, Alex, there is one condition for our journey.
OK, what is it?
I would like you to be a peasant.
I see.
Are you so insecure that in all of our radio dramas, you have to put me
in some sort of position of subservience to you?
Is that the way it is?
Yes, that is exactly the way it is.
I do feel better, by the way.
It does make me feel really good that you are weak and I am strong.
It's sad, but fine if it helps.
Go ahead, be the king.
No, no, no, not the king.
That's the interesting thing.
We're in the 12th and 13th century.
Kings are not as big a factor in most local economies.
Dayleader explains that life is very local,
and it's all about the local night.
The king is far away in Paris or something.
And you, the local peasant, you don't even think about the king.
You have probably never gone more than 10 or so miles
from the house you were born in.
And most of the stuff you produce, the agricultural stuff or other stuff,
much of it goes into the hands of others.
And not the greedy king or the central government.
Exactly, right, not them.
This is way before there's a nationwide royal taxation.
Philip Dayleader says that the main people collecting money
at this time, the main people collecting from the peasants,
people like you, the main people doing the collecting
were people like me, the knights.
Mostly you're paying it to local knights and local castellans,
individuals who own castles and who,
in return for theoretically protecting you,
have the right to levy exactions on you that resemble taxes,
although they're often levied arbitrarily.
You can pay random amounts of money at any time
that the local knight or castellan demands it.
And you have to pay, you have to pay that.
And often there'll be multiple knights in the neighborhood
who are levy these exactions on you,
filing you for various crimes that you've committed.
So the burden of payment is heavy,
but it goes to local strongmen rather than to a king
living far off Paris.
Now you grew up in New York, I know, like I did.
And it sounds an awful lot like those neighborhoods
in New York where the mob got a piece
of everybody's business.
Even Greenwich Village, where I grew up,
my understanding is just about every business had to pay.
It sounds more like that.
I mean, protection is really in quotes.
You're paying protection so that that person
doesn't kill you.
They're not protecting you from someone else.
That's exactly right.
We tend to think of medieval knights
in terms of chivalric behavior,
that they're supposed to be protectors of the weak.
The reason chivalric literature develops
is because knights were not protecting the weak.
They were extorting from the weak
and chivalric heroes like Lancelot
are held up as models for knights to emulate.
When the reality is that knights were thugs.
And because they are encased in armor
when they go out of their casso,
they're encased in stone
when they are within their casso,
so there's really nothing that a non-knight can do
to protect himself or herself against knights
when they come to a village
and ask you to hand over whatever you happen to
to possess at that time.
So it's a fairly brutal situation.
So you're a thug and I'm a poor, helpless peasant
who you're picking out all the time.
This is an easy radio drama to act in, I gotta say.
It feels like our life.
That's not fair.
No, it's not true.
You're giving the wrong impression.
I am.
All this thing that we hear about chivalrous knights
and all that sort of stuff, that's just all a big myth.
Yeah, it was specifically created.
It was like a medieval version
of the Stop the Violence campaign.
By the Trappist monk KRS one?
Yes.
Exactly.
All right, all right.
So this is part of the economy
of what is called the High Middle Ages,
the 12th, 13th century.
There's this thuggish knight
who kind of shows up every once in a while
and just steals your stuff arbitrarily.
He calls it a tax.
All right, just to steal basically, right?
Right, and that's not all.
The knight would also say to peasants like you,
hey, you gotta work for me.
You gotta do work on my land.
You gotta farm my land.
Maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks every year.
You have to just basically be an indentured servant.
Right, so you're making my life really suck
because I have to pay you
and I also have to work for you for free.
But I do have one out,
which is that I can flee to a city or a town
where I might get a little bit more of protection
and you know that I can flee.
So that keeps you from treating me too badly.
Yeah, and if you get to a city
and you're able to stay there,
generally the timeframe was one year and one day,
specifically, 366 days,
then you are no longer obligated
to whatever night you fled from.
You are just a free man living in the city.
And also life was way more laid back, he says,
than it is now.
People just weren't working all that often.
They didn't have like a nine to five job.
They wouldn't even understand the idea
of just working all day.
You might work just a couple days a week
whenever your customers showed up, then you'd work.
And if they didn't show up, you wouldn't work.
So I could basically, that doesn't sound that bad at all.
So I can basically work as much as I want.
If I wanna work really hard,
really build my business, I can do that.
Or if I just wanna loaf around, that's okay too.
No, actually you can only loaf around.
Let me see.
This is, when a day leader says
this is one of the biggest differences
between life in a medieval village
and life now, the guild system, which is,
I used to think, oh, guild system,
that's just like unions.
Not at all, it's much more all-encompassing.
The purpose of the guild system
was to eliminate competition.
It is there to benefit producers
at the expense of consumers.
And it limits competition
by forbidding advertising, for example,
by limiting the number of hours
that anyone can work in a given day
by specifically defining the techniques
that each craftsman must follow.
And it squelches innovation.
If you come up with a faster way to make shoes
or a cheaper way to make shoes
and the guild finds that you're doing it,
they will forbid you to practice this craft anymore
because that would give you an unfair advantage
over the other shoemakers
and you'd put them out of business eventually.
And this is something that I find really interesting.
So if we look at European history,
something happens in the late 1700s, early 1800s
that creates the conditions for entrepreneurial investment
and technological investment.
And suddenly, unbelievably rapidly,
workers become much more productive.
At least some workers become far more wealthy.
Many don't, but some do.
This is not happening in the world we're describing
in the 12th and 13th century, right?
Do you see any entrepreneurship
and anything we'd recognize as entrepreneurship?
You do see it.
And the reason why the guilds exist
is precisely to stop it from getting the upper hand.
And if there hadn't been individuals
who were willing to experiment
with new production techniques,
then there would have been no need for guilds to exist.
It's not really until the 14th and 15th centuries though
that you start to see the guild system begin to break down.
And it begins to break down in large part
because of the Black Death
and the loss of one out of three
to one out of two Europeans
and the loss of a four-year, in a four-year period.
And that massive die-off
caused an economic crisis that allowed merchants
who had capital available to them
to begin to buy out artisans.
Essentially, they begin to turn them into wage laborers.
They buy their tools, they buy their shops,
they buy their raw materials,
they start to sell the finished product.
And so the groundwork for that later period
of massive experimentation in the 1700s and 1800s
is really laid back in the 1400s and 1500s.
Wow, so if there had not been the Black Death,
we wouldn't have the modern world that we live in today?
It certainly is a boon to the merchant class
in terms of its relationship
to those who are producing the goods that they sell.
And it's this mercantile class
that later on will begin to experiment
with agricultural techniques in the 18th and 18th century.
So you can draw a connection of sorts there.
But going back to our period,
to the 12th and 13th century,
the 1100s and 1200s,
so if I'm a shoemaker, am I just making shoes?
Like I have size 12 shoes, size eight shoes, whatever,
and I'm just making a bunch of shoes?
Yes, you make the specialization of labor
in the 12th and 13th centuries
is something that's frowned on by guilds
because they see that will lead to skilled dilution
and to the loss of social status and economic clout.
If you're a shoemaker, you make the whole shoe.
You make the soles, you make the tongue,
you make the eyelets, if they have them,
you make the entire product from beginning to end.
And you make to order.
More often than not, you'll sit in your shop
and you don't build shoes on spec.
You wait till somebody places an order
and then you make the shoe,
which helps to account for the very irregular
work patterns for nobody might walk in for four days.
So for four days, you just sit and do nothing.
But again, the guilds regulate membership very closely.
They set a number of shoemakers.
There will be 12 shoemakers in this town.
And they do that to prevent a glut of production,
which would hurt the producers.
And so if you're number 13
and you're trying to make shoes
and they find you're trying to make shoes,
they will knock your house down
and they will take your tools and get rid of them
and try to have you thrown out of the town.
Really?
And would the shoemaker guilds side up
with the glazier guild and the stool
or the woodworker guild or whatever?
Would they work together to beat up on this rogue
under black market shoemaker?
More often than not, no.
And one of the defining characteristics
of the guild system is its intense localization.
Even within a town, the guilds,
there's a pecking order in which some guilds
are considered more prestigious than others.
And this is made manifest in urban festivals
where the guilds will all march in a specific order
that is often laid down in the town's laws.
And rivalry between these guilds was often intense
and when members of one guild met members
of another guild in the street,
they'd probably wind up brawling with one another.
If you met members of the shoemaker's guild
from the neighboring town,
you'd probably brawl with them as well.
Even though I'm a shoemaker in a shoemaker's guild.
That's right.
The idea of workers of the world unite
is not one that anyone would have thought of
in the 12th and 13th centuries.
And the reason why that phrase is so powerful in part
is because it flies in the face
of a much older pre-modern tradition
in which the workers of the world brawled
with one another and were intensely proud
of their own town and of their own guild
within that town to the exclusion of ties
to other guilds and to other places.
So thinking about this economically,
what I'm finding confusing is
there is so much money left on the table.
I mean, we now know with the benefit of hindsight
that if the shoemakers or the clothmakers
or whoever else got together and said,
hey guys, forget this controlling our production.
Let's make as much as we possibly can.
Let's flood the market.
We'll make a lot less on each one,
but we'll sell a lot more units.
People will not buy one pair of shoes every 10 years.
They'll buy one pair of shoes every season
or every few months.
Eventually, we can start selling it
to those neighboring towns and even to other countries
and we'll all be much richer.
And according to a basic principle of modern economics
is if there's a situation where everybody
could be made much richer,
someone will think of it
and someone will take advantage of it.
Why, so on the one hand,
I can see why each guild member
doesn't want any other guild member to do that.
But why didn't anybody think of this?
You know, when a few hundred years later,
everybody's thinking about this.
Right, well, two factors.
One, cultural and the other, technological.
The cultural one is that the Christian milieu
of the time regards money making as a sorted activity.
You know, the usurers, those who lend money at interest
are considered among the worst sinners out there.
And Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century says
there's something sorted about selling and buying goods.
That it's easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter heaven.
So you have these strong cultural constraints
working against trying to amass
as much wealth as possible.
The technological problem is transportation costs.
The idea of mass producing goods
and then flooding markets with them
and trying to maximize profits
by having raises in profit margins
but large number of sales.
It's not possible when overland transportation
is as expensive as it was in the 12th and 13th centuries.
You couldn't move grain profitably overland
probably more than 40 or 50 miles.
At that point it was just too expensive.
And many times there were famines
in the 12th and 13th century
where there was plenty of food 50 miles away.
But it cost too much to load up carts
and move it overland.
The only economical way to move goods
was by water during the Middle Ages.
And until those transportation problems were overcome
it really I think was not possible
to conceive of a world where instead of trying
to make a few sales and make as much profit
on those few sales and abandon that for a world
where you're just gonna make a large number of sales
and a small amount of profit on each one.
I see, because Adam Smith wrote about
how there will be specialization
to the extent of the size of the market.
Right.
And the market was effectively 50 miles or even less.
Yes, it was intensely local.
And when you do see goods being shipped long distances
it's things that have huge value for the weight,
right, spices.
Precisely.
That's right, even cloth which is Europe's main export
to the rest of the world in 12th and 13th century.
Even cloth is starting to, you've reached the limit
of what it's economically profitable to ship
considering the value versus the weight.
And certainly medieval merchants,
they wanted to deal in items such as pepper and spices
that weighed very little and that were quite valuable.
It's really fascinating.
So basically if I'm in a guild I'm just sort of like,
I'm always fighting with somebody
is basically what I got from that.
I'm either fighting with you the night
or I'm fighting with other people in different guilds
or I'm fighting with other people in my same guild
from a different town.
Sort of like, it's a lot of fighting.
It's a lot of fighting and it's a lot of stuff
that has to happen before the preconditions are there
for the industrial revolution
and for the creation of the modern world
that we live in.
Which I learned a lot from him about that.
I never thought about just simply transportation costs.
You can't really have an industrial revolution
until you have roads and ships
that can cheaply go around the world.
Right, right.
So a couple more strikes to my understanding
of what it's like to live in the middle ages.
I will say we're gonna have him on again
to talk about life in the middle ages
versus life in the industrial revolution
and ways in which certainly for the early days
of the industrial revolution for the average person
it might have been a huge step backwards,
not a step forwards.
Although Dayleader does say he would never
in a million years wanna live in the middle ages
if he had to exchange his life now.
Right, right.
It's much tougher.
Than he would know.
So we'll have more of that conversation
on our upcoming podcast.
Thank you to Philip Dayleader,
professor of history at the College of William and Mary.
We'll link to his teaching company lectures on our blog
npr.org slash money.
I highly recommend it.
And please do go to our blog
and the rest of npr.org.
Today is the first day of our new look,
our relaunch site.
I think it's much better.
Yeah, absolutely.
I keep sending us your questions
and letters to planetmoney at npr.org.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
