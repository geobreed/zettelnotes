Congress has been arguing for months now about the best ways to overhaul the American system of financial regulation. It's a tough conversation, because regulation can be bad in a couple of ways. First, regulation can be ineffective, in which case it fails to prevent the outcomes it was designed to block or causes more problems than it solves. Second, regulation can overreach, in which case it stifles financial innovation. After newfangled financial products nearly brought down the global economy last fall, you might think it's not so bad to stifle financial innovation. But financial innovation has also led to prosperity. Atlantic writer Mike Konczal and Columbia Business School economist Charles Calomiris argue the pros and cons of Wall Street creativity.

**faster whisper:**
It told us how close we were to the edge.
But the GDP also revealed that in the last few months,
the economy has done measurably better than we had thought.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Today is Friday, July 31st.
On the show today, we celebrate the genius of Wall Street
and how their fabulous, wonderful financial innovation
has benefited all of us.
You really love to provoke, don't you?
I really, really do.
We're going to be doing that,
but we're also going to have a sober discussion
of the perils and pros of financial innovation
that's coming up.
Yeah, it's not just provoking.
It's hopefully thoughtful and helpful
in thinking about this moment in history.
But first, the Planet Money Indicator.
It is a thrilling negative 1%.
We are ecstatic to be able to report to you
that the U.S. economy slowed down by only 1%
on an annualized basis between April and June of this year.
That's according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Right, one more example
of what seems like pretty lousy news.
We, of course, want the economy to grow generally,
but it's relatively good.
Right, this is way better than the 6.4% shrink
in the first three months of the year.
It's a sign that maybe, just maybe, we can hope,
the economy is on the brink of actually,
next quarter, the quarter after that, going up,
which means no more recession.
All right, we can only hope.
All right, so Adam, we've been talking
about what got us into this recession.
We've been talking to economists and all sorts of people
about how to fix the financial system.
How to write new rules.
And what we've learned talking to economists,
Democrats, Republicans, centrists, all across the spectrum
is that they're worried about things
that are kind of different from, I think,
what most of us, like non-economists, worry about.
They're worried about the cost of bad regulation,
and they're worried about inhibiting financial innovation.
Right, and we're gonna talk about
some of those concerns today,
because it comes up over and over
when you're talking to economists,
but to the rest of us, it's just sort of,
wait, what?
What are you talking about?
And specifically, let's just start
with that second concern.
We'll get to the first one later.
The second concern, inhibiting financial innovation.
Financial innovation, you know?
Right, I mean, I picture a bunch of guys on Wall Street
coming up with new ways to steal money from me,
or some lousy credit card scheme that's gonna hurt me.
But I think it's worth it at this time
to take a step back and think about all the things
that we have gotten from financial innovation.
All the benefits of financial innovation.
And for me, that means talking about American life today
compared to life in the Middle Ages.
So when you think about our life today,
what's just normal,
and you look at just some basic metrics,
how many calories we can eat a day,
how long we live, how tall we get,
how healthy our lives are,
how likely our children are to die,
these basic measures,
the life of any American today is so much better
than the vast majority of human beings
who have ever lived,
and is better almost certainly
than anybody who lived more than, say, 200 years ago.
So from like the dawn of humanity,
100,000 years or whatever it was ago,
to about 200 years ago,
every single person who lived
lived worse than the average American today.
Okay, fine.
But what does that have to do with financial innovation?
All right, let me explain.
So when you think about what was the magic thing
that happened in the 1800s
to make human life so much better now?
I know, I know, I know.
What, sir?
The Industrial Revolution, technology,
the cotton gin, textile machines, the steam engine.
And obviously that is,
it created the conditions
where the same amount of physical effort
by a human being could produce much more output.
So we went from needing 90% of human beings
to produce enough food for us
to less than 2% being able to produce enough food
for us and on and on.
Right, okay.
I'm still waiting for financial innovation.
All right, so what happened in the 1800s
that made us suddenly have this technological revolution?
It wasn't that people suddenly became brilliantly
more ingenious in 1823 or something.
It's that the way our society rewarded ingenuity,
rewarded innovation, invention, changed.
And this, this moment right here,
that is a really key thought here.
And that is what has to do with financial innovation.
The ability to reward a good idea.
Exactly, that simple.
Back in the Middle Ages, actually, frankly,
most of human history and anywhere you look,
Latin America, Asia, Africa, it doesn't matter,
most of human history,
most people did what their dad did.
If you were born a knight,
like I was in our radio drama.
Last week, yes, exactly.
Right.
You didn't have to be particularly smart
or clever or good at being a knight.
You could just go around grabbing stuff from peasants.
And us peasants, as I was in our radio drama.
If we were smart or clever,
we came up with a good idea,
we were geniuses at something,
it didn't matter, you would just steal it,
unite, or the guild that I,
maybe a competing guild,
if I was a shoemaker and I came up with a better way
of making shoes,
some other shoemaking guild would burn my house down
because they didn't want me to have a competitive advantage.
Right, new ideas were punished, not rewarded,
and so we didn't have a lot of new innovations.
But financial innovation solved this problem.
Let's just take a basic example, railroads.
They transformed our way of life,
they greatly increased our standard of living,
we wouldn't live the way we live today without them,
but there's a problem if you want to start a railroad.
Right, if you want to start something big
like a railroad or a factory or whatever,
you need a lot of money,
and in the mid-1800s, nobody had enough money
to start a big trans-continental railroad,
so they needed lots of money
from lots of different people.
And if you picture doing it without,
say, the most famous and successful financial innovation,
the common stock, how would you do that?
You get a million people together,
and each one gives a hundred bucks or 10 bucks
or a thousand bucks,
and you have a room full of lawyers.
I mean, I'm picturing some nightmare scenario
with guys with bowler hats and handlebar mustaches
arguing for hours about, you know,
am I liable if a train hits somebody?
Am I, you know, can I get my money back
if I lose faith in your company?
All of these battles.
Right, and the common stock, if you think about it,
it just really solves a bunch of really key problems,
which is sort of one of them is like,
how do you, the railroad, get access
to those millions of people
with their varying amounts of money?
But it also solves a problem for me
if I have like $10,000 or a thousand spare dollars
or something like that,
and I see this great idea of a railroad
and I know it's gonna take off,
I can now take a piece of that action.
Exactly, it makes everybody better off.
It makes the owner of the railroad better off,
it makes the investor better off,
and it makes us who would get to, you know,
travel around the country
and get cheaper meat from Kansas or whatever,
better off.
Charles Calamaris is a financial historian
at Columbia University, he's also an economist.
He said this idea of financial innovation,
extending it to stocks and bonds
and interest rate swaps and on and on and on
is so crucial to our way of life.
It is the golden goose, the financial system.
You know, Rick Mishkin likes to say
the financial system is the brain of the economy
and I've adopted that view.
I think it gets people to understand
what you're talking about very quickly
because you can't function without a brain.
Why is it the brain of the economy?
Because it's, first and foremost,
it decides how to allocate investable funds.
We have a mechanism through the financial system
of figuring out who should get money and who shouldn't.
And when you give money to people who should,
it makes us all more productive as a society.
That basic function of allocating capital
is at its core the most important single function
that the financial system serves.
But to allocate that capital,
it also has to manage risk,
it has to figure out how to share risk.
We get then into derivatives products
and other kinds of innovative products.
Investment banking products, they're very innovative,
helping firms figure out how to raise funds in new ways.
Communication globally that improves our ability
to track firms and evaluate them better
and expand access to markets
by being able to share risks globally.
All of these things translate into
being able to do more, better, faster, smarter,
because the financial system
ultimately is the brain of the economy.
And financial innovation
is about making your brain work better.
All right, here's where the, you know,
but please, economists please.
You and I, you know,
you and I have been basically making our career
for the last two years,
doing stories of how financial innovation
nearly brought down the world.
And you're gonna tell me that
the no-doc option arm mortgage adds 10 years to my life,
has made my life better in any way.
Well, the interest only no-doc option arm mortgage.
No, obviously not, no.
You know, there's actually this argument
that you and I have really been fascinated by.
I associate with some work being done
at NYU Stern School of Business
that since around 1980 or so,
on balance financial innovation has hurt the world,
has made us a bit poorer.
That's an argument we don't know yet.
The data's not in, but I do believe very strongly,
and I think it's pretty clear that on balance,
if you just take the category of financial innovation
over the last two, three centuries,
it has been a huge boon.
The list is endless, you know,
the 401k, the mutual fund,
interest-bearing savings accounts, commercial paper.
I mean, I think you and I,
when we learned about how amazing commercial paper is,
the way it allows businesses
that have a bit of extra cash at the end of the day
to lend it to folks who need it for a few hours
and that it provides this constant act,
flowing of funds that makes our economy
work much, much better.
I mean, that thing is awesome.
Right, and that is why commercial paper rocks, man.
It's awesome, I'm so psyched.
I love commercial paper.
So that's why it's tough, you know?
I mean, like Congress wants to keep banks
from being stupid, and they wanna keep banks
from taking down the whole economy with them
when they are stupid,
but they also, if there is a good idea
and occasionally they come up with one,
that'll help us all,
they wanna preserve that option.
Right, the goose and all the golden eggs.
Right, and we want them to be able to do that, right?
Which is why economists talk about financial innovation
differently than the rest of us talk about it.
Okay, so that's financial innovation.
That's what economists are thinking about.
Let's not do something that ruins that.
Right, now, what about regulation?
This seems like a no-brainer again
to a lot of people, right?
Like we had, clearly, there weren't enough regulations
in place, so we just need to regulate more.
That's a view.
I'd say that the economists we talked to,
again, left, right, and center,
generally say there was a lot of regulation.
There just wasn't smart regulation all the time.
Regulation is, a lot of the time,
specifically designed to stop financial folks
from pursuing their new ideas
or shaping the way they do pursue new ideas.
And it is very hard for regulators in Congress
to know ahead of time,
to predict which new ideas will end up hurting us
and which ones will end up helping us.
Right, and then, this is the other thing
that economists know, I think,
better than the average person.
They study this all the time.
The dangers of bad regulation.
In other words, you can pass some new regulation
that you think, and everybody thinks maybe,
is gonna help make everything better,
but that actually ends up,
through unforeseen consequences,
making things actually worse.
It doesn't just stifle innovation that might help us,
but it actually increases bad things for us.
So, we asked Charles Kalamiris for an example
of some regulation, well-meaning,
what seemed like smart, sensible regulation
that ended up hurting things.
And he said the best example he can think of
is from the 1990s,
rules about how banks deal with the loans
on their books.
So, the basic problem is this,
as we now know all too well,
banks have all these different kinds of loans.
We now hear about bad assets, toxic assets,
but back then, it was just assets,
and some loans are more risky,
they're more likely to go bad,
some loans are less risky, they're safer,
and banks need to have some money on hand
in case a loan goes bad.
They call it equity capital.
Right, and the idea is that the riskier your loan is,
the more equity capital you have to hold.
And so, regulators from all over the world
got together and came up with which loans are risky,
which loans are safer,
and how much equity capital
do you have to hold against the risky loans,
and how much equity capital
do you have to hold against the safe loans?
And we should just note that banks hate
holding equity capital
because that means they're not making a lot of money on it,
so banks wanna hold as little capital as possible.
So, Charles Kalamiris explained how this worked.
The old rule said that mortgages
are half as risky as commercial loans.
So, what that means is,
if you set up a rule that says
you only have to hold half as much equity capital
against a mortgage as you do against a commercial loan,
irrespective of whether the commercial loan
is to a very low-risk company,
and whether the mortgage might be,
let's call it a subprime mortgage,
well, that's a rule of thumb
that probably never made much sense,
but certainly doesn't make sense
when you have leverage ratios on mortgages
that are at 100%,
and you have no-docs mortgages,
and you have all those other things.
So, as soon as you create a rule that says
mortgages are half as risky as commercial loans,
then maybe that rule encourages a behavior
that is in the direction of making mortgages riskier.
Now, I just wanna make sure I understand this.
We've done some reporting.
We talked to one guy in the course of our reporting
who got a loan who had,
he got a half a million dollar loan,
and he had three not-steady jobs,
and he was making a combined income
of about $45,000 a year.
That guy got a half a million dollar loan from a bank,
and you're saying-
And I think never paid, ever paid a payment, or?
No, I think he paid a payment, but he was, yeah.
He was far behind.
Yeah, he was far behind.
And you're saying that the bank who made that loan
to that guy say they had to hold some kind of capital
against that loan.
They had to say, okay,
we're gonna make this half a million dollar loan,
but we're gonna hold $100,000 in capital,
$10,000, $5,000, whatever.
They have to hold some amount of money against that loan.
And you're saying that if they had made that loan
to IBM, they would have had to hold more capital?
Well, that's definitely true.
It's really crazy when you think about it, isn't it?
Yeah, and listen to the point,
which is that the very act of creating that rule
made mortgages more risky, because banks like risk.
They don't like holding equity capital.
The rules set up a way to take on more risk
in exactly the area you don't want it to be.
So I find this really profound,
because what he's saying,
and lots of other people say,
is that a lot of the problems we've been facing
in the subprime crisis,
I think Charles said 20% of the whole problem,
something like that,
are not the result of bad banks
skirting good regulations.
They're the result of banks obeying bad regulations.
Now, I noticed you didn't say good banks
obeying bad regulations.
Well, look, to an economist,
there's no such thing as a good bank or a bad,
well, there is,
but they don't really think of a bank in that way.
They think a bank is just a profit-seeking machine.
That is what it does.
And the goal should not be to make banks
become morally good.
Banks are always gonna,
like all profit-seeking companies
are gonna do whatever they can,
generally within the law most of the time,
to make money.
And I'm not trying to argue
that we're gonna let the banks off the hook.
Clearly, they did lots and lots of things,
obviously, to create this crisis.
Right, but the point is we need to encourage them
to pursue their greed
in ways that actually helps, not hurts us.
All right, so this is all very theoretical,
all the stuff we're talking about.
So I'd like to bring it into the real world
and see how this actually works.
Right, so we talked to basically a financial engineer,
Mike Konzol.
He's a blogger for The Atlantic.
He also has a job working for a financial firm
that helps companies manage risk.
And we asked him a very simple question,
what we thought was a simple question.
We said, can you give us an example
of a good financial innovation
and a bad financial innovation from the last 20 years?
And so he started with a good one.
Sure, so we have the CDS instrument, right?
Credit default swap.
A credit default swap,
which is a way of insuring against bonds.
I think the CDS instrument was very crucial
in making the 2001 recovery,
after 9-11 and after the tech bubble,
go much smoother.
Because of Enron and because of a couple other
large blowups, people were very nervous
about taking on corporate debt.
There's a lot of concern that there's systematic
book cooking going on at all these corporations.
So if you had money to lend,
but you were nervous, you could insure part of it.
So it became a little cheaper overall for everyone.
Right, basically, credit default swaps
helped good companies borrow money more cheaply
than they would have otherwise,
because everyone was so freaked out about Enron.
All right, so there we go.
We asked him for a good financial innovation
and he said, great, credit default swaps,
great financial innovation.
So then we said the next obvious question,
can you give us an example of a really bad
financial innovation,
something that really made the world worse?
CDSs were also a terrible innovation
because they allowed a lot of corporations to,
well, a lot of investment firms
to skirt regulatory regimes.
Basel II had certain requirements
about how much debt you could take on.
And the CDS was almost engineered
to be able to sneak around that regulation.
And Basel II is basically the rules governing banks
and what they're allowed to do, right?
Right, but wait, go back to the main thing here.
We asked him for two different things.
We asked him, what is the best innovation
you can think of in the last 10 years?
Credit default swaps.
What is the worst innovation
you can think of in the last 10 years?
Credit default swaps.
So you're really making me see
how complicated this area is,
because we asked you for one example
of a really good financial product
and one example of a really bad financial product
and you gave us the same product, right?
Yeah, yeah.
And I think a lot of people are coming to that realization
that a lot of these innovations can be used
to extend credit to make the economy more efficient.
But on the other hand, they can also be used
to kind of sneak by the rules
we want everyone to play by.
And then once one company sneaks by,
everyone else has to kind of sneak by
to keep up with them essentially
to keep their numbers solid.
So this is why I sometimes get a headache.
Sometimes I have trouble sleeping at night.
It's so complicated.
How do you create a regulatory system
that rewards innovation and that rewards good innovation
and punishes bad innovation
when it's so often all the same thing?
I know, it really is.
And I feel like that's why it's sort of like,
you see the appeal of sort of saying like,
well, just ban it all or just allow it all.
It sort of, it allows,
it keeps you from having to sort of
wade into this muddy middle area
where it's really hard to figure out
what's the right thing to do.
And while I do reserve the right
to become a rigid ideologue
to avoid having to think about all this,
for the time being, I think Planet Money
will focus on this muddy middle
and try to see what makes sense.
Right, and we will be talking a lot more
about financial innovation, good or bad.
There's actually a really interesting argument
that we're gonna be discussing in an upcoming podcast
about how for the last 20 years,
maybe all of it's been bad.
Or on balance it's been bad.
Or on balance it's been bad, right.
And we're gonna talk about that later on.
For today, I think that wraps it up.
