The planet's rich nations met this week to discuss, among other issues, ways to help the planet's poor nations. But those poor nations have their own group. It's called the anti-G20, in a nod to the G20 collection of industrialized states. The anti-G20 met at the U.N. last month, where Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Martin Khor explained what keeps impoverished countries down. Answer: Their debt to the IMF and wealthier nations. Plus: a second look at the surprisingly complex financial lives of the poor, with a focus on burial societies and very alternative banks.

The planet's rich nations met this week to discuss, among other issues, ways to help the planet's poor nations.

But those poor (and developing) nations have their own group. It's called the anti-G20, in a nod to the G20 collection of industrialized states. The anti-G20 met at the U.N. last month, where Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Martin Khor explained what keeps impoverished countries down. Answer: Their debt to the IMF and wealthier nations.

We also take a second look at the surprisingly complex financial lives of the poor, with a focus on burial societies and very alternative banks.

Bonus: A mildly sunny indicator.

    I have a number for you! 10,623.

    That's how much I earned last quarter on one of my retirement plans, after having posted losses, for what, a year or more?

    Of course it's still worth less than when I opened it in early 2001 (just in time to see it take a big fall after 9/11... sigh) but this gain has to mean something!

For what it's worth, she's the second person this week to tell me they opened an investment statement and got good news.

**faster whisper:**
While our markets are improving, and we appear to have averted global collapse, we know that
too many people are still struggling. So we agree that full recovery is still a ways off.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson in still very sunny and
beautiful New York City. You guys are such show-offs. I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt. It is
beautiful as usual in Seattle here. Today is Friday, July 10th. And today, Adam, on
the show, we are going to ask, what if all those poor countries that owe us money and
they owe China money and the IMF, what if we all just said, you know what? Forget
it. You guys don't have to pay us back. It's cool. And speaking of poor countries,
we're going to be following up on Wednesday's show where we looked at people around the
world living on $2 a day. But first, our Planet Money indicator.
The indicator today is $25.96 billion. That is the trade deficit for the month of
May. So that means you add all the stuff that the U.S. sold to other countries
and then you subtract all the stuff that we buy from other countries and you find
out what we spent is about $26 billion more than we earned.
And that actually, there's a truism in economics, which means that if we spent $26 billion
more than we earned from the rest of the world, that means we had to borrow $26 billion
one way or another to buy all that stuff. So we got further in debt to the rest of
the world. But $26 billion, that actually counts as really good news. For years,
the trade gap was much higher. I was the guy at NPR for many years who covered the
trade gap as one of the things I covered. And every month, I would say, and once again,
the U.S. has a historically high trade deficit, $50 billion, $58 billion, $60 billion,
$62 billion every month, month after month.
So to you, this number sounds low. It's the lowest it's ever been since 1999.
Yeah, it sounds shockingly low. It is victory. Well, it's a sad little victory.
We still have a high trade deficit, but it's a lot lower than it used to be
because, of course, we're in a recession. People just aren't spending a lot of
money. And the big question, and this is a big question for the next several
decades, is has the U.S. made a fundamental shift? Are we likely as a
society, as a country, to spend something closer to what we earn in real time?
Or are we likely to, just when this recession is over, go back to borrowing
and spending huge amounts of money?
I'm all into closing the trade deficit, Adam. I just want it to be after I
get my new laptop. I'd also like a new car and a Barbie playhouse.
No, I'm just kidding.
Yes, but well, that's exactly the point. Is this all pent up demand?
And as soon as people start feeling more optimistic, are they just going to
blow all the money they saved during this recession?
Right. So the question is, will I be able to hold myself back from buying
that laptop?
So now, Adam, let's move on to countries that are more indebted than we
are. So you sat down with our intern, Matt Katz, to talk about poor
countries and debt.
So we are going to dip our toe a little bit more into the life for the
poorest in the world, although we didn't go very far this time.
I guess we could have gone to some part of sub-Saharan Africa or India or
Latin America or wherever.
But instead, since it was our poor intern, Matt Katz, we just told him to
walk about five or six blocks over to the United Nations, which had a
conference on the economic crisis and how it's affecting development for the
poorest countries in the world.
And Matt, from what I understand, it was pretty echoey in the hall when
you were there.
Yeah, not too many people showed up.
It wasn't taken very seriously.
The UN was hoping for it to be this sort of anti-G20.
It was supposed to be a meeting of every single country instead of just
the top 20 richest ones.
And they really wanted people to come from the highest level, like world
leaders. But besides a couple of Caribbean presidents, not many people
showed up. Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez actually had been scheduled to
come and give press conferences.
And then when the time came, they just never showed up.
Which is so... I mean, you think of the UN and global poverty and, I
don't know, what's more important for folks?
I guess they just didn't respect this conference for some reason.
I guess not. But I mean, the cool thing was that it was really easy to
get some time with some interesting, big, important people in the global
poverty world. And I managed to speak with the top economist at the
conference, Joseph Stiglitz.
Of course, he was chief economist at the World Bank.
And he also won a Nobel Prize in economics, like you do.
And he teaches at Columbia.
He does. Yes.
And I spoke to him about what's keeping poor countries down,
especially since the recession hit.
And he told me that it's all about debt.
Many countries have basically a choice.
Do they make their debt payments or do they provide health and
education? Basic level, not high level.
And the debt bill is coming due this year for these countries.
The UN says that they're going to owe three billion dollars to other
countries and about a billion dollars to private lenders.
And those numbers are actually set to grow, Stiglitz says.
What's happened is is that the recession has had big consequences for
these countries. Developing countries like those in Asia have made
a lot of money building computer chips and stuff for us, for America
and Europe. And that demand has gone down ever since the recession
hit. And poor countries that rely a lot on exporting natural resources
like oils and metals have been hit hard by the fall in prices for those
products. So they owe all this money.
Who do they owe the money to?
Well, there's the World Bank and there's the IMF, as you would think.
And there are also a lot of countries that hold a whole ton of foreign
debt, like China and Japan and the U.S.
And even some big banks like Citibank and JP Morgan.
Yeah, this always blew my mind when I first learned about it.
But the U.S.
just issues debt, it issues bonds when it wants to borrow money.
But to learn that lots of countries in the world, they actually call up
Citibank and say, hey, can you can you lend us a few billion bucks?
Yeah, it's almost like going down the street to your local bank and
getting a mortgage, but on a much bigger scale.
And they've actually been looking to take out more and more loans to make
up for all the money they've lost in the recession.
I spoke to another economist there at the conference, Martin Corr.
And he told me about this this cycle of debt that countries face.
They borrow new money in order to pay back the old money, and then they
will not be able to pay back the new money and they borrow again and so on.
And after 10 or 15 years of this charade, you know, everybody came to
their senses and said, look, let's eliminate the debt or let's have a
have a partial debt relief, but you have to go through 10 to 15 years of
hell and the country in the meanwhile suffers.
I don't need to make light of it, but it reminds me of my 20s having
credit card debt and then you borrow money on another credit card to pay
off the credit card that's next up this cycle of borrowing to pay off
debt and then you have more debt, et cetera.
Well, that's exactly it.
Except instead of credit card companies and a bill, they owe this money to
the IMF and to China and countries like that and Corrin Stiglitz say
that the debt crisis facing these countries is in a lot of ways, just
like the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit crunch that happened
year and a lot of these borrowers are actually likely to default.
Like it or not, some of these countries won't be paying it back.
Just like in the United States, many, many people are walking away from
their, what they owe in their homes for the simple reason they can't pay
what's on their homes and poor countries are like poor, poor Americans.
They can't pay what they owe.
They'd like to be able to.
And the only thing you can do in those circumstances is to
give people a fresh start.
Nouriel Roubini, the economist we've had on a lot from NYU who
predicted so much of this crisis.
He said that this, he said for years now that this wasn't
just a subprime housing crisis.
It was a subprime country crisis that many high debt countries got,
got more money than they probably would under normal circumstances
because of the crazy economy we had.
But it sounds like what Stiglitz is saying is, so let's just do a do-over.
Let's just get rid of all the debt they've taken on.
Well, they kind of are and that's Stiglitz and Core.
They have a couple of recommendations.
They want to institute this moratorium on debt, basically
make it so that countries in debt won't accrue any interests or
have to pay anything back until the recession is over.
And I'm not entirely sure how they're going to tell the
recession is over, but there is a precedent for that.
The IMF did that after the tsunami in Asia in 2004.
They just put a freeze on the debt for all the affected countries.
But Stiglitz actually had another recommendation.
What you do is you look at the origins of the debt, the capacity
of the country to repay the debt, the efforts that exerting and
you make a judgment of how much the country can repay and the
rest has to be written off.
There's no collateral like there is when you buy a home.
You can't take a country over.
But what you do need to do is inevitably in one way or
another to forgive the debt.
So maybe not all the debt, but it sounds like a lot of the
debt does just disappear.
It just never gets paid back.
Yeah.
And in terms of international finance, that could be easily
billions of dollars.
I feel like mixed on this, just what's going through my mind.
On the one hand, I feel like if you lend money, just like if a
bank lends money to a subprime borrower, it's on both of them
if the subprime borrower can't pay back.
You can't just blame the subprime borrower.
The bank didn't do good risk analysis.
And it sounds like maybe that's what happened in some
of these loans.
On the other hand, it's a little scary to say, OK, you
can get way in over your head.
You can borrow a ton of money and then we'll just write it
off billions and billions of dollars.
We're just going to write off.
You know, I thought the same thing, but Khor, he actually
argues that we kind of owe it to all of these countries.
They had no part in this crisis.
You cannot blame them for this.
It's not that they overspent or they were profligate or
they were corrupt or whatever it is.
So they are the innocent victims of a collateral damage
of an earthquake that took place somewhere else.
You know, the epicenter is here and we should treat them as
we treat the victims of a tsunami.
And that's another thing.
The tsunami, which I covered, it was awful and it was but
it was one small part of the world and it severely
affected them and the rest of the world was unaffected.
And so you can understand how the rest of the world can
help. But this crisis is everywhere.
I mean, we here in the US are having a pretty hard time.
So how does the whole world come together to help the
whole world?
It's really confusing.
But the one thing I noticed at the conference was that
there's a lot of blame centered squarely on the US
and a lot of these guys, they're sort of left wing and
they really wanted the US to basically pay for all of
the trouble they say that it caused.
But it's not the only idea that's floating around out
there. Most of the people at this conference were pretty
much in the same boat with Stiglitz and Core.
So I called up this guy, William Easterly.
He's a professor of economics at NYU and he's often
pretty critical of these sort of foreign aid plans.
He thinks that these countries are a lot like subprime
mortgage borrowers, but in a different kind of way.
He says that repeatedly forgiving debt like this is
causing what he calls a moral hazard, which is
basically, like you said, these countries being
addicted to free credit.
The poor countries will have the incentive to borrow
more because they can rationally anticipate that
the debt will be forgiven in the future.
In fact, that may have been what explains the
surge in debt that happened after the previous
success and debt forgiveness, which happened in 2005.
Bill Easterly has written several fascinating
books, White Man's Burden, and I forgot the
other one anyway, about the downside of foreign
aid and these kinds of plans.
I mean, I might be summarizing them incorrectly,
but that when the U.S.
or other developed nations spend billions of
dollars to help out these poor countries,
sometimes it reinforces existing power structures.
It prevents the needed changes that could help
the country really leave poverty.
What's he saying here?
He basically wants us to spend our money on
strategies that let the poor countries help
themselves because right now he says we're
treating them more like helpless victims and
that's not really empowering them and it's
reinforcing those power structures, like you said.
And there actually was someone at the UN
conference that agreed with him in this way.
His name is Yu Dongding, and he's a former
member of the Monetary Policy Committee for
China's Central Bank.
Lots of countries, China's old friends, we
should help them when they are in need.
China will help those countries who borrow
from China to rebuild their economy, to
de-hurt the economy so that they will be
able to return money as much as possible.
So what kind of help is he talking about
that China's going to give these poor countries?
Well, it's almost exactly what you would
expect from China.
China can provide technical assistance to
those countries and we can help them to
train engineers and nurses and teachers and
so on.
We can also invest in those countries,
direct investment.
That is not a free gift, right?
We need profit and so on, but direct
investment will be very helpful for those
countries which do not have enough
financial resources.
So his plan is we'll help them, but
we'll also expand our influence.
We'll possibly have more access to their raw
materials.
We'll have deeper ties.
It's a practical approach.
Exactly.
It sort of benefits China just a little
bit.
And China's already hugely invested in a
lot of African countries.
And at least according to you, it looks
like they're interested in investing a lot
more.
Matt Katz, our intern.
Thank you.
This was excellent.
And you know what?
Next time you did so well.
We are going to send you anywhere you
want to go in Brooklyn or Queens.
All right.
Pizza shops.
I'm up for that.
Thanks, guys.
So now we want to do a little bit of
follow up from Wednesday's podcast.
We were talking about financial
instruments that people around the
world use, people who live on two
dollars a day.
Hannah, your folks are from South Africa,
right?
Yes.
So I was, you had talked a lot about
burial societies in South Africa, which
are really interesting groups of people
who get together and invest their money
for funerals.
So my friend Gretchen Wilson, she works
as a reporter in Johannesburg, and she
just asked around in her building for
people who invest in burial societies.
And she said tons of people told her,
yeah, I do.
So, Adam, you called one of them.
We gave a call to Richard Mudao.
He lives in Johannesburg, South Africa,
and someone Gretchen knows.
We got him on his cell phone.
The phone line sound quality is not that
great. And Richard has has a bit of an
accent. So I'm going to quickly paraphrase
what he told me.
So this is a guy he makes.
I'm going to look up the exchange
rates. I have it right in front of me.
He makes two thousand rand a month,
which according to Google is around
two hundred and fifty dollars a month.
That is a bit more than the two
dollars a day type of income that we
were talking about the other day.
And he says of that two hundred and
fifty dollars, he puts around two
hundred rand or twenty five
dollars every month into
two different burial societies.
So the idea is every month, it's kind
of like an insurance plan, but a very
specific one every month.
He puts twenty five bucks into
these burial societies.
And he says it's automatically
deducted from his bank account.
And if someone in his family dies, it
could be him, his wife, his
parents or his kid.
Then that funeral insurance
burial society will pay
part of the funeral.
They'll give around ten thousand
rand. And since I'm not that quick
on math, I'm looking that up.
That is around twelve hundred
U.S. dollars for the funeral.
It'll be a bit less for a kid,
maybe half that if his kid dies.
Now, if he didn't have this burial
society, he'd have to save for
years. And if he wanted to cover
everyone in his family, that would
be many, many years of savings.
So he says this is
a great way to ensure he has
enough to cover a funeral if
someone dies or that his family
can if he dies.
But Richard says the payout,
even twelve hundred dollars, it's
nowhere near enough to pay for
the entire cost of the funeral.
Yeah, it will cost more than
thousand because we have to buy
ECOC. We have to buy maybe
ECOC to prepare the food
for the people who can
people that they like the
relatives and other people
around where we were staying.
They used to come and help
every day so that so that they
can they want to
they were to support support
with them with their food.
That's why we use
a lot of money.
Someone may be stuck there.
We can spend maybe twenty to
twenty thousand.
Wow. So ten thousand will
not do it all.
No, we do it all.
That's why if maybe
you've got a
a funeral scene to the
to the other company and they've
got to maybe to the other
card that is better because
you can get ten ten to
to those two different
policies. You see, it will
be better. Maybe you can just
put a seven thousand or
five thousand on top so that
you can bury
your member.
And what if you said.
If if someone died and
you said, forget it, we're not
paying for the funeral, we
won't have a lot of
family, we won't pay, we
won't give food.
What would happen?
No, this is our tradition.
You see, all the
even if someone
but it's not my family
or the people who are living
with they used all the
people there that they're
doing. So there is
is there a traditional
is the way we
used to.
It's the way you do things.
Yes, yeah.
It's our tradition in
other ways.
It's your tradition.
You have to do it.
Yeah, you have to do it.
It is they enjoy if maybe
someone passed away
to prepare the food and
everything, the cold drink or
liquor, you see.
Oh, liquor, too.
Yeah, liquor, too.
So, Hanna, he said that
at around twenty five
thousand rand per funeral,
this isn't the most expensive
thing that he will ever
have to pay for.
He said a wedding is is
more than twice that.
So a funeral is around
three thousand U.S.
dollars.
And again, this is a man
who makes around two
hundred and fifty dollars
a month.
A wedding would be closer to
six thousand or even more.
And there is no wedding
insurance scheme.
But the funeral scheme,
he says, is very helpful.
It makes him feel that he can
help his family when
the time comes.
Right. And it sort of sounds
morbid to plan for your
child's funeral.
But it's it's not as if he's,
you know, planning for the
for the kids funeral soon.
It's just sort of being
responsible and really seen
as a big part of the
culture that it's important
to be responsible in this
way.
Exactly. And as he said,
he never he doesn't know
when a tragedy will happen.
And this way he knows his
family is covered.
People who heard Wednesday's
podcast know that that we
were looking at all the
many complicated and
interesting financial
products and solutions
exist for some
of the poorer people in
the world to solve their
problems so that they can
make their money work
for them, even in
poverty.
Yeah. And one of those
things were called rascas.
So those are rotating
savings and credit
associations.
So we heard that they were
used by poor people in
India and South Africa and
Bangladesh.
But Laurie Hilton heard
that she lives in New
York. And she said these
are not just tools that
are used in faraway
places. They are also
used by immigrant
communities in the U.S.
They are also used by
immigrant communities right
here. And our producer
Caitlin Kenny talked to
Laurie to find out what
her raska was like.
In my community, I
guess, in the West Indian
community, we generally
refer to it as a partner
and basically it works
a lot like what was
described in your last
podcast, where a group
of people get together.
They each week contribute
a certain amount of
money. So the one I
was doing was like
one hundred dollars a
week for six months.
And they determined one
person to be the quote
unquote banker.
And that person collects
the money from each
person every week and
they get a small
percentage of of the
money collected as, you
know, a fee for doing
the banking and keeping
track of everything.
And then it goes to one
one person out of the
group and everyone gets
a turn and they're
able to use the money
for any number of
things. I used my
money for well that
month I was out of
work. So for paying
the rent and paying
down some debt.
Was this an organization
that you sought out
because you were looking
for some financial help
or was it something
someone invited you to
join something that I
was invited to join.
I mean they're pretty
common. So you know I
have cousins who either
run them or are in one.
This one I got to hear
about from my sister's
ex-husband. He was
actually organizing it.
And so he was collecting
the money every week.
So I've never I've
never really had to
seek it out. But I
always know about one
going on somewhere.
And how does someone
become the quote unquote
banker.
Well if you choose
to organize one then
you would be by
default. You could
become the banker by
default. But I think
it's really kind of
a it's about a trust
relationship. So it's
it's it's I guess the
banker is selected by
the people you know
the people that you
trust the most to do
it. It's usually the
organizer though.
And how many people
were in Eurasia.
Oh I don't know.
Wow that's pretty big.
Yeah. Is that typical
for the average size
that you would see.
I don't know. It
depends. It depends
on how many weeks
and how many how
many weeks and how
much. So they can be
anywhere from I'd say
probably the smallest is
about 20 people 25
people. I don't think
you'd want to get
smaller than that
because you wouldn't
necessarily be able to
build up you know a
large enough amount of
money.
And how did you decide
who gets the money
every month that people
sort of appeal and say
well I need it this month
because so and so
or is it.
Oh you usually negotiate
that with a banker.
So the banker
basically puts together
a list of who's going
to get the money when
and you try and you
know you can say oh
I don't need it for
a while or you know
I need it right up
front or you know.
Right. Yeah.
And one of the things
when we talk to Darrell
Collins and Jonathan
Murdoch about their
book Portfolios of
the Poor that they
mentioned that a lot
of the Roscoe's they
encountered had very
specific uses that
people were saving up
the money for whether
it was for school
fees or for women
in the village to buy
a bunch of pots.
Did everyone have
similar goals going
into the Roscoe or is
it everyone has just
their own individual
need.
I don't know most of
the people other people
who are in it the
person that I was
connected to it through
is the banker who was
my my brother-in-law.
So I don't know what
the other people were
using their money for.
But it could yeah it
could have been anything.
Like I said I mean
depending on the size
I know my my cousin
was in one where
it was pretty large
and it went on for
over a year and she
used her money to buy
a house.
Wow.
You know she used the
money for her deposit.
So it just depends.
You mostly mostly don't
know the other people
in the circle.
So the the person
that you have the
relationship with is
the banker.
So you're not getting
together and your
money in every week.
Oh no no it's not
like we get together
and you know it's
like a weekly party
or gathering or
something like that
and we have dinner
and hand over our money.
No it's it really is
like a business
transaction.
I know that I have to
get my money to
the banker by Friday
at six o'clock or
something like that.
So either it goes
in the mail or I go
by his house to drop
it off or something
like that.
And why did you choose
a Roska instead of
you know a more
traditional
financial instrument bank
account you know money
market account
something like that.
Why was the Roska the
route you decided to go.
I guess for me it is
the traditional method
because that's what I
was it's something
that's not foreign to
me because it's something
that my family has
always done.
However I guess
one of the appealing
factors was getting
the money in a lump
sum. I was able to
get an early hand
you know your draw.
We call that a hand.
So I was able to get a
relatively early hand
which meant that I was
basically you know
operating on credit.
So it was like an
interest free loan for me.
And do you think of it
you know people when
we first had this
conversation about the
idea of Roskas and
burial societies
you know we talked about
how they were financial
instruments but people
don't you know it's
kind of a different
association with that
word. Do you think of
it in your head as sort
of a financial
instrument. Do you lump
it along with a bank
account or is it sort
of you know in a
different category for
you.
I guess it is a financial
instrument. I hadn't
thought about it that
way at all until I
heard the interview
the podcast.
But yeah it is a
financial instrument and
I think it's a really
legitimate one.
So Laurie says she
would like to take part
in a Roska again but
it would be hard because
she now lives outside
the city and most of
the people she'd want to
participate in a Roska
with live inside the
city.
You know Hannah I have
an idea. Why don't we
start a Planet Money
Roska. I could be the
banker.
Of course you would be
the banker Adam. You
want to get the cut.
Hey I'm an entrepreneur.
So keep sending us your
stories on the economy

You can comment on our

I want to thank Caitlin
Kenny and Jacob Gans
who produced today's
podcast. They produce
every podcast. They
worked particularly hard
this week. I'm very
grateful.
If anyone's going to be
running the Planet Money
Roska I think it's them
Adam.
Yeah you're right.
I think you're right.
All right. I'm Adam
Davidson and I'm
Klanna Jaffee-Walt.
Thanks for listening.
