Gather 'round, economy nerds. This week the Financial Accounting Standards Board gave banks a break from mark-to-market accounting. Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson tease apart the knotty questions of what this means, why this matters, and who won what. Plus: China gets almost nothing it wanted out of the G20 summit. And listener Aimee Ennis checks in from a neighborhood on hold.

CITIZEN COPE: (Singing) Let the drummer kick, let the drummer kick that. Let the drummer kick, let the drummer kick that. Let the drummer kick...

HILDA SOLIS: Our priority is putting people first, the middle-class families that have been affected for the last two years, and really making sure that they receive whatever full assistance they can. So we're doing this around the clock. We're not going to stop, and we're not going to let these numbers deter us.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

And I'm Alex Blumberg. And that was Labor Secretary Hilda Solis you just heard now, talking about the unemployment numbers, which just came out today. And we're going to be talking about those later, as well, Adam, as mark-to-market accounting.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And I think, Alex, you and I are very sympathetic to those listeners of ours out there who are saying, wait, how did I become the kind of person who listens to a podcast about mark-to-market accounting? Welcome to our world.

BLUMBERG: Exactly (laughter). It is a big issue because the...

DAVIDSON: The future of the world depends on it.

BLUMBERG: It's not even a stretch to say that. There was a little rule that was changed that has to do with mark-to-market accounting. And it sort of governs the way banks value the things that they own. Some people say this rule change will help - mark-to-market accounting is what got us into this mess and changing it will get us out of the mess. Other people tear the out of the head and wail it with despair and say, no, this is exactly the wrong thing to do. Mark-to-market accounting is exactly what we need. And changing this rule is...

DAVIDSON: It's an invitation to banks to lie.

BLUMBERG: To lie, exactly.

DAVIDSON: So we're going to talk about that. But also on today's show, we have just a little something about the G20 summit, another mysterious thing. You hear this phrase in the news, the G20 summit. It sure sounds important, but what's going on there? And we have a lovely listener postcard from a half-built subdivision. But first, Alex, the PLANET MONEY indicator, - 663,000.

BLUMBERG: That is the number of jobs that were lost last month. Again, millions of jobs were created in the U.S. last month, millions more were eliminated. The difference between the jobs created and lost is that number, negative 663,000, not good. The unemployment rate is now at 8.5%, which - we get tired of saying this - is the highest rate since 1983.

DAVIDSON: Right. And that number is really just a part of the overall story. There's also at least 9 million Americans who are, what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls, part-time for economic reasons. Which means these are people, obviously, who want a full-time job, who'd like a full-time job, but they can't get a full-time job. So they're not unemployed, but they're not making enough probably to live on.

BLUMBERG: Right. And that 9 million number is also near a 25-year high. And, of course, this is the situation. This unemployment situation is sort of affecting countries all over the world. And it's what everyone in the world is trying to fix. Specifically, the leaders of the so-called G20.

DAVIDSON: It includes the leaders of the world's 20 largest economies. And they were in London yesterday, Thursday, for a single day. And when you get the leaders of the 20 richest countries, what happens in a single day? They come out with a $1.1 trillion plan. This is money that they, collectively, are going to spend. A lot of that money is going to go to the International Monetary Fund, sort of like an emergency fund for the world, to help bail out countries that have gotten into serious economic trouble.

BLUMBERG: And lately, that's been in places like Iceland and Hungary. The G20 also took steps toward tightening financial regulations, which was a big concern for continental Europe. The communique from this meeting specifically mentions cracking down on hedge funds and tax havens.

DAVIDSON: It actually says, the era of banking secrecy is over. There's so much nice language in there that our own Laura Conaway called up our good friend, economist Adam Posen with the Peterson Institute. He was there at the meeting. He was - although he's American, he was advising the U.K. on its agenda. And Laura asked him why it sounded like a Hallmark card, how nicely this thing was written.

BLUMBERG: Everybody was getting along. And Adam Posen said, well, there was one big player who stands to be unhappy, China.

ADAM POSEN: It's very hard to see what China got out of this. China came in and made a very big noise over the last couple of weeks that they wanted addressing three big issues. They felt correctly, in my view, and most people's view, they have not gotten a fair share of the power and the representation at the International Monetary Fund, at the World Bank, at the various international organizations, given that it's the world's third-largest economy and second-most-populous nation.

And there was a lot of blather, Hallmark card, about - as you put it - about we're going to relook at governance. But they didn't do anything to really give the Chinese or the Brazilians or the rest of emerging markets new voice. The second thing the Chinese raised to a lot of news in the last couple of weeks was various threatening noises about, well, we really are a little worried that the U.S. is being spendthrift. The dollar is going to go through the floor. All these U.S. Treasury bills we own are not going to be worth very much. Why are we doing this?

And I always felt that fear was exaggerated, but it was underlying - underlining a real Chinese concern, which is they want greater exchange rate stability in the world. They don't want to have to worry about the dollar going up and down, Euro going up and down. There's absolutely no mention, at least on my ray of the communique, of anything about exchange rates unless I missed it and certainly wasn't prominent. The third thing, which the Chinese got a tiny bit on, is they're very worried about getting up against trade protectionism. Because, of course, their whole economy is built on exporting a lot to places like the U.S. Until...

LAURA CONAWAY, BYLINE: There is a lot in the communique about that - trade protectionism.

POSEN: Yes, there is - unfortunately is more of the Hallmark-card language. There is a wee bit of something better in two statements. There's a statement that the WTO, the World Trade Organization, is going to do some naming and shaming of people who do put up new protections. And there was a statement about we're not going to engage in financial protectionism through our fiscal policies, meaning stuff like the Buy America product. The problem is, what they really needed was a statement, we're going to name and shame and avoid bad protectionist measures, even if they're not officially illegal, according to the WTO. Because there's all kinds of stuff countries have undertaken like our Buy America clause, like export subsidies these subsidies in India, like French preferences for French-made cars that, strictly speaking, are illegal but are a real protection. And they didn't really address that.

CONAWAY: Why would China agree to sign on to a communique out of which it gets so little?

POSEN: It's a very good question. I mean, the good way to look at it is, you know, a lot of these countries come there because they do realize there's a global crisis. And even if there is not something in it specifically for them, it's good for the world and they want to be part of it. So Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Russia, you know, a number of other countries, India, were at the meeting and didn't get things that necessarily were their agenda, either and still signed on.

But it is striking and it is an interesting question, especially since the Chinese so upped the rhetoric in recent weeks, why suddenly now they didn't seem to get much traction in the actual negotiating discussion process? I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing, both for long-term, systemic reasons, it would be better to give China more voice, and also because a couple of things they were advocating weren't so bad. But presumably, you know, nobody forced the Chinese Premier or anything. So presumably he - this - he made the decision that things were OK.

CONAWAY: You mentioned the first time we talked, Adam, that part of the fun of being at one of these is the inside baseball and who ends up breaking off and talking to whom. Any inside baseball to take note of here?

POSEN: Well, the inside baseball that got the biggest coverage was that the Canadian prime minister, for some reason, wasn't there when they wanted to do a group photo. And then when they finally retook the group photo, the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, was very intent on making sure he was absent so he could show off he was important, too. But the more interesting inside baseball will trickle out over the next couple days. I think one thing that comes out very clearly is that Angela Merkel from Germany is really playing her hand very well. She had Sarkozy making a lot of noise, but in the end, she got most of what she went into the meeting wanting, and without having to stomp out and without having to draw a lot of attention herself, even though she seemed to get a lot of face time with Queen Elizabeth in the footage I saw. The other thing that's interesting, in terms of inside baseball, is I don't know if it's Obama's charm or what, but the people who had bilaterals with Obama, including, importantly, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev, seem to have come away quite mollified. And...

CONAWAY: I think it's those iPods he's handing out.

POSEN: Is that it? I mean, again, that sort of underlines what a lousy gift he gave Gordon Brown last month. But, you know, if he can export Apple that way, so much the better.

CONAWAY: All right. So if you met with President Obama, you walked away a little bit happier than when you walked in, it seemed.

POSEN: Yeah. And what's interesting is it doesn't seem to be just star power. I mean, again, to their credit, they seem to have gotten good reactions out of people, you know, agreements to have future summits. More importantly, from people like, say, the Russians - implicit agreement. They weren't going to make a lot of obstreperous noise at this conference. So that's pretty good.

DAVIDSON: You know, Alex, it's - before this whole crisis started, my job was, as you know, international business and economics correspondent for NPR, which meant I was covering what I thought of as this very slow-moving story, like a generational story, something that would happen over decades, which is China and India and Brazil becoming much more powerful forces, maybe Russia, as well, and beginning to challenge U.S. power. Although, I think the U.S, obviously, will remain the dominant economy for a long time to come. And this crisis, it sort of puts all that out of your head because there's so much acute stuff. And I find it fascinating that we're now - we're sort of seeing this fast-moving crisis rubbing up against this longer, kind of, maybe generation-long competition, you know, sort of all together in one meeting. It's...

BLUMBERG: Yeah. And it also seems like the crisis is actually maybe accelerating this generational story that you were seeing and maybe making it happen - maybe it's going to be half a generation now or...

DAVIDSON: Right. Right. Happening much faster.

BLUMBERG: You know, our economy has gotten smaller, and China's economy is continuing to grow. Right? I mean...

DAVIDSON: And it's much harder for our stance in these things to be that not only are we the richest country, but we're the country that actually knows how to do financial markets. We're flawless, and you're a moron...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Which is, I think, how a lot of administrations have dealt with the rest of the world.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: That's a harder argument to make these days.

BLUMBERG: It also is just fascinating hearing, like, the story about Berlusconi sort of staging his walkout just to show that he was important. It's just sort of like - you just think to yourself, really?

DAVIDSON: Really, yeah.

BLUMBERG: Like, this is - these are the people who are in charge of the direction of the world in the coming, you know, decade, that, like, they're going to be - have these petty tirades about whether or not they're in the picture or not.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, I guess it's just Canada and Italy, though. We can...

BLUMBERG: Right, exactly.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Everybody knows they're insecure nations anyway.

DAVIDSON: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: Well, one of the big things that came out of the G20, as we mentioned, was that at the same time that the world was agreeing that we need to strengthen and tighten financial regulation, our very own Financial Accounting Standards Board here in the United States, which is the group that sets the accounting rules for all domestic companies and banks and financial institutions, said - sort of did the opposite, or at least that's what a lot of people are saying.

DAVIDSON: Right. I mean, this is this mark-to-market. You keep hearing mark-to-market in the news. We have done this to death. Go listen to our bad banks show, which goes into it. And we've done it on the podcast a million times. But basically, there's been this tension between those who say if a bank owns an asset, it has to tell us what the value of that asset is in the open marketplace. And that's the only way we know for sure we know how much the bank is worth because banks lie.

They - if we don't force them to tell us an objective price, they're going to lie and say the thing is worth more than it is. And we're not going to know how sick the bank really is. The banks say that's ridiculous. These assets aren't selling because the economic crisis, and this stupid mark-to-market rule is forcing us to say something that isn't true on the downside, that - forcing us to put way too little value. And that's why these banks are in so much trouble. So it is kind of fascinating that we are - there is an argument that the global economic crisis is based on an accounting rule, specifically Statement 157 - I'm holding it in my hand - of the Financial Accounting Standards Board code.

BLUMBERG: Which deals with this issue, mark-to-market, which you just...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...Described. And basically, what happened was, yesterday the rule got changed. And people in favor of the rule change said, that's great. We've - it's made it easier for banks not to mark things to market, not to use the price that this would have to be sold...

DAVIDSON: In this sick economy, yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...In this sick economy. They're saying it's ridiculous that we would have to - right now we couldn't get what it's actually worth selling it because nobody has any money. Everybody's broke. The markets are dysfunctional, so we shouldn't have to carry it at that value on our books. Other people are saying, no. That's the worst thing you possibly could have done. Now, banks - it's making it basically easier for them to lie.

And there's one other little wrinkle here, which I find really interesting. One other I talked to a guy who's an accounting professor who's actually in favor of this rule. And basically, it sort of depends on who you're talking to. You've got - if you're talking to a bunch of, like, community and regional banks and they're saying to you, listen, accounting professor, we are getting hammered here.

We didn't create this problem. We didn't create these CDOs. And we're just like a community bank. And we bought a mortgage-backed security from a very safe place, from Fannie and Freddie. And it's really safe, it's well underwritten. And now our regulator is making us write down, even though it's still performing, even though we're still getting returns. And so, you know, you hear that enough, and you think this mark-to-market rule needs to be changed.

DAVIDSON: It's killing healthy banks.

BLUMBERG: It's killing healthy banks. But then if - on the other side, if you're, like, an equity analyst or somebody who's, like, looking at these big banks and you're, like, I can't figure out what's going on in the big banks. I feel like they've been lying to me. I feel like they're going to continue to lie to me. This rule really gets you upset because it, seemingly, makes it easier now for the banks to lie.

Because they can just sort of say, oh, it's a dysfunctional market. The security that I'm claiming is, you know, is worth $0.70 on the dollar. I'm going to continue to claim it's worth $0.70 or maybe I mean, make it $0.85 now, because I'm going to use my, quote-unquote, "model" instead of the market.

DAVIDSON: So can't we just have a law that good people get to avoid mark-to-market and bad people have to follow mark-to-market?

BLUMBERG: Right. Exactly. Well, and so this is the interesting thing. I talked to a professor, a guy named Joshua Ronen, who's a professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at NYU. And he said, you know, he said that it's killing community banks. But he worries because mark-to-market cuts both ways. In the - in a boom time, like we had before...

BLUMBERG: It might...

DAVIDSON: ...In 2006.

BLUMBERG: ...Be priced at a bubble level.

DAVIDSON: It's a - priced at a bubble level.

BLUMBERG: And unsustainable, high level.

DAVIDSON: Which, of course, the banks love. And so now the - because of the way this rule was changed, the banks will be able to use the bubble prices in the bubble years. But then when it's bad - when it's downturn, they're going to be able to say, oh, it's a dysfunctional market and we have to use our model.

BLUMBERG: Well, I'm not going to take a firm stand, but anything that allows banks to invest way more during a bubble and then hide their losses during a downtime, that sounds like a good thing to me.

DAVIDSON: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: All right. So now mark-to-market - I hate it whenever we have to talk about it, because it's so abstract and kind of obscure - but I hope, I hope, I hope, maybe this podcast, plus our Bad Banks show plus 50 other things we've done are helping you understand it. Please let us know if we're working or not. But it is connected to the real world.

DAVIDSON: Yes. And in fact, real homes and apartments and real neighborhoods. And in fact, a listener that we heard from, listener named Amy Ennis (ph). She checked in with our very own Laura Conaway, from Clover, S.C., the other day.

BLUMBERG: And we should say that South Carolina is currently suffering the second highest unemployment rate in the country - it's 11%. That's really bad. And - but Amy and her husband bought their place in a new subdivision back in 2007.

DAVIDSON: At the height of the real estate bubble.

AMY ENNIS: When we first moved in, I had extra comfort in it, because the builder of the neighborhood, the developer, his mom lives in the neighborhood. And I thought, well, that's a good sign. So we got a house here. And since the bottom's fallen out of the market, they stopped building in phase three. And so all winter we looked at clay lots because the soil here is basically red clay, but it had all the wiring for - the lots were ready to go.

You know, cable company had come in, the phone company had come in and laid all the wiring. So they're all set to go. And just recently, about a week or so ago, the developer, his name is Johnny (ph), he came in and covered it all up - seeded it all. And I told my husband, I said, I guess he's not planning to build for some time. And so I'm just - I'm waiting and seeing. But it's been since last fall was the last time he built a house.

CONAWAY: Now, when you say he came in and seeded it, do you mean for grass?

ENNIS: Yeah. He seeded the lots. He seeded the lots, so he's going to have to come in and mow them. I mean, that's what's crazy. But he had to seed them, I guess just - I guess he was worried about problems with erosion. And he definitely, obviously, doesn't think he's going to be building anytime soon.

CONAWAY: So that said to you, this thing is on hold.

ENNIS: Exactly. And it's - my neighborhood is on hold.

CONAWAY: Do you worry about your house value going down if you're sitting in a half-built subdivision?

ENNIS: Yes. I told my husband that I'm afraid it will lose half its value before this is all over with. And I have a very doom-and-gloom outlook, I know. But I really think that what we paid for this house was way to - and just in hindsight as being a little kid and growing up in Charlotte and knowing what my parents paid for our houses, this house isn't really worth what we paid for it.

DAVIDSON: So Amy Ennis sent us a picture of this neighborhood. I was trying to picture it, but now you - we can actually just see it. And we're going to put that on our blog at npr.org/money.

BLUMBERG: You know, and Adam, this is, like, sort of it - actually her little postcard from her neighborhood in South Carolina, like, gets to a little bit at the heart of the problem with mark-to-market. Because Amy is exactly the thing that banks and bank regulators are trying to figure out. She has a mortgage, probably with a bank. It sounds like she's intent on keeping paying her mortgage. She hasn't lost her job or anything.

But if you were a bank regulator looking at her situation on paper, she's living in a half-built subdivision where homes have lost half their value, it would seem prudent to suppose that maybe she is more likely to default. In other words, her mortgage is riskier than it was. In other words, you have to reduce the price. So it's tricky.

DAVIDSON: It's very tricky. And that's why we here at PLANET MONEY promise you absolutely no answers some days. Just - we're just going to help give you a fuller picture of the confusion.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, exactly. We have to explain to you why you are confused. Exactly.

DAVIDSON: And to justify, hey, if you're confused, it's not like some guy knows everything that's happening and you just are out of the secret. Yeah. Anyway, thank you so much for listening. Please visit npr.org/money. Send us emails at planetmoney@npr.org.

BLUMBERG: I'm Alex Blumberg.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson.

Our priority is putting people first, the middle-class families that have been affected
for the last two years, and really making sure that they receive whatever full assistance

So we're doing this around the clock.
We're not going to stop, and we're not going to let these numbers deter us.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.

Welcome to our world.
Exactly.
It is a big issue because the- The future of the world depends on it.
It's not even a stretch to say that.
There's a little rule that was changed that has to do with mark-to-market accounting,

To lie.
Exactly.
So we're going to talk about that, but also on today's show, we have just a
little something about the G20 Summit, another mysterious thing.
You hear this phrase in the news, the G20 Summit.
It sure sounds important, but what's going on there?
And we have a lovely listener postcard from a half-built subdivision.
But first, Alex, the Planet Money Indicator, 663,000.
That is the number of jobs that were lost last month.
Again, millions of jobs were created in the U.S. last month.
Millions more were eliminated.
The difference between the jobs created and lost is that number, negative 663,000.
Not good.

There's so much nice language in there that our own Laura Conaway called up
our good friend economist Adam Posen with the Peterson Institute.
He was there at the meeting.
Although he's American, he was advising the UK on its agenda.
And Laura asked him why it sounded like a Hallmark card, how nicely this thing
was written.
Everybody was getting along.
And Adam Posen said, well, there was one big player who stands to be
unhappy, China.
It's very hard to see what China got out of this.
China came in and made a very big noise over the last couple of weeks that
they wanted addressing three big issues.
They felt, correctly in my view, in most people's view, they have not gotten a
fair share of the power and the representation at the International

organizations, given that this is the world's third largest economy and
second most populous nation.
And there was a lot of blather, Hallmark card, as you put it, about,
we're going to relook at governance, but they didn't do anything to really give
the Chinese or the Brazilians or the rest of emerging markets new voice.
The second thing the Chinese raised to a lot of news in the last couple
weeks was various threatening noises about, well, we really are a little
worried that the US is being spent or if the dollar is going to go
through the floor.
All these US Treasury bills we own are not going to be worth very much.
Why are we doing this?
And I always felt that fear was exaggerated, but it was underlining a
real Chinese concern, which is they want greater exchange rates to
build in the world.
They don't want to have to worry about the dollar going up and down,
euro going up and down.
And there's absolutely no mention, at least on my reading, they
communicate anything about exchange rates unless I missed it.
It certainly wasn't prominent.
The third thing which the Chinese got a tiny bit on is they are very
worried about getting up against trade protectionism because, of course,
their whole economy is built on exporting a lot to places like the US.
There is a lot in the communique about that, trade protectionism.
Yes, there is.
Unfortunately, it is more of the hallmark card language.
There is a wee bit of something better in two statements.

It's a very good question.

But it is striking, and it is an interesting question, especially
since the Chinese sew up the rhetoric in the recent weeks, why suddenly
now they didn't seem to get much traction in the actual negotiating
discussion process.
I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing, both for long-term
systemic reasons it would be better to give China more voice,
and also because a couple of things they were advocating weren't
so bad.
But presumably, nobody forced the Chinese premiere or anything.
So presumably, he made the decision that things were okay.
You mentioned the first time we talked, Adam, that part of the
fun of being at one of these is the inside baseball and who ends
up breaking off and talking to whom.
Any inside baseball to take note of here?
Well, the inside baseball that got the biggest coverage was that
the Canadian prime minister for some reason wasn't there when they
wanted to do a group photo.
And then when they finally retook the group photo, the Italian
prime minister, Sergio Berlusconi, was very intent on making
sure he was absent so he could show off he was important too.
But the more interesting inside baseball will trickle out over
the next couple of days.
I think one thing that comes out very clearly is that Angela
Merkel from Germany is really playing her hand very well.
She had Sarkozy making a lot of noise, but in the end, she got
most of what she went into the meeting wanting and without
having to stomp out, without having to draw a lot of
attention herself, even though she seemed to get a lot of
FaceTime with Queen Elizabeth in the footage I saw.
The other thing that's interesting in terms of
inside baseball is I don't know if it's Obama's charm or
what, but the people who had bilaterals with Obama,
including, importantly, the Russian Prime Minister Medvedev,
seemed to have come away quite mollified.
I think it's those iPods he's handing out.
Is that it?
I mean, again, that sort of underlines what a lousy gift
he gave Gordon Brown last month, but if he can export
Apple that way, so much the better.
All right, so if you met with President Obama, you
walked away a little bit happier than when you walked
in, it seemed.
Yeah, and what's interesting is it doesn't seem to be
just star power.
I mean, again, to their credit, they seem to have
gotten good reactions out of people, you know,
agreements to have future summits, more importantly,
from people like, say, the Russians.
Implicit agreement.
They weren't going to make a lot of obstruperous
noise at this conference.
So that's pretty good.
You know, Alex, before this whole crisis started,
my job was, as you know, international business and
economics correspondent for NPR, which meant I was
covering what I thought of as this very slow moving
story, like a generational story, something that
would happen over decades, which is China and
India and Brazil becoming much more powerful
forces, maybe Russia as well, and beginning to
challenge U.S.
power, although I think the U.S.
obviously will remain the dominant economy for a
long time to come.
And this crisis, it sort of puts all that out of
your head because there's so much acute stuff.
And I find it fascinating that we're now sort of
seeing this fast moving crisis rubbing up against
this longer kind of maybe generation long
competition, you know, sort of all together in one
meeting.
Yeah.
And it also seems like the crisis is actually
maybe accelerating this this this generational
story that you were seeing and maybe making it
happen.
Maybe it's going to be half a generation now.
Right. Right.
Happening much faster.
Our economy has gotten smaller and China's
economy is continuing to grow.
Right.
And it's much harder for our stance in these
things to be that not only are we the richest
country, but we're the country that actually
knows how to do financial markets.
We're flawless.
And you're a moron, which is, I think, how a
lot of administrations have dealt with the
rest of the world.
Right.
That's a harder argument to make these
days.
It also is just fascinating hearing like
the story about Berlusconi sort of staging
his walkout just to show that he was
important.
It's just sort of like you just think
yourself really like this is that these are
the people who are in charge of the
direction of the world in the coming decade
that like they're going to be have these
petty tirades about whether or not they're
in the picture.
Yeah.
I guess it's just Canada and Italy that
we can.
Right.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Everybody knows they're insecure nations
anyway.
Exactly.
Well, one of the big things that came out
of the G20 as we mentioned was that at
the same time that the world was agreeing
that we need to strengthen and tighten
financial regulation, our very own
Financial Accounting Standards Board here
in the United States, which is the group
that sets the accounting rules for all
domestic companies and banks and
financial institutions, said sort of did
the opposite.
Or at least that's what a lot of
people are saying.
Right.
I mean, this is this mark to market.
You keep hearing mark to market in the
news.
We've done this to death.
Go listen to our bad banks show, which
goes into it.
And we've done it on the podcast a
million times.
But basically, there's been this tension
between those who say if a bank
owns an asset, it has to tell us
what the value of that asset is in the
open marketplace.
And that's the only way we know for
sure.
We know how much the bank is worth
because banks lie.
They if we don't force them to tell
us an objective price, they're going
to lie and say the thing's worth
more than it is.
And we're not going to know how sick
the bank really is.
The banks say that's ridiculous.
These assets aren't selling because
the economic crisis and this
stupid mark to market rule is forcing
us to to say something that isn't
true on the downside, that forcing
us to put way too little value.
And that's why these banks are in
so much trouble.
So it is kind of fascinating
that we are there is
an argument that the global
economic crisis is based
on an accounting rule,
specifically statement one fifty
seven. I'm holding it in my hand
of the financial accounting standards
board code, which deals
with this issue mark to market, which
you described.
And basically what happened was
yesterday the rule got changed
and people people in favor
of the rule change said that's great.
We've it's made it easier for
banks not to mark things
to market, not to
use the price
that this would be a sick economy
and a sick economy.
They're saying it's ridiculous that
we would have to right now.
We couldn't get what it's actually
worth selling it because nobody has
any money. Everybody's broke.
The markets are dysfunctional.
So we shouldn't have to carry
it at that value on our books.
Other people are saying, no, that's
the worst thing you possibly could
have done. Now banks, it's making
it basically easier for them
to lie.
And there's one other little
wrinkle here, which I find really
interesting.
One other I talk to a guy
who's an accounting professor
is actually in favor of this
rule.
And basically it sort of depends
on who you're talking to.
You've got if you're talking to a
bunch of like community
and regional banks and they're
saying to you, listen,
accounting professor, we
are getting hammered here.
We didn't create this problem.
We didn't create these C.D.O.s
and we're just like a community
bank. And we bought a mortgage
back security from a very safe
place from Fannie and Freddie.
And it's really safe.
It's well underwritten.
And now our regulator is making
us write down even though it's
still performing, even though
we're still getting returns.
And so, you
know, you hear that enough and
you think this mark to market
rule needs to be changed.
It's killing healthy, killing
healthy banks.
But then on the other side, if
you're like an equity analyst
or somebody who's like looking
at these big banks and you're
like, I can't figure out what's
going on in the big banks.
I feel like they've been lying
to me. I feel like they're going
to continue to lie to me.
This rule really gets you
upset because it seemingly
makes it easier now for the
banks to lie because they can
just sort of say, oh, it's a
dysfunctional market.
The security that I'm claiming
is, you know, is worth
70 cents on the dollar.
I'm going to continue to claim
it's worth 70 cents or maybe
I'm going to make it 85 cents
now because I'm going to use
my quote unquote model
instead of the market.
So can't we just have a law
that good people
get to avoid
market to market and bad people
have to follow market to market?
Right. Exactly.
Well, and so this is the
interesting thing. I talked to a
professor, a guy named Joshua
Ronan, who's a professor of
accounting at the Stern School
of Business at NYU.
And he said, you know, he
said that it's killing
community banks.
But he worries because
market to market cuts both
ways in a
boom time like we had before.
It might be priced at a bubble
level, an unsustainable
high level, which, of course,
the banks love.
And so now the
because of the way this rule
was changed, the banks
will be able to use the bubble
prices in the bubble years.
But then when it's when it's
downturn, they're going to be
able to say, oh, it's a
dysfunctional market
and we have to use our model.
Well, I'm not going to take a
firm stand, but anything that
allows banks to invest
way more during a bubble
and then hide their losses
during a downtime.
That sounds like a good thing
to me.
Exactly.
All right. So, um, now,
market to market.
I hate it whenever we have to
talk about it because it's so
abstract and kind of obscure.
But I hope I hope I hope maybe
this podcast plus our
bedbanks show plus 50 other
things we've done are helping
you understand it.
Please let us know if we're
working or not.
But it is connected
to the real world.
Yes. And in fact, real
homes and apartments and real
neighborhoods and in fact, a
listener that we heard from
a listener named Amy Ennis.
She checked in with our very
own Laura Conway from Clover,
South Carolina the other day.
And we should say that
South Carolina is currently
suffering the second highest
unemployment rate in the
country.
It's 11 percent.
That's a that's really bad.
And but Amy and her husband
bought their place in a new
subdivision back
in 2007 at
the height of the real estate
poll.
When we first moved in,
I had extra comfort in it
because the builder of
the neighborhood, the
developer, his mom lives
in the neighborhood.
And I thought, well, that's a
good sign.
So we got a house here.
And since the bottom's
fallen out of the market,
they stopped building in phase
three.
And so all winter,
we looked at clay lots
because the soil here is
basically red clay.
But it had all the wiring
for the lots were ready to
go. You know, cable company
had come in, the phone company
had come in and laid all the
wiring. So they're all set
to go.
And just recently, about
a week or so ago, the
developer, his name's Johnny,
he came in and
covered it all up, seeded
it all.
And I told my husband, I
said, I guess he's not
planning to build for
some time.
And and
so I'm just I'm waiting and
seeing.
But it's been since last
fall was the last time he
built a house.
Now, when you say he came
in and seeded it, do you
mean for grass?
Yeah, he seeded the lots.
He seeded the lot.
So he's going to have to come
in and mow them.
I mean, that's what's crazy.
But he had to seed them.
I guess just I guess
he was worried about
problems with erosion.
And he definitely obviously
doesn't think he's going to
be building any time soon.
So that said to you, this
thing is on hold.
Exactly.
And it's my neighborhood
is on hold.
Do you worry about your
house value going down if
you're sitting in a half
built subdivision?
Yes, I told my husband
that I'm afraid it
will lose half its value
before this is all over with.
And I have a very doom
and gloom outlook, I know.
But I really think
that that what we paid
for this house is weight.
It just in hindsight
as being a little kid
and growing up in Charlotte
and knowing what my parents
paid for our houses.
This house isn't really worth
what we paid for it.
So Amy, and it sent us
a picture of this
neighborhood.
I was trying to picture it,
but now we can actually just
see it.
And we're going to put that
on our blog at NPR dot
org slash money.
You know, and Adam, this is
actually her little postcard
from her neighborhood
in South Carolina,
it gets to a little bit
at the heart of the problem
with mark to market.
Because Amy is exactly
the thing that banks
and bank regulators
are trying to figure out.
She has a mortgage
probably with a bank.
It sounds like she's intent
on keeping paying her mortgage.
She hasn't lost her job
or anything.
But if you were a bank
regulator looking at her
situation on paper,
she's living in a half
built subdivision
where homes have lost
half their value.
It would seem prudent
to suppose that maybe
she is more likely to default.
In other words, her mortgage
is riskier than it was.
In other words,
you have to reduce the price.
So it's tricky.
It's it's very tricky.
And that's why we here
at Planet Money
promise you absolutely
no answers some days.
And just we're just going
to help give you
a fuller picture
of the confusion.
Exactly.
We have to explain to you
why you are confused.
Exactly.
And to justify, hey,
if you're confused,
it's not like some guy knows
everything that's happening
and you just are out
of the secret.
Yeah.

thank you so much
