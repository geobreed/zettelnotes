    I just listened to the April 24 podcast and thought I would write in to describe an example of the "denomination effect" I experienced yesterday.

    I went down to the local Big Apple gas station to buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's and noticed a sign taped to the counter asking customers to buy rolls of quarters. This gas station does a lot of business selling cigarettes, soda and cheap beer, High Gravity Lager in particular. It didn't register why they'd have so many quarters on hand, but the guy behind me, who was, in fact, about to buy three or four pints of High Gravity, immediately knew what it was, and commented about the economy, and how people are going through their couch cushions and such, scrounging up loose change for their day to day purchases.

    I bought a roll, just to have quarters stockpiled for laundry. I felt a little guilty handing the cashier a twenty, even though he thanked me profusely.

**faster whisper:**
Buyers are not going to want to have a drastic drop in resale value as soon as
they drive off the lot with the new vehicle so I believe that they will
avoid General Motors vehicles and Chrysler vehicles for that matter and
that the other water makers would benefit at the expense of General
Motors and Chrysler.
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm David Kestinbaum and for once I'm in the
same room with my co-host. That's right. Welcome to New York City, David. I'm
Laura Conaway. That was Dennis Virag, auto analyst and president of the
automotive consulting group you just heard at the top of the podcast.
Today is Monday, April 27th. We have lots of Planet Money indicators coming
out of Detroit. How about 21,000? That's the number of workers who will be laid
off in the coming months and David there's also four of course. As the
number of brands GM will kill off including Pontiac and Hummer. Or you
could get a Planet Money indicator from a lot farther off like 250
million dollars. That's a loan. Anybody? That is the loan the World Bank is
going to extend to Mexico to deal with the outbreak of swine flu. On
today's podcast we are later, I'm very excited about this, we are going
to unveil it's sort of like a Planet Money confessional booth for people
anyone out there who had some small role or maybe a larger role in the
financial crisis to get it all off their chest later. Yeah you don't have
to be amazingly famous but if your name happens to be Tim Geithner or
Alan Greenspan or something like that. We'll give you the number. Dude the
line is open that's coming up. First though we are going to take a
long look today on Planet Money at another industry in trouble not the
auto industry, the media. We're going to start with some news that for me is kind
of personal. If you're a journalist and especially any kind of financial
journalist, that's a pretty small circle, you can relate to this. This is
big. Even if you're not a journalist this is just one of those nightmare
tales. Alright here goes. Okay today Portfolio Magazine comes out and says
it's closing down. Now Portfolio Magazine has kind of been trying to
be like the New Yorker but for financial stuff. It looks great, it
reads great, it's a ton of fun. Yeah a whole suite of blogs, really nice
writing, we really like it. And it's just it's beautiful but the Condé Nast
publication did not catch on with readers or advertisers. It turned two
years old this month. It's headquartered just up the street from us in
Manhattan. I always see their black limos out front when I ride home on
my bike. It used to be located there. They called the staff together this
morning and told them the magazine is shutting down. So our regular
listeners of the show will remember Felix Salmon. He was a blogger for
Portfolio. You don't have to cry for Felix Salmon, no you don't. No because
Felix he left in March to go blog for Reuters so he's okay but of course
they hired somebody to fill his desk. Yeah his replacement is named Ryan
Avent and he had been writing a blog for The Economist which is one
of the great great places you can ever be. It was called, it still is
called Free Exchange. It's The Economist's big blog. Ryan Avent started at
Portfolio on April 15th which we'll just calculate that for you at home
not even two weeks ago. That is not even long enough to go downstairs you
know and get your new business cards made. Ryan says he was actually still
getting congratulatory emails about his new job. And he was kind enough
to talk to us today about what it's like to leave one of the most
prestigious shops in journalism for a cool opportunity at a place that you
know closes down. As far as I can tell it was a surprise to everyone at
Portfolio. I don't think they were stringing me along. They were
taking it back by the news as I was. Well you know I got to give it to you
on timing there Ryan. I know it's a real kick in the head. You know I
understood that this was definitely a possibility. I didn't think that
it would be a possibility so soon. I thought things really had to sort of get
worse for the economy as a whole for them to to get to this position. But
you know the good side is that if there's a good side is that you know
there's an ongoing need for or demand for people writing about economics and
finance issues. And you know Portfolio was a great stage. It would have been
nice if it had lasted a little longer. But I can't feel too bad about having
a chance to to get a little more exposure and maybe something will come
along soon. Man you know sometimes you just land at the wrong place at the
wrong time. Advertising and Portfolio apparently fell 60% from the first
quarter of this year compared to the same quarter last year. Which is
really not good news. But I got to say one thing about Ryan Avent and he
says it himself. He has got plenty of company all across the media.
Newspapers have been reporting record falls and paid circulation. Newspaper
jobs are evaporating from Miami to Seattle, Hartford Connecticut, San Diego,
California, every place. Newsrooms are half the size they were just a decade
ago. And in some cases half the size they were just a few years ago. So we
have in the studio sitting right next to us here is NPR's media
correspondent David Falkenfleck. Hey. Hey guys. Hey. So you are a former
newspaper guy at the shop where my wife is still a reporter, the Baltimore
Sun. A couple blocks from my house. You know my dad worked for the
Inquirer for decades. And man you know newspaper folk they used to be like the
most fun to hang out with when I was a kid. In addition to having pneumatic
tubes there at the office. They were just really great stories to tell.
And now when you go and hang out with newspaper people you know it is
just it is really sad. Well you're not kidding. I mean you know like
did you hear the one about this year's Pulitzer winner in Arizona who
just been laid off by his newspaper. That's true story. So was the one about
the guy who's a reporter in the suburbs of St. Louis who took a bullet while
covering a city council meeting last year. He lost his job too. And so did
the blogger for the Chicago Tribune who wrote on dealing with the
recession every day. He was just laid off and not allowed to blog about it.
So David it's really clearly not a very pitying kind of industry. I've
been kicked out of it myself two or three times print newspapering. Lately
though I've been reading constantly people different bloggers different
people on their Twitter feeds trying to come up with a new way for newspapers to
survive. And you David I know spent a lot of time with us last week talking
to people in and around the business who think they have some kind of a
path out of the wilderness. So you could just go ahead and lay that right
on us. Well let's take one moment and think about the wilderness. I mean
we all know that newspapers have been hammered by losing paying
subscribers as reading habits have changed. You know there's TV the
internet the iPod the Wii the Xbox basically pretty much anything and
everything with a the in front of it. And when people stop paying the Beatles
advertisers don't want to pay as much to advertise and some don't want to pay
at all. That's the you know the so-called structural problem with
newspapers. I mean like this the structure itself is wrong. Yeah it's a
problem you know classifieds have gone online to Craigslist and
meanwhile there's this cyclical problem where advertisers are just
disappearing. The recession. The recession. Business cycle. Exactly. So a
structural problem we think about like the business model like the way
they get money isn't isn't going to cover the cost anymore and cyclical is
just like the economy's down right now. So I mean you know when I think
in like one thing you don't always think about is you think of stores
closing but they're also mergers right. In Baltimore the paper used to
get you know multiple full page ads from department stores but Hecht's one
of the department stores became part of Macy's. So now you just get one
classified ad you know and that there's less competition so there's
less lead need for those places to advertise. It can just be devastating.
Right and consolidation among cell phone companies and among cable
companies among airlines. That's been a real hit for papers. And
meanwhile people are migrating online to read where advertisers don't pay
nearly as much to reach them and where readers with very few exceptions
aren't really paying to read. So one of the people I've talked to in
recent days is Steve Brill. Now Steve Brill is a really really famous
person. I actually caught a glimpse of him once when I went to apply
for a job at his old magazine which is now gone. Steven Brill's
content right. Yep. Yep. I saw him back there and I thought that's
Steve Brill for sure. I was just sitting in the in the waiting room.
His baseball card goes something like this. Journalist entrepreneur
founder of the American Lawyer newspaper and court TV. He's also
the founder of a private firm called Verified Identity Pass. It
uses biometrics like a retinal scan of your eyeball to whisk people
through those TSA checkpoints at the airports. Yeah. He's a
fascinating and brilliant guy. That's exactly the Steve Brill here.
He's he's partnered with a couple of folks who include the former
publisher The Wall Street Journal and they've announced this venture
called Journalism Online LLC that Brill says may set things straight
by forcing people to pay for what news they read online. And here's
part of what Brill told me when we talked recently.
It's an attempt to bring the business model for journalism back to
what it always has been, which is readers pay a share of it and
advertisers pay a share of it, except of course for NPR. And what's
happened over over the last several years is that newspaper
publishers and magazine publishers have been engaged in in
group suicide, where they all decided for reasons that I can't
figure out that they were going to give their stuff away for free
online at the same time that they sell it on newsstands, which
makes no sense. And they're now seeing the consequences of it
combined with obviously the consequences of, you know, the
overall economy.
Now, Brill says that newspapers would have to take a plunge
pretty much together, that and that each would have to figure
out some pricing system, whether to charge pennies per article
or, you know, a couple bucks for each month of access, or
just for stories about your favorite baseball team or your
senators or whatever.
I mean, I sort of think of this as being like the sort of like
the iTunes model, right? I mean, it used to be that music was
available for free everywhere. And the artists were like,
how are we ever going to get paid? And then, you know,
people, they set up these services where you can pay a
small amount of money. And it's small enough that people
are like, Yeah, you know, that that's fine. And I'll feel
good about myself. And I'll, I'll do it right and pay for
the song.
Well, this is the idea. And it's funny that you mentioned
iTunes because he's inspired by that he says he thinks
this really will work as long as it was just that quick.
And we think we've come up with a simple, at least simple for
the consumer solution to do this. I mean, the reason that
iTunes works is because it's relatively inexpensive, but
most important because it's simple. So you know, my three
kids have gone from being pirates of music to kids who
buy it. Because Steve Jobs made it really easy to buy it.
So obviously, there could be some antitrust issues if people
perceive the newspapers to be acting in concert, but Brill
has some pretty major legal firepower behind him. And he
says, if the producers of serious news take that news
away from people, they'll really notice what they're
missing.
I mean, this has sort of been tried in the past,
right? That New York Times tried putting its most
famous writers that you've ever in thought, you know,
somebody can't live without columnist like Maureen Dowd
and Thomas Friedman. They put him behind a wall, you're
supposed to pay if you wanted to read them. But that didn't
work. They even put the crossword puzzle, which you
think like, forget it, man, people will pay for the
crossword puzzle. That didn't work. You know, you're
saying they charge for clues or something.
Right.
So haven't we tried this?
Have we tried this?
Well, look, it's worked in certain specific areas, like
some smaller papers that don't have immediate regional
competitors have made it work. The Idaho Falls Post
Register is one of those. The Wall Street Journal seems to
have held on to and even slightly increased its paid
circulation by having paid online subscription form.
And you got to remember, though, people see the
journal as the definitive financial news outlet in the
country. People value that. It's kind of tough to make
people pay for news stories on the web. As a general
rule, though, if you think the Rocky Mountain News in
Denver was shut down earlier this year by its owners,
and a group of the papers journalists combined to
create an online site with three local entrepreneurs
called In Denver Times. They said, hey, we'll stay in
business if we can get 50,000 paid subscribers by late
April. They got 3000.
Wow.
So I asked Jay Hamilton what he thought of the model of
Brill's Journalism Online LLC. Hamilton is the
director of the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media and
Democracy at Duke University, who studies media
economics. And Hamilton says Brill's plan overlooks a
pretty central problem about what people are willing to
pay for.
The things that help you do your job, stuff that helps
you find a product, things that are just fun to know,
like information about celebrities, that's going to
be there. But there is this gap between what people
need to know and what they want to know. The set of
boring stories about city councils or agencies, that
accountability journalism that created the sense of
somebody is watching what you're doing if you're in
government. That has always been subsidized in some
ways.
Hang on a second. Can I just jump in here for a second?
This isn't, David, one of the things people talk about
working is, is the story about your city council
because it's local and your newspaper isn't going to
cover it as closely as you might like.
You know, you can do it if you got a big splashy
expose. But if you're going to have the humdrum of
everyday just being there to make sure people aren't
getting away with something in a story that doesn't
yield kind of salacious results, I don't know that
people are going to be paying for that so much.
But that's the whole thing with New York Times
rolling out their local blogs and saying we're going
to we're going to blog neighborhood by
neighborhood. We're going to we're going to bring
the web down to micro level.
So far you haven't seen the Times saying and
we're going to charge the people of Queens to
read it. They're saying we're going to offer it.
The other problem is that if a local paper is
out there doing the daily stories and then
something big happens because they've been
following every stuff, everything day to day. You
know, what happens is some other aggregator site
is going to grab the story, slap a headline on
it and people go to them.
That's exactly right. And what Jay Hamilton says is
that you can almost always get a replacement
that's at least good enough.
So in his case, he reads the Washington Post
daily online. But if the Post started charging
for content that way, he says he'd just
substitute Politico dot com.
And he also was very careful to warn against
the comparison with iTunes.
And he talked a bit about that.
Unless that information is
is very special.
It's going to be hard to charge for in
part because unlike the music
industry, you can't copyright
facts. You can copyright songs
and your favorite performer may not
have good substitutes and
you like to listen to a song over and over
again. So charging for
music works because the property rights
are different and your demand for
the information is different.
Charging for news
doesn't work if there are other many other
people competing for your attention and
willing to offer it to
you. So Jay Hamilton is not actually hostile
to Brill in that he says someone has to
come up with a solution or else we'll be
running a huge experiment.
In his words, to see how big can
corruption and waste grow to be at the
local level when newspapers just go away.
His solution, and it's not the only
voice you hear saying this, is to suggest
kind of a public radio model in
which people could contribute money to a
not for profit arm of the New York Times
or the Boston Globe or whatever paper to
help sustain its reporting.
I mean, it's sort of like the BBC is that
way, right? It's supported by tax dollars.
Well, the BBC is supported by a mandated
extraction that's levied on any person
in Great Britain who owns
a TV. And it's astonishing how resentful
people are of the way they monitor it.
But it is treated as a sort of public
good, you know what I mean?
Absolutely. There's a real value put on
that. We're not going to start taxing
everybody who has a doorstep for
having the ability to have a newspaper
lab. I don't think that would go over
well here. The doorstep tax as
proposed by Laura Conway.
There you go. You heard it here first,
right here. All right.
But you believe, David, that there's
one thing that gets mentioned only in
passing most of the time.
I've heard you talk about it.
It's not the structural problems
for newspapers where they have to
change their business model.
And it's not this incredible
economy with the recession knocking
out ad dollars, because despite
this kind of ghoulish parade
of headlines we get, most
newspapers are actually making at
least some money right now.
Well, right. I mean, it's the
thing that's perhaps most familiar
to the listeners of Planet Money's
podcasts, and that's debt.
Needless gratuitous debt is driving
some once great newspapers into
the ground.
The Tribune Company, my old
employer, which owns the L.A. Times,
Chicago Tribune, the Baltimore Sun
and some other solid papers,
is in bankruptcy protection.
Sam Zell took over the company less
than two years ago in a deal that
saddled it with 13 billion
dollars of debt.
And that's particularly jarring because
he put down only three hundred and
fifteen million dollars in his own
money to do it.
But there are plenty of other
examples, too.
You think of the parent companies
of the Minneapolis Star Tribune and
the Philadelphia Inquirer.
They're both operating under
bankruptcy protection.
The McClatchy Company, which is the
owner of the Miami Herald and the
Sacramento Bee and twenty eight
other papers, has been warned by
the New York Stock Exchange that
it's about to be delisted
because it's on such shaky
financial ground due to debt.
See, I think that's really
interesting because we're always
hearing that the media
newspapers are a particular case
with particular problems.
But what you're telling us is
that it's the same familiar
refrain with current owners.
They borrowed too much money.
The credit was easy.
And they've been gutting their
papers to sort of prop up profits
and cover those debt payments.
And it sounds like it really has
very little to do with journalism
and news and storytelling
and problems with the financial
model, the structural problems,
as you say.
So is there any way
in which this is going to turn
out to be good news?
Are we going to have newspapers?
Well, there's no way to say this
is good news, and it doesn't
reflect on the people running,
you know, our supposed
journalistic watchdogs here.
I guess there's a sliver of hope
in the sense that not all
of the problems are endemic
to the news business per se.
A lot of the problems have been
brought on by, you know,
the way in which corporate
chiefs did business,
which is not to dismiss
the very real structural
and cyclical problems
we talked about before.
But a lot of this has nothing
to do with the news business.
So if they can figure out a way
to get past that or bankruptcy
protection helps them get through,
it may not be quite as bleak
as it looks at the moment.
All right.
Thank you, David Folkenflick,
for the first good news
I've heard about the media,
really, in quite a while.
It's been great having you
around the blog all last week.
A lot of fun.
All right, folks, that just about
does it for us today.
But we have one small piece of
let's go ahead and we'll
call this business.
I'm not sure it's business,
but it involves you,
the Planet Money listener,
David Kestenbaum,
you and Hannah Joffe Walt
cooked up this idea.
Let's roll it.
So, David, you know, I'm a Jew.
Yeah.
And maybe that wasn't obvious,
but I always kind
of wished I was a Catholic
only because I really
I love the idea of
going to confessional.
It's like you go into
this little room
and you just let it all go.
Yeah, I know I can see that.
So, David, I'm going
to tell you something.
OK, I'm in a confessional
booth right now.
Really?
Yeah, I have heavy
velvet curtain up all around me
and it's dark,
but in this really nice way,
really relaxing,
you know, reflective.
Management approved
the purchase of velvet curtains.
You know, David,
use your imagination, man.
It's radio.
You can't see me.
Just picture it.
OK, you said
you were in a confessional.
I'm in a confessional.
All right, Caitlin,
can we get a little organ here?
Great.
Nice.
Yeah.
So I'm in a confessional
and I'm thinking about,
you know, what people
think about in confessional
the economy and how
it's all my fault.
And, you know, this is something
we talk about a lot
on the show, David, where
on this mad search
to find people to blame
for all of you listening.
And we are going to find
you some real villains.
But for the most part,
people keep telling us that
we're all kind of to blame,
which I have to say is
is pretty unsatisfying.
Right.
Yeah, it is.
But it doesn't have to be.
Step into the booth, David.
Just think about it.
How are we all to blame
for landing us in this crisis?
I mean,
I thought it'd be kind of interesting,
you know, if we keep hearing
that we need to blame everyone,
all of us.
If all of you out there
are you really feeling that
maybe you're thinking about
ways in which you are to blame
and not for everything, of course,
but in some small way
for all to blame.
What was your part?
Tell it to the priest.
Oh, right, the priest.
This is why you don't get a Jew
to set up your confessional.
All right, kill the organ.
Whatever the images you prefer,
maybe confessional
isn't your thing
or maybe you always wish
you could be in a confessional.
We'd just like to hear from you.
What what part did you
play in the crisis?
So, David, we set up a phone line
for people to call us
and apologize
for causing the financial crisis.
And I thought you could call it.
Me?
Yeah, you.
You think you're exempt
from the we're all to blame thing?
I don't know.
We need a model.
We need listeners
need to hear someone do it here.
Just hear how it will sound.
OK, ready?
I'm dialing.
Hi, this is Adam Davidson.
You've reached the planet
money apology line.
If you're a government official,
press one.
If you work for a large
money center bank, press two.
No, I'm just kidding.
That's not how we're doing it.
This line is for anyone
who wants to own up
to some small part
of the economic crisis,
or if you want to own up
to some big part of the cause
of the economic crisis.
Please also give us your name
and a way to contact you.
And also, if you're
leaving a message here
and you don't explicitly
tell us not to,
we may use the recording
on the podcast, on the radio
or in, you know, in other ways.
But you can tell us not to
and then we won't.
Thank you very much.
Hi, this is David Kastenbaum.
I'm a reporter with Planet Money
and I'm sorry.
As a journalist,
I guess I should have seen
the housing crisis coming.
I did not see the
housing crisis coming.
I'm really, really sorry.
I wasn't covering economics,
but I'm but I'm sorry anyway.
And I'm going to do my best
to find what the next
crisis might be.
And we will do our best
to report that to you.
That is my pledge.
Also, I guess I didn't
short the housing market,
which I could have done.
And I could be more patient
and I finished the milk
in the fridge.
And if I think of anything else,
I'll call back.
OK, bye.
That was great, David.
All right.
All of you out there,
it's your turn.
And don't just copy David's.
You can't all be guilty
for being journalists.
So how did you get us here?
The number to call is 202-371-1775.
I'm going to say it again.
202-371-1775.
And we will, of course,
post that number on our blog,
NPR.org slash money.
We'll be checking that line,
Planet Money people,
and waiting for your true confessions.
I'll even toss a few of them
onto the blog,
maybe at NPR.org slash money.
All right then,
I'm David Kastenbaum
and I'm Laura Conaway.
Thanks for listening.
