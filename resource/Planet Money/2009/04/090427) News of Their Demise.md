    I just listened to the April 24 podcast and thought I would write in to describe an example of the "denomination effect" I experienced yesterday.

    I went down to the local Big Apple gas station to buy a pint of Ben & Jerry's and noticed a sign taped to the counter asking customers to buy rolls of quarters. This gas station does a lot of business selling cigarettes, soda and cheap beer, High Gravity Lager in particular. It didn't register why they'd have so many quarters on hand, but the guy behind me, who was, in fact, about to buy three or four pints of High Gravity, immediately knew what it was, and commented about the economy, and how people are going through their couch cushions and such, scrounging up loose change for their day to day purchases.

    I bought a roll, just to have quarters stockpiled for laundry. I felt a little guilty handing the cashier a twenty, even though he thanked me profusely.
