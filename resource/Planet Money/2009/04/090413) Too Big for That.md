A couple of bigs from the Minnesota Federal Reserve wrote a book five years ahead of its time. Gary Stern and Ron Feldman's Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts hit the world in 2004. It's getting more relevant by the day. Plus: Enron's mark-to-market scandal and a look at the Nantucket classifieds.

Now Weil tells you why he thinks banks should have to stick with the system now.

-- Everything you want to know about a community, you can find out from its newspaper — especially its classified ads. Bob Barsanti, a teacher, has been tracking the ads on Nantucket island with his classes. If you're looking to rent, he says, you're in luck.

-- A couple of execs from the Minnesota Federal Reserve wrote a book five years ahead of its time. Gary Stern and Ron Feldman's Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts hit the world in 2004. It's growing more relevant by the day.
