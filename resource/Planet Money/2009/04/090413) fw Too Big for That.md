A couple of bigs from the Minnesota Federal Reserve wrote a book five years ahead of its time. Gary Stern and Ron Feldman's Too Big to Fail: The Hazards of Bank Bailouts hit the world in 2004. It's getting more relevant by the day. Plus: Enron's mark-to-market scandal and a look at the Nantucket classifieds.

On today's Planet Money:

-- The last time we talked about mark-to-market accounting, a whole bunch of you wrote back, "Enron." And you were right. Bloomberg columnist and former WSJ reporter Jonathan Weil reported in 2000 on how Enron used market-to-market to create mammoth earnings. Now Weil tells you why he thinks banks should have to stick with the system now.

-- Everything you want to know about a community, you can find out from its newspaper — especially its classified ads. Bob Barsanti, a teacher, has been tracking the ads on Nantucket island with his classes. If you're looking to rent, he says, you're in luck.

**faster whisper:**
For us, this $165 million, it's so nothing.
The entire financial system of the United States
is being subsidized by taxpayers.
Now, I'm going to say, that might be the right thing to do.
I'm not a populist.
I'm not saying that's horrible.
But I think it's politically really, really dangerous.
I shoot my head up tight.
I make my plans at night.
And I don't sleep.
I don't sleep.
I don't sleep till it's light.
So those throats, I'ma bury alive.
There is an awful sound that's pounding me down.
And it will not, it will not, it will not just be quiet.
Hello, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm David Kastenbaum.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
This is Monday, April 13.
And that was Adam Davidson and Alex Bloomberg,
you just heard, at the top of the podcast.
They were on Meet the Press this weekend.
Hey, David, did you do your taxes yet?
I did.
I filed electronically.
I kind of miss the days when people
used to file by paper.
Have you ever gone to, like, the post office?
Yeah, it's like a whole parade down there.
Yeah, and there's someone outside.
It used to actually be one of my favorite things to do
is to get on my scooter, my kick scooter,
and ride down to Borough Hall here in Brooklyn
and just drop them off.
This is my midnight run.
On today's show, we are going to take a second look,
I can't believe this, at the fascinating rule
of accounting called mark-to-market.
We're also going to talk about this whole idea
of too big to fail.
And we're going to hear from a lot of people
who are interested in this.
And we're going to hear from a lot of people
who are interested in this.
And we're going to hear from a listener
who's living in this kind of cool, closed economy.
But first, the planet money indicator.
It's $77 billion.
Yep, that is the total amount,
according to the New York Times story this morning,
that the U.S. government might have to kick in
if it pushes General Motors into bankruptcy.
Just to be clear, David,
this $77 billion to General Motors,
we're talking about loans, right?
So you think bankruptcy makes a lot of sense.
This is great.
We're going to renegotiate with the workers.
It'll sell off Hummer and the brands that aren't working.
And the company gets to start clean.
But the truth about bankruptcy is that
in order for GM just to keep operating in bankruptcy,
it needs something called dip financing,
which we've talked about on this program before.
But it's basically a loan just to keep everything going
until the company is profitable again.
The details weren't spelled out in that story,
but it looks like that role
is going to fall to the U.S. government.
So if you're one of the people out there
who's thinking good bankruptcy,
now the government doesn't have to bail out
the auto manufacturers anymore?
Well, this bankruptcy is actually going to require
more money from the government.
They're in for $13.4 billion with GM so far.
And the bankruptcy could require a way larger loan
of up to $77 billion.
According to that story.
So we'll see what happens there.
A few podcasts back we did a segment
about mark-to-market accounting, right?
Yeah, it's this rule that so many banks
have been complaining about.
Why don't you explain it, actually?
The rule is actually called fair value accounting.
And it says that wherever possible,
if you're a bank and you have
some mortgage-backed security,
when you write down what that's worth,
you have to go look out in the market
and see what it's selling for.
You have to use the market price.
You have to mark it down at the market price.
That's what it says, whenever possible.
Yeah, except that the banks these days
are holding a lot of things that aren't trading.
They've got these assets that literally
just about nobody wants to buy.
And they've been saying that they need
a lot more flexibility
because there is no market.
If they had to put a value on them
right now, some of these assets,
the number would be zero.
So this is why the Financial
Accounting Standings Board, FASB,
remember that FASB,
decided to cut banks some slack this month
and FASB offered clarification
explaining in more detail
the terms that govern when
you as a bank have to use mark-to-market
and when you don't.
And the change is generally interpreted
as giving the banks extra slack.
So the banks were happy with it.
But no sooner did we explain this
than several listeners pointed out
that the last time they'd heard
of mark-to-market accounting
before this crisis
was back in the 1990s
with a little energy company called Enron.
Yeah, and you guys are absolutely
right out there, especially my friend
Jack, who went and dug up this whole thing
about Enron and mark-to-market
accounting. Enron used
mark-to-market accounting to create these
enormous values
for energy contracts.
Last week I sat down with
an investigative reporter who wrote one of the
very first articles.
It was so exciting to me. He wrote it back in 2000.
He was one of the very first people
to look at what Enron was doing and say
there's something about this little accounting rule
no one's talking about mark-to-market.
The reporter's name is Jonathan Weil.
At the time he was working at the Wall Street Journal
and he says somebody just called him up
and tipped him off that Enron was
using mark-to-market accounting
quite creatively to make its money.
The FASB at that time basically
let Enron and the industry
write the accounting rules so that they could
take energy contracts
or electricity contracts, which had never
been before treated like financial instruments
and treat them like financial instruments.
And that's important because
we want to let them recognize
immediate upfront
profits on their
earnings statements.
Can we give an example of that?
So let's say that I'm Enron and I go
sell a 25-year
electricity contract to some
company, or to say
the state of California, which
the buyer wants to lock in
their prices for the future.
Enron locks in
basically a customer for the next 25 years.
And instead of recognizing
now if you look at these contracts
they're not very freely traded.
So there's no market that you
can really go to, except possibly
for Enron Online at that
point in time, which was a website that Enron operated
where they basically created
these markets and quoted the prices.
But even there you might not have
an active quoted
price that you can rely on to figure
out what is the value of this contract.
So what they'll do then is they'll
say, well, to figure out the value of
the contract we'll estimate what our
profits are for the next 25
years and take some
discount rate to reflect
the present value of future
earnings. And then we'll just basically
book the present value of
all that future income today
to the extent that, you know, reflected
profit. They would record
that as earnings.
And then the stock market would look at that and say
ooh, you should trade at 80 times
earnings, your stock. And this is
the incentive. And then from that 80 times
earnings for the stock, which presumably
their stock was going
gangbusters for the time, the
CEO and the CFO would all claim
bonuses as a percentage
of these phantom earnings that they had
created out of their mark-to-market
profits. So we're talking here about
a complete fiction that was made
possible by mark-to-market accounting.
Mark-to-market accounting
works great
when you've got good marks
and when you can actually have reasonable
reflections of what market values
are. And nobody
in the financial industry
or in the energy industry back then seems
to ever object to mark-to-market
gains
when things are going well.
What they object to
are when you have mark-to-market losses.
And you have to use the same
powers of estimation
to figure out what certain assets
or liabilities are worth. And then
if you're going to be honest about those
estimates, what they don't like
is when they turn into losses.
So Laura, it's interesting because
everyone now, you hear a lot from accountants
saying, no, no, we need to keep mark-to-market in place.
We need to have mark-to-market accounting.
And yet there was an example where even
with that in place, a company was able
to figure out a way to
manipulate it to their advantage.
To really famously get the best
of it, at least until several of them went to jail.
Now, Wild works now as a
financial columnist for Bloomberg
and so he gets to troll around
inside opinion, I think fairly
freely. So I asked for
his opinion on the change in
mark-to-market this month and
I just ask him straight up. Is it
good or bad that the Financial
Accounting Standards Board is cutting
some slack on mark-to-market accounting?
It's horrific because what it tells
you is that
A, the board is
basically given into political
pressure so that now there will
be
this coloring of any
decisions they ever reach in the future.
So you don't know if they're making
policies for how
companies should recognize earnings and assets
and the like. You don't know
if it's the accountants talking
or if you don't know if it's the government
talking and the bankers talking
using the accountants lips.
They let Congress intimidate them
into passing these new rules
that said that
if you have
losses on
certain types of securities,
you can delay recognizing them on your
income statement
effectively, indefinitely.
Now look, there is a
counterargument here when it comes
to the banks in a current situation
and I'll just make
it. I'm going to put my banker hat on here
and the argument goes that, look, when there is
no market, when really the stuff is
not trading except when someone is really
forced to sell it, then the market just is not
working. It is broken. I mean, imagine
walking into the floor of
a stock exchange and you say, walk into
the trading pit and you say, hey, I want to sell this
but the trading pit is empty.
There's no one screaming, no waving of hands.
You're the only person there and one guy looks over
to you and says, alright, I'll give you a buck for it.
The argument is that is a broken
market. It is not giving a fair value.
So I as a bank say,
look, this thing I'm selling,
no one wants to buy it, but there are houses
inside this mortgage backed security and there are people
paying their mortgages and even if no
investor ever wants to buy this thing
from me, I don't care. If I just hold
onto it, I am going to get more money
back than the one dollar that guy
is offering me right now. So the banks say
why should we have to mark this to
market? In fact, the accounting
rules acknowledge this. They say
if a market isn't working, you don't
have to use the mark to market value.
So we just want the appropriate
flexibility about when we can
do this. We want it to be clear. We want
the accounting standards board to make
that clear. And by the way, look, we have
auditors looking over our shoulder. They are
really tough folks. You know, they don't
let us get away with anything. Yeah, David, David Banker, David
Kestenbaum here. Okay, I'll come back. Here's
the problem. Jonathan Weil
says that those auditors
haven't been so reliable. They weren't
reliable during Enron and he's
saying that neither the auditors nor really a whole
bunch of other people are very reliable right now.
If everybody
did their fair values
on their assets and liabilities
fairly, we wouldn't have a problem.
But human beings being what they are
and particularly in years
when really large
fair value gains can result in
large fair values of bonuses,
then the incentive
is to constantly be putting
your thumb on the scales.
If you don't have checks and balances
around the system, if the companies
don't have control
over the people who are making
the estimates and the regulators are never going to do
anything and the auditors just take
their fees and never enforce anything,
then things get crazy.
David, one more thing from Jonathan
Weil, which I thought was just an interesting way to
put it. He says that we're using
accounting rules almost like
an economic development policy right now.
You mean something that you can kind of
tweak and see how it works until you get the right result?
Exactly. Just going for the best
that you can get basically.
And I'm going to link to his column on the blog.
He's a really good read over there at Bloomberg.
It's npr.org slash money.
And you know, on the blog
we have been asking people out there
for months to go ahead and check in with us
about how you're seeing the economy,
how you're seeing it for the good, how you're seeing it for the bad.
Today we're going to get the view
from a place I've never been but absolutely
should go probably starting tomorrow,
Nantucket. And we're going to get that
little help from our own Caitlin Kinney.
Hey Caitlin. Hey guys. We got a letter
from a listener named Bob Barsanti.
He's a teacher in Massachusetts.
He lives on Nantucket Island primarily
but he's working in the Berkshires right now
so he goes to the island for weekends
and during the summer.
But he's been a resident of Nantucket for about
23 years now so he's truly a local
and he knows the place really well.
He says that the best way to find out
what's going on in the island is to look at the classifieds.
Like pick up the newspaper at the coffee shop?
Right, like where they advertise
jobs and cars and that kind of stuff
and Bob says when he was younger, his grandfather
used to say, there's a ton of news in the
newspaper, it's not just all in the articles.
So he thinks it's a great way
to figure out what's going on. He happened to mention
it to one of his classes a few years ago.
They took it on as a project.
Lately it's become a little bit of an obsession
but Bob says it's really the best
place to look. They don't have a craigslist
on Nantucket and they've only got one paper
so if you want to know
you should look at the classifieds.
The classifieds are
going really weird.
One of the things that's going on
is that normally right
around now everyone on Nantucket
is hiring. They're hiring
landscapers, they're hiring waitresses
they're hiring counter help.
No one's doing that.
Normally right now
the classified ad has
40 or so in the paper.
In 2005 they had
74 ads.
This year there are 8.
Another thing that the
classifieds show is year round rentals.
When I first
came to Nantucket in the late 80s
year round rentals were rumors.
You'd hear
somebody says they're looking to put somebody
in an apartment for
the year and everyone would run to that
place.
But now they're everywhere.
Again, 2005
there were
8 in the paper.
Now in 2009
there's 25.
Caitlin, what's a house go for on Nantucket?
Well the thing about these year round rentals
is that typically before
when we were in a boom time and people could afford
to spend the money, these are houses and apartments
that you could rent for about
$3,000 a week in the summer.
It's almost what I pay in Brooklyn of course.
They could fetch huge huge bucks
but the thing is people can't afford to shell
so people who own these homes and
maybe perhaps have lost a job themselves
and are really kind of worried about money
are trying to rent them out year round
and just get the money whenever they can
and not try to demand those same high prices.
So you're happy to have anything in January
versus maybe not so much in August?
Right, any help you can get.
And Bob says there's a lot of numbers you can look at
the number of houses, number of jobs
but also for him these kind of things
have certainly started to hit home.
A good friend of mine is a baker
and he's a natural
and he's 45, 46 years old
he's got kids off island in school
he hasn't worked in this bakery
for 15 years
until this year
and he basically let off half his crew
and spent the time baking
all winter.
The other stories to come up is
a whole bunch of contractors
who don't have anything to do
and these are top level finished car contractors
these are guys who get their work
woodworking today
this old house and everybody does that
and suddenly they're available
for can you fix my front porch?
Sure, absolutely.
So they're taking work whenever they can?
They're taking whatever work they can find.
So there's a lot of people
on island who are doing the Yankee
thing and saying oh yeah
we're fine, oh yeah we're fine
but all the way around
looking a little more closely
there's a lot of economizing
and there are a lot of people looking around saying
how long do I stay?
When do I leave? When do I move off?
Ah, that stiff upper lip
I'm from Connecticut, I know it very well.
Bob sent us some pictures of Nantucket
and of the classifieds
you can check them out on our blog
NPR.org slash money.
Finally today
we have an interview for you
with the authors of
I call this a very very
important book.
It is ranked number
117,584
on Amazon.
It describes
part of the very crisis we are in
now and the title of this
mega seller is
too big to fail, the hazards of
bank bailouts.
And I know you out there are thinking wow
somebody got their act together
and they wrote a very quick book to
capitalize on the crisis.
It's an instant book kind of thing.
Yeah, but here's the punch line
the book was written in 2004
before any of this happened.
And you, David Kestenbaum, have interviewed the authors.
I did. They are Gary Stern
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
and Ron Feldman who's also
at the Minneapolis Fed and they were in town
for a talk at the Brookings Institution
and I started by asking Ron
you've been warning about banks
getting too big to fail and how the government
had to step in and it would be a real mess.
How did it feel when you saw this
actually happening?
Certainly I told you so
did run through my mind.
So Gary the question was
do you have any specific recollection
of what it felt like?
When your awful predictions became
true.
Well
it's funny my feelings about that
have evolved over
time. I mean
first I asked myself so is this really
kind of a too big to fail problem
there's something else going on here.
I think I became more and more convinced
that at least part of it was a
too big to fail problem and then
so then I obviously got concerned
that you know some of the preparation
and so forth that we had advocated hadn't been
taken and then
I got as I said in my remarks
I started to feel well at least now
people do understand what we were talking about
and there's some hope
for action going forward
but obviously the jury is still out
and we'll have to see
how this all plays out
and I think the most important thing right now
obviously is we get through
the crisis and then hopefully
we'll get very serious about
taking some of the actions we've been proposing
so we don't experience this again or at least
reduce the probability of experiencing
this again. Can you be specific
about how some of the ideas you're proposing
might have stopped this from happening
there would have, AIG would have been
forced to break up
or banks would have been required
to keep more capital around in case
of bad times. What specifically might
have happened?
I mean I think in some cases it relates
to let's say the organizational structure
of the institutions involved
they were organized a certain way
they have overseas operations
that makes it very hard for us to figure out what to do
and therefore the only real solution is bailout
we wouldn't have said you can't have
foreign subsidiaries but I think what we would have said is
well is there a way to allow the firm
to get the benefit of its structure
but without whatever specific details are occurring
that are preventing us from putting them through
the normal resolution framework.
Now I want to make you be specific because
I'm trying to be specific
so one thing we're hearing
is because of the way that they structured
their operations for example
the money kept in
London flows back to the United States
and it happens at a certain time and therefore it's difficult
to say we're going to do something in the United States
because it severs what happens in London
and it makes it difficult to figure out exactly how to resolve
the institution. I think it's a pretty specific
kind of case. The firms
were allowed to operate in that way
because people hadn't thought well if they
operate in this way and we want to do something
later we're going to run into a lot of trouble
so what we would have done
is we would have had
supervisors focused not just on their
current condition but what happens if this
institution gets in trouble. We think they would have
identified things like this kind of
interconnections between the US
operation and the foreign operation
and they would have I hope proposed specific
things that would allow them to both
benefit from having overseas operations
but without the technical difficulties that made it
difficult for them to be resolved.
It seems to me like some of the
problems were just that AIG had credit default swaps
and wasn't keeping enough money around in case they all
went bad. That's not out of the world.
I think the issue is that their counterparties
didn't have enough collateral. That's the problem
right? Apparently AIG
was a one-way rider of credit protection
so they never diversified.
That seems like that would be an odd
thing and I think if you were the person
who's in charge with thinking about
how does AIG get in trouble it strikes
me that that would be one question that you would ask yourself.
I think, again
I hope this doesn't sound too general but I think
right now we
don't have an entity, an oversight
entity, a government entity that thinks to itself
what happens if this institution gets into
trouble and is going to fail. What would
we do about it at that time?
The primary focus of most supervision
is to prevent them from getting into
trouble and I think it sounds like
a generic thing, well just you change your focus
but that's not trivial. That's important
because it's by focusing
on what we would do if they got in trouble that this stuff
gets revealed. One of the things you
talked about was, I don't think the right word is
self-destruct button, but you would like when
these companies get into trouble that there would be a way
for, it's like when a nuclear reactor
starts to overheat, you can scram it, you can put it
into safe mode or something. You would like
to have a way for these things to fail
gracefully. How would that
work? Well
if you're talking about a resolution
regime for non-bank, important
non-bank financial firms
I mean what you're trying to do is
two things. You want to have an orderly wind
down of the organization.
So you put it into receivership or conservatorship
you put
presumably some government
entity is in charge
and they begin the process of
selling off the assets
and selling off the liabilities
however that occurs. The really
hard decision is are you going to impose
losses on creditors and
if so which ones and by how much and so
forth. Now we've argued that that is
an important thing to do under the right circumstances
because that's how
you get market discipline going forward.
You don't want to do that in the middle
of a crisis. I guess
you're talking about doing something in advance to make that
easier. You could do it now it's just a mess
right? Well
what you want to do in advance is you want
to put the creditors on notice
that they may... People have loaned money
to this institution that's in trouble. Uninsured creditors
that's right. On notice that they may
indeed lose money
of some magnitude if
that institution gets into difficulty.
Shouldn't they know that already? That's the definition of it.
That's the problem with too big to fail.
They don't believe it and they don't
believe it because there's no mechanism
there's no credible mechanism in place
to make that happen. And the reason
you want to do that is not because
it's not equity or anything
you want them to
it all has to do with how risk gets
priced. If they believe that they
will indeed lose something
then their incentives are different than when
they believe they'll be fully protected.
And if they believe they will lose something
then risk will be priced more appropriately
and that sets up a potential
for a virtuous circle.
Which means that
creditors know the rule again. They price
risk differently. The institutions
confronts different prices in the market place
and will take on less risk. It sounds like you're basically
saying we're not going to do this again.
That's what you're going to make clear to them is that even though it happened now
we're not going to bail them out again. No, no, no.
That's not right at all.
If that's all you did. If you said we're not going to do this again
that's not credible. You have to take real
steps to make it credible.
That's what we're talking about.
The institutions that we won't do this again are silly.
You've got to take real steps
to make it
to reduce the probabilities
to reduce the probabilities of doing it again.
Do you think you're going to sell the movie rights for the book?
Only if I can find a buyer
and I must say they don't seem to be lined up.
And how did the cover
describe the cover to me?
It's a house of cards.
That's what it is.
The cover actually is of a house of cards
held together by Twine
and Paper Clips.
So that is Gary Stern, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
and Ron Feldman also at the Minneapolis Fed
and their book is now available in paperback.
I think that does it for us today.
We'll be back podcasting on Wednesday
when Hannah Jaffe-Walt is making noises
about doing something about what a billion
and a trillion dollars
looks like on the radio.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you.
