The recession's showing signs of up, but the credit crisis isn't over. Banks still aren't lending like they used to, to families or businesses. Ira Jersey, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets, can tell you why. Put simply, it's that families and businesses have borrowed too much already. They're continuing the long, slow and painful process of paying the debt down or writing it off.

On today's Planet Money:

The recession's showing signs of easing up, but the credit crisis isn't over. Banks still aren't lending like they used to, to families or businesses.

Ira Jersey, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets, can tell you part of the reason why. Put simply, it's that families and businesses have borrowed too much already. Now they're continuing the slow, painful process of paying the debt down or writing it off.

Bonus: The large cost of small amounts.

In response to our recent search for items costing 5 cents or less, Kevin writes from WMRA land:

    I work at a state university, and each month I get a long list of every toll calls made on my phone, including cost, and I have to sign that each was a work call or else reimburse them. This is an anachronism from when calls cost real money. Now, the cost is trivial. The most recent one I signed had 17 calls and totaled $1.70 and included four calls with a 4 cent charge.

    The most expensive call, 24 cents, was a 6 min. call from VA to NM. The cost to the university to print out these forms, distribute them to the staff, have the staff sign them and then for it to be recorded that they are signed (they redistribute them if they are not) must be way more than the total cost of the calls. It is nuts.

**faster whisper:**
I think you're going to see, what you're going to see first is growth turn positive.
And then you're going to see the pace of job losses slow materially further.
They've already slowed significantly, as you said.
They're going to slow materially further.
But again, most private forecasters, and let's use their judgment,
suggest you're going to see unemployment start to come down
maybe beginning of second half of next year.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington, D.C.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg in New York City.
Today is Monday, August 3rd.
And that was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner you heard at the top.
He was talking about ABCs this week.
Hey Dave, let's just start right off with the Planet Money indicator.
All right. It is 48.9.
48.9 what? Dollars? Kelvins?
I don't know what units it's in.
It is the Institute for Supply Management's factory gauge for July.
Right. So what is it?
Like Institute for Supply Management measuring units or something?
I just looked it up.
Apparently it's a percentage.
I don't know what a percentage of.
But it's basically a measure of how the manufacturing industry is doing.
So here on the website, non-metallic mineral products, paper products,
printing and related support activities, rubber products,
wood products, tobacco products, all that stuff.
Anyway, it is shrinking,
but the headline is that it is shrinking at its slowest pace in 11 months.
Yeah, anything under 50, any number under 50 means that it's shrinking.
Any number over 50 means that it's expanding.
But that 48.9, that is very close to 50.
So that's considered progress.
I feel like a lot of the indicators that we read are like that.
So today we are going to try and go back to something very basic
that's easier to interpret.
And we haven't done it in quite some time.
We're going to check in on the credit market.
So how easy is it for companies?
How easy is it for people to borrow money?
Right. And you may remember at the peak of the crisis
when people were talking about economic Armageddon,
it sounds like something you'd make a movie about,
until we tell you that economic Armageddon
means a seizing of the credit markets
where even good borrowers have trouble making money.
It's already, the poster isn't looking that action-packed anymore.
I mean, if you just think about it,
it doesn't sound like a total disaster.
Right, I know the dialogue.
Sir, bond spreads have widened by hundreds of basis points.
God help us all.
But it really was almost a catastrophe
because of this thing called credit.
Credit, as we've talked about over and over on this program,
is essential to the functioning of the economy.
If you can't borrow money,
if good borrowers cannot borrow money,
the economy sort of grinds to a halt.
Right, so it was like there was an asteroid
coming toward the Earth on a collision course, sort of.
It was an action movie.
Yeah, it was an action movie.
And you know in the action movies
you check in with the astronomer or the physicist
and they're like, yes, we've done the calculations.
We're heading right for us, we think.
Right.
So the guy who served that purpose for us
early on in this podcast was Ira Jersey.
And he studies the credit markets
and he's one of those guys who works in a room
filled with, I imagine, flat-screen TVs
and people running around screaming and shouting.
You talked to him about a year ago
and he did confirm that, yes,
we were in the path of an asteroid.
Yeah, so I called him back up now
to see how we were doing.
He's changed jobs.
He's now head of U.S. interest rate strategy
at RBC Capital Markets.
Can you hear me okay?
I can.
Okay.
You and I talked,
it was almost a year ago now.
It was September.
It was right at the peak of the crisis
or the beginning of the crisis or something.
And I was asking about the credit markets
and you said it was like a fire hose
that had been reduced to a trickle.
Sounds like me.
What's the flow like now?
Well, companies that weren't able to borrow at all
are now able to borrow.
But their rates might be higher.
So they might have to pay a higher interest rate now.
Correct.
So today they might have to pay a little bit higher
than they would expect to.
But at the same time,
they are able to get loans
and they are able to finance some debt.
But that's really only for good quality issuers.
A lot of lower quality issuers,
so what we call high-yield issuers,
are still having a problem.
But even in that market,
there are select deals getting done.
There are some, again, better quality issuers
in the high-yield market that are able to issue bonds.
So if I'm a riskier company,
I might have a harder time getting...
You'll have a harder time.
You'll have to pay higher interest rates
than you might have had to pay two or three years ago.
But at least you're able to refinance your debt.
And that's really what's been happening.
A lot of the debt that is getting done
and investment-grade corporate issuance,
good quality, generally larger companies,
have been able to issue bonds.
But that's really to repay bonds
that are coming due this year or early next year,
whereas there's not a lot of new bonds being created.
So these are really just a rollover of existing debt.
So things are not back to where they were before the crisis?
Nowhere near where they were before the crisis.
That being said,
they are nowhere near the crisis levels
that you saw in the third and fourth quarter of last year.
So Ira Jersey says we are away from the abyss,
but the credit crunch part of it is not over.
So everywhere you look, things are slow.
Banks are not lending significant sums,
in part because they're still worried about their own health.
And here, just to give one concrete example,
Baltimore, where I live,
they used to issue a certain kind of bond
called a TIF bond to finance new developments.
For instance, there's this project plan for downtown by the water.
And the market for those bonds just does not exist right now.
Baltimore can't sell them,
which is another way of saying
that no one wants to loan Baltimore money.
At least for this big project in downtown by the water
that these bonds are for.
Right, so actually the U.S. government has stepped in
and it's helping out.
It's providing backing for these things called recovery bonds.
But it turns out, in order to participate,
Baltimore had to declare itself, the whole city basically,
a disaster zone.
It's a recovery zone, I think.
So it is a disaster movie.
Yeah, it is a disaster movie, yeah.
Right, right.
And the problem, I guess what Ira Jersey is saying
and what we're talking about here,
the problem Baltimore is having,
consumers and other companies are having as well.
They can't borrow as much money as they used to.
And you talked to Ira Jersey about why that is.
And one reason that banks and other financial institutions
don't want to lend us and the companies that we run
and own money is that we've already borrowed too much.
The consumer, just the household,
debt levels are still very high.
In our estimation, households need to repay
about $3.5 trillion of debt
in order to get back to what we would consider
a more sustainable debt-to-income ratio.
And at current savings rates,
that will still take well over three years
in order for that to occur.
And then if you look at things like
debt-to-revenue ratios for non-financials,
for industrial corporations,
those levels are at the highest level
they have ever been as well.
So you have a situation where both the household
and the business sectors
have significant amounts of debt
compared to how much they make.
And until those levels come down,
we don't think that there'll be a significant addition
to debt of either, at least on a net basis.
So this is the great de-levering we were talking about.
It's still going on.
Correct.
And again, it's going to take two or three years
at a minimum, probably until it's over.
And it might even take longer than that.
So on the one hand, Alex,
that sounds like a good thing, right?
We're getting out of debt.
And Ira Jersey says, and many other people say,
that this de-leveraging process, it's necessary.
Right, but most of the big things that people buy,
like cars and houses and new equipment,
if you're a company,
it's bought with borrowed money.
And those big purchases obviously help the economy rebound.
And so it's sort of this weird bind.
The longer it takes for us to dig ourselves out of debt,
the slower the recovery will be.
We suspect that the economy will come out of the recession,
actually, in the near term.
Our worry is that we will have very slow growth
for a very long time.
So as opposed to a, quote unquote, normal recession,
so you look at the last two or three recessions
that we've had in this country,
and what you see is the year after a recession,
is you usually get pretty good growth.
You get three, four, five percent real GDP growth.
In this situation, we think it'll be much slower
and we'll be slow for a long period of time.
Now, the good thing is, is that at the end of the day,
so five years from now,
the household sector will be in much better financial shape.
People will be more confident,
and we think things can get better longer term,
but this great de-leveraging that has to occur
is going to be somewhat painful from a growth perspective.
And we're not sure that the market is kind of prepared
for real GDP growth to be, say, half or even less than that
of what most people have determined is potential growth,
so two and a half to three percent.
It might be half that for the next three to five years.
So, Dave, it seems like what Ira Jersey is saying
is two things.
First of all, the recovery,
it won't feel necessarily like a recovery.
To take that economist speak,
three, four, five percent growth,
what that means to the average person is that, you know,
the job market's going to rebound,
there are going to be lots of jobs, wages will go up,
and if we're having what he's saying is basically one percent growth,
that means it's basically just going to sort of bump along here
with, like, high unemployment,
and it's not going to feel like the recession's ended,
even if it technically has.
Yeah, it's not like you have the flu
and then you're better and back to work.
It's like you have mono or something, you know?
Right, exactly.
You were healthy, you went down,
and you stayed down for a long time.
You didn't bounce back.
Yeah.
Right.
So one of the things, though,
that people are also talking about
with this new administration especially
and with the recession,
the government is spending so much money,
and generally when that happens,
when the government spends a lot of money
that it doesn't have,
the government is not borrowing money and spending it,
people typically start to worry about inflation.
You talked to him about that as well, right?
Yeah, I mean, the concern is also the government's spending money,
so there's pressure if the government would be happy
if there were inflation down the road,
but also the Fed is trying to shove as much money
into the economy as possible.
So all that, the concern is that down the road,
that would lead to inflation.
So, you know, we may be talking about this
a lot over the next couple of years,
or we may not.
It turns out that the bond market,
which Ira Jersey studies,
can tell you what the market thinks about inflation,
and it's the sort of clever way.
There are these bonds
that you may have heard of called TIPS.
They're Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
but basically they're bonds
that protect you from inflation,
because if inflation goes up,
you get paid a little bit extra interest on them.
So they pay, say, 2%
plus whatever inflation turns out to be.
Right, so you can get a sense
for what the market thinks inflation will be
by looking at what people are willing to pay
for those bonds right now.
And that boils down to something called
the breakeven inflation rate.
So the breakeven inflation rate is effectively your,
is in effect the market's expectation
of what inflation will be,
will average over that period of time.
So for example, 10-year breakevens right now
are at 1.88%.
So what that's saying is that the market expects
on average over the next 10 years
for inflation to be 1.88%,
which historically speaking would be reasonably low.
So what that's saying is that
even though the government's doing
all this unprecedented stimulus spending,
even though the Federal Reserve is doing everything
it can to shove money out into the economy,
the market is still saying,
you know, over the next 10 years
we're not terribly worried about inflation.
Correct.
That is certainly what the market's telling you.
And I think that the market is probably correct.
Alex, so his argument is basically
that under normal circumstances,
all this extra money getting pushed into the economy,
that could be a problem.
But it's probably not going to be
because the credit markets are still kind of broken.
So even though we're putting all this money
out into the economy,
it's not having as big of an effect
as it might have at another time.
So he's saying basically it's not going to suck so much
when all the money has to come back out again.
Right. It's interesting.
Again, our movie does not have a very dramatic ending, huh?
No, I know. Exactly, exactly.
How will the Fed accomplish its quantitative easing goal?
Yeah, exactly.
Asteroids are a little bit easier to comprehend.
But not to stop all of you potential screenwriters out there
who are working on a big script about Ben Bernanke
and how he saved the world from financial Armageddon.
I could see Brad Pitt in that role.
Damn it, I said open the discount window.
Open it!
Anyway, I think that does it for us today.
