Doctors know plenty about you and your ailments, but what do you know about them?. Robert Krughoff, of Consumer Checkbook, has a new website, Patient Central, that uses detailed survey information obtained by actual patients to measure doctor performance. Sometimes a little bit of information can be too much. Naked Economist Charlie Wheelan says knowing our genetic makeup is good for us but bad for the insurance industry. Wheelan argues that as soon as our insurance pool is "corrupted" by this information, healthy people will begin to opt out and people likely to get sick forced to opt in at higher rates.

On today's Planet Money:

Information problems are some of the biggest hurdles in fixing health care. Doctors know plenty about you and your ailments, but you aren't usually given much information about them in return. Choosing your physician is an important decision, but how can you know if you are making a good choice? Robert Krughoff of Consumer Checkbook says he's got a new website, Patient Central, that makes finding a good doctor a whole lot easier. The website uses detailed survey information obtained by actual patients to measure doctor performance. One of the site's top rated docs, Dr. David Graham, says he likes the idea but thinks it isn't perfect.

Plus, a health care paradox. Sometimes you can have too much information. Naked Economist Charlie Wheelan says knowing our genetic makeup is good for us but bad for the insurance industry. Wheelan argues that as soon as our insurance pool is "corrupted" by this information, healthy people will begin to opt out and people likely to get sick will be forced to opt in at higher rates.

This letter comes to us from Melanie S., a nurse whose husband is a radiology resident:

    I take issue with your comparison of doctors to mechanics. On the
    surface this is pretty good. Both professions carry a skill set not
    many share. We have to put our trust in them that they are knowledgeable
    and competent. The bills are also similar. Little fees tacked on after
    the procedure. Frustrating. But by oversimplifying with such
    analogies, I think you run the risk of breeding resentment. The mechanic
    did not spend $250,000 dollars becoming educated and skilled. The
    mechanic did not work 80 hours a week in order to become competent. The
    mechanic doesn't work weekends, nights and holidays. You should do a
    podcast on the cost of training doctors.

    I nearly blew my stack when the idea of paying doctors based on their
    patients outcome was proposed. I have a better idea. Health insurance
    should be more like life insurance. Everyone is eligible but you will
    be charged for certain things. I believe everyone should qualify for
    health care and if you have a condition that was not created by the
    patient (type I diabetes, autoimmune disorders, genetic defects...) then
    you may pay bit more but you still have affordable insurance. If you
    suffer from poor health due to obesity, smoking, drug or alcohol abuse
    then you pay higher premiums. There needs to be more patient
    accountability for their own health. Until a doctor can admit an obese
    patient with heart disease into the hospital and control their diet and
    exercise for months until they lose weight then we can pay doctors based
    on outcomes. There is an idea for a podcast — how much does obesity,
    smoking, alcohol and drug abuse cost the system?

**faster whisper:**
Choice, competition, reducing costs, those are the things that I want to see accomplished
in this health reform bill.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington, D.C.
And I'm Chana Jaffewalt in New York.
Today is Friday, August 21st.
So Friday, maybe you're getting ready to go on vacation this weekend or maybe you're going
to spend your weekend reading economic papers on health care.
For the staff of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Friday just means another long
day of failure.
Yeah, another day of bank failure.
Yeah, so those guys work incredibly hard and especially on Fridays today, like almost
every other Friday this year, at least one bank will probably fail.
So the FDIC comes in, it takes over, it insures your deposits, and they do that out of something
called the insurance fund.
Right, and the insurance fund is a pool of money.
The FDIC collects fees from all their banks and they use that money to insure our deposits.
And David, back in when, April, we talked to the FDIC chief operating officer about
that insurance fund and at that time it was shrinking.
Today it is shrunk.
Yep.
Our indicator today is 13 billion.
That is the amount left in the fund.
When we talked to him back in April, the estimates were that it had 35 billion.
So from 35 billion down to 13 billion.
And just for comparison, a year ago it was almost 53 billion.
Right.
That is a huge difference.
So the FDIC does have a big line of credit with the Treasury.
If they need it, they're scrambling to find other ways of dealing with this.
What they normally do is they raise fees on banks, but they've done that already
a lot recently.
So they're also thinking about encouraging more financial institutions to take over failed
banks.
All right.
On to simpler things like healthcare.
Right.
By the end of this podcast, we will have that solved too.
David, why don't you start?
Okay.
So today we're going to be talking all about information.
And as we've mentioned, one major reason so much money is wasted in the healthcare
system is that there are all these information problems, what economists call information
problems.
So for a market to function well, you've got to have information.
In healthcare, there is asymmetric information.
We talked about that when we compared your doctor to a mechanic.
He or she has all the information and you as a patient don't have as much.
There's the problem that doctors themselves don't always know what drug or treatment
is best.
And then there's this information problem that to me, just as the clueless patient,
I'm particularly sympathetic to this one.
When you're choosing a doctor, it can be really hard because you move to a new
place and you don't know who's good and who's not good.
And what you really want is a book or for you youngins out there, a website where you
can go and look up and say, hmm, okay, Dr. Kestenbaum, he's very messy waiting room.
His patients say he has copies of People magazine that are three years old.
Oh, and he did surgery on this guy's right knee when the problem was really on his
left knee.
Oh my.
Yeah.
Interesting you say that, Hannah, because that website exists.
I did a story for Morning Edition last week and actually there was this phone
call I really wish that I'd made and we have that phone call for you today.
Anyway, the website was created by a group called Consumers Checkbook and the
organization was started by this guy, Robert Krugoff.
Well, I started Checkbook because I was driving away from an auto repair shop one
time.
And in fact, it was the third time I'd been there for the same repair.
And I was about a quarter of a mile away and I realized I'd be going back for
a fourth time.
So I thought, well, it'd be good if there was some way to find out which of the
good auto repair shops.
The car mechanics again.
Yeah.
So he fixed that information problem.
He was moving on to the next one and he wanted to rate doctors.
But this is hard to figure out how to do because I know you look one
doctor and the doctor's patients are sicker, but maybe they're sicker
because they're older.
It's just very hard to gauge.
But he thought, look, at least we can survey the patients.
That will tell you something.
You can ask, does your doctor listen well?
And when your doctor explains something to you, does he or she make sure you
understand?
Those are fair questions to ask.
So they tried to be very scientific about it.
They got lists of patients and doctors from insurance companies who were also
interested in finding out the results.
They randomly selected patients and they did a proper survey of patients
in a few urban areas.
So last month, they launched this website, which actually ranks doctors.
And Krugoff showed me the list for the Kansas City area.
So you can sort by overall rating.
And who's on the top of the list there?
For instance, this Dr. David Graham has a 96 overall rating.
And it says here that that is statistically significantly better than the average doctor
in the community.
Actually, it's way statistically significantly better.
And there are a lot of doctors up there in the 94, 96 range.
You had 100 people respond on Dr. David Graham.
That particular doctor was rated by 100 people in a confidential survey where we know those
people saw that doctor.
That doctor was rated by 100 people.
David, when you did this story on the radio, we didn't actually hear from this
top doctor.
No, I was most interested in the, you know, more awkward bottom of the list,
the worst ranked doctors and how they felt about it.
Because, you know, the question is, what is this really measuring?
Does the list show anything?
Is it useful information?
And it seems like it might.
The guy at the very bottom of the list had actually been disciplined for sexual misconduct
and distributing controlled substances on a gratuitous basis.
One doctor near the bottom called me back to say she thought the survey results for
her were misleading.
But anyway, an editor here at NPR said to me, look, you should call that guy at
the top of the list.
So I did.
Hi, Dr. Graham.
Yes.
Hello.
So David, I'm guessing the guy at the top of the list thinks surveys are a great
idea, best idea ever.
He was actually pretty measured.
I'll say he does seem popular.
The woman who answered the phone when I called his office, she said, oh, he's just this
wonderful, wonderful man.
And he told me that he hasn't been able to fit in any new patients for several
years.
What's it like if I walk into your office?
I mean, what do you try and do differently or well?
I think I try to do the best job I can for each person I see.
I enjoy seeing people and enjoy catching up with them.
And I, until 10 years ago, delivered babies as part of my practice.
So it's really a treat to see those children grow up and become young adults and go
on to have families themselves.
And one of the joys of family practice is that opportunity to know extended families
and see everybody from great grandma down to the babies.
So it's a rewarding way to practice.
What do you think about this idea of surveying patients about their doctors?
Well, I guess I'm biased, I guess.
It seems like a pretty good idea.
I guess if I hadn't scored so well, I might have a different opinion on the subject.
I think that feedback is valuable.
I mean, there are a lot of things that this doesn't measure.
Like, I mean, you could be misdiagnosing everything, right?
And your patients might still say, he's a great doctor, he listens, he's very
personable.
I don't disagree with you.
I have had family members in the past who have seen physicians that they thought
the world of, that I didn't think as highly of as they did.
Yeah, so surveys don't capture everything.
I actually saw an example of this when I was in San Diego this week.
Where was it?
So I was there following these cardiologists around.
And I, you know, I was with this one guy in particular, and just spending a day
with him, he had six operations in one day.
And he's putting stents in people's arteries.
It's incredibly hard.
You need a lot of skill to do this.
And especially some of the procedures he was doing that morning were very
complicated.
So he finishes one procedure and he rushes out of the room to tell the
family the woman's okay before he needs to run to his next procedure.
And this family, they cry and they hug him.
And he says, yeah, so she'll just need to stay overnight and tomorrow she'll.
And they go, wait, doctor, we're here for our father, not this lady.
Honey, you emailed me about this and I thought this was something that had
happened to the doctor like years and years ago, like a story.
No, it happened while I was there.
And he said it happens quite often.
He's busy and he's moving around and he's doing this very hard work.
I was thinking about it with this rating stuff because this family may not
have rated this doctor very well, even though the work that he was doing was
really skilled and he did a good job of it.
And their father was, by the way, okay.
You know, Hanna, this is why I don't try to pick a doctor.
When I need medical advice, I just call your mom.
Right?
Does she tell you to take a bath?
Is that what she advises?
That's her favorite thing.
That is her information problem.
She thinks a bath fixes everything.
All right, so usually more information is good for a market.
It helps things function more efficiently.
But now we have this really interesting story about how more information can
actually be incredibly disruptive.
Hanna, are you online there?
I am.
All right, go to this website, 23andme.com.
So this is a genetic testing website.
You spit in a test tube and send the test tube in, and they do these
genetic tests and they can tell you whether you are predisposed to having
Parkinson's disease.
Oh, wow.
Celiac disease, Crohn's disease.
Breast cancer.
Type 1 diabetes.
Yeah, yeah, there's a whole list.
So this is known.
It's a seemingly straightforward thing, but it has potentially huge
consequences for the entire economic structure of our health care system.
So imagine you're the insurance company, right?
You would love to have access to this information so that you could
charge people more appropriate premiums.
You know, if one person is likely to get sick, we charge you a little more.
If not, then we charge you a little less.
And that, of course, raises ethical issues, right?
So imagine two brand new babies.
They just breathe their first gulp of air.
You're going to charge one more than the other just because she has bad genes.
Right.
So I mean, there is a fix for that, though, right?
You could just pass a law saying, hey, insurance companies, you can't
discriminate based on genetic information.
But it turns out that still does not solve the problem.
So I talked to this guy, the naked economist, about this.
His name is Charlie Whelan.
He's the author of a book called The Naked Economist Undressing the
Dismal Science.
And he says that even if you ban insurance companies from using this
information, even if you fix that problem, you've still got another that
there is basically no way around.
We have a different problem.
Somebody still has access to the information, and it's you.
And, of course, you can glean information about your likelihood of
getting sick.
You can take a home DNA test, which is now available.
You can go to a private clinic or spa.
You can cut an arrangement with your doctor, in which case you test
yourself.
You figure out some sense of your own likelihood of getting sick.
And at that point, you will use the information rather than the
insurance company to make the same kind of calculation.
So if you're more likely to get sick with a really expensive
disease, you're going to make absolutely that you're insured.
You're going to choose the lowest possible deductible.
You're going to do other things that probably would lead you to
be more insured than somebody else.
Conversely, if you take the test and it says, boy, you're going
to be really healthy for a long time, you may decide, hey, I
want to spend more on a new car.
I'm not going to get insured.
And as soon as our insurance pool is corrupted by the fact
that people are healthy, begin to opt out, and people who,
based on private information, know they're going to get sick,
opt in in an expensive way, then the insurance companies
get swamped with people who are likely to be sick.
And then the whole idea of insurance for health care just
breaks down.
It's already breaking down.
This just speeds it up.
It's breaking down because insurance only works well when
we really have no idea who's going to be the unlucky one in
advance.
Fire insurance works pretty well because, with a few
exceptions, we don't really know whether your house is more
likely to burn down than mine.
Health insurance, we always knew your parents were a
little less healthy than mine.
Your dad may have had heart disease.
So we were nibbling away at it.
Once you present genetic information, then we've gone
far beyond nibbling.
And we have a pretty good idea who's likely to get sick,
who's not.
And at that point, the insurance system just doesn't
look like fire insurance.
It's amazing to think that suddenly something like
genetic information can be a complete game changer and
essentially say this whole economic system, this whole
model we have, just will not work.
It's a game changer.
And the paradox here is it's so good for medicine and
so bad for health insurance.
So in terms of our health, it's probably quite good.
In terms of our health care system, it's a disaster.
Every technological step forward is also a more
dangerous step for the insurance industry in that
more and more and more risks become predictable.
It's almost like you can buy your house.
And when you open up the deed, it tells you whether
or not it's going to burn down in 11 years.
And as soon as that's the case, there's no longer any
market for fire insurance.
So we are marching in that direction.
There's no doubt.
Yeah, I'd never thought about it before.
No, it's a mess.
So Hannah Whelan's conclusion is that if we have all this
information, the only long-term solution is to
mandate, to require that everyone else have insurance.
Now, Charlie Whelan, he's an economist at the
University of Chicago.
And he says that, like most economists, especially
those of the Chicago school, his first instinct is to
take a free market approach and say, hey, if
you don't want to buy health insurance, that's
fine, it's your choice.
But he says, because all this new information is going
to come, it is just inevitable.
We need mandatory universal coverage.
Yes.
Well, first, a qualification, which is I'm at the
University of Chicago, but I'm across the midway from
the Department of Economics at the policy school.
And we have to deal with some of the
extant realities in life.
But yes, there is no doubt that at a minimum, you're
going to have to require insurance.
It's so interesting, David, because this is
basically the issue at the core of the Democrats'
plan.
We've got to cover the uninsured.
But it's sort of more of an ethical argument.
No one ever actually makes this economic argument.
Yeah, I think it's a really interesting one to
think about, because it sort of argues for a
government plan.
Because if you have private plans that offer
different levels of coverage, you've still got
the same problem.
People who know they're likely to get sick will
take the expensive plan.
People who are less likely to get sick will
take the cheap plan.
And Whelan says, if you could put all the
politics aside, start from scratch, if he were
born today and could express what he wanted, it
would probably be a government plan for
everybody.
OK, but in a way, don't we actually kind of have
this already, like all my 20-something friends
who don't get health insurance just because
they're young and healthy, and they don't get it
through their job?
I mean, they're already making that choice not
to have health insurance.
Yeah, I think that's right.
And I think the answer is that it is
happening today, but in a small way.
It obviously hasn't killed the health insurance
industry.
And one explanation for why it isn't more of a
problem is just that the health care system is
so kind of messed up.
People aren't really doing this calculation in
their heads.
An employer gives you a choice of health plans.
You think about it for two minutes, you check
one box, and you're done.
And that decision, that decision as a consumer,
is something that we're really interested in.
So we've spent some time talking about doctors
as economic agents, that they're sort of half
your mom, half salesman, and part mechanic.
So we wanted to think about this in terms of
patients.
Like, who is a patient as an economic actor?
What motivates our behavior?
What motivates our spending?
We put this question out at the end of the
doctor show, and Mary Ellen Geek wrote us with
this idea.
She says, the patient is like a corporation that
hopes it is too big to fail.
So we make risky choices for our short-term
gain, and we assume that when things get
really bad, the public will have to step in
and help us.
And Michael V wrote in to say, no, he thinks
a patient is more like a student, because once
he's enrolled in school, he hands over his
authority to the teacher who knows best how
to train and teach him in a particular
discipline.
So he pays the school teacher, but he has
very little say over how he's taught.
Those are both on our blog, npr.org slash
money.
We would love to hear your ideas.
Who or what does the patient most resemble,
economically speaking?
And we actually, we'd love to hear your
beautiful voices telling this to us.
So you can call us and leave your ideas.
Who is the patient?
202-408-1271.
And we will be listening.
I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Thank you for listening.
