The cost of health care is rising faster than our economy is growing — it's an economic train wreck waiting to happen. The debate over fixing that situation rests on a couple of key questions, namely how do we get coverage for everyone and how do we control costs. That second question turns out to be much harder to answer. For all the talk about healing, a hospital is also a business. Cutting costs at a hospital falls to a hospital administrator like Daniel Kearns. He worked at a string of hospitals in the Southwest. Kearns says the hardest part of his job was dealing with doctors, like the one who wanted baseball season tickets for his family and the one who wanted a helicopter for transportation. Those may sound wacky, but Harvard health economist Tom McGuire, says neither patients, doctors nor hospitals have real incentives to trim expenses because they're all spending someone else's money.

We asked for your tales from the job market. A final one for today.

Clay Roberson writes from Austin, Tex.:

    I graduated with a BS in Communications (concentration on Media Studies) from the University of Texas in May of 2008 — right when the recession started to get warmed up. When I got back from my trip to India, I started looking for what I've been calling my "career job." I've been unable to find one.

    This is the 13th month of my job search, and I've held a lot of different part-time jobs in the meantime. I sold pollution free electricity door to door for an oddly religious subsidiary of Green Mountain Energy, I worked for the county parks department here in Travis County, and I am currently teaching English to Korean immigrant youth. This latest job has by far been the most gratifying (and lucrative), but I am still unable to make ends meet and still rely on occasional begrudging loans from my father.

    I have no health insurance and a growing number of very minor medical issues (a sprained ankle that just won't heal, for instance). Through all this the most hours I've been able to work has been 30 per week, and the average has been closer to 20. I'll continue to apply for jobs, and utilize my dwindling network, but I'm getting pretty tired of baloney sandwiches and hot dogs for every meal.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALAN GREENSPAN: We are in a recovery. And I think it would be a mistake to say the September numbers alter that significantly. It is true the last couple of weeks that some of the numbers that are coming in have been a little bit soft. But this is what a recovery looks like.

(SOUNDBITE OF DESTINY'S CHILD SONG, "BILLS, BILLS, BILLS")

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today is Monday, October 5. That was former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Do you know they used to call him Uncle Alan? Some people call him Uncle Alan.

JOFFE-WALT: Really?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: You do?

KESTENBAUM: I heard that. But - not me. But anyway, he was talking about the September unemployment numbers. On the show today, we are going to make sense of one of the most confusing, most frustrating parts of the health care world, and it is that part where you get home, and you go to the mailbox and there's a bill there from the insurance company for your doctor's visit.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And then you cry.

KESTENBAUM: Really? You cried?

JOFFE-WALT: I have wept many times, David, receiving medical bills.

KESTENBAUM: I can see getting angry, but OK. All right. Do you have a weepy one there?

JOFFE-WALT: I have one right here. I brought it in for our indicator today, and I'm just going to - it's complicated and really long. I'm going to choose one line from it. It is our indicator - $2,665. That is the amount that my husband was charged on this bill for a CT scan of his neck.

KESTENBAUM: (Whistling) It's not cheap.

JOFFE-WALT: No. And the thing is, David, that is not all that we paid for that scan. So this bill - this is from - I'm just going to tell a shortened version of this story because I can talk about it a lot. My husband goes to the emergency room. It turns out, after an afternoon there, that he has this rare lung thing - we found out from our time there. And while we were there, he got a CT and he got X-rays. And a few weeks later, we get this bill, the one that I just read to you. The total was $5,833. And the CT, as you can tell, is one of the most expensive things on here. And at the time, we had a high deductible, so it was a pretty sad day when we opened this bill. But we got on this plan to pay it over time. We sorted it out, and we thought that we were done.

KESTENBAUM: But you weren't done?

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And then we got another bill. And it's a bill for X-rays and for the CT scan.

KESTENBAUM: But you just said you just paid for a CT scan.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. Well, we thought we had paid for the CT scan, but apparently this bill was just for the physician's services related to the CT and the X-rays. So that $2,665, that was just for the CT - for the use of the equipment or whatever. The bill was for the physician's fees for assessing the images.

KESTENBAUM: You should come to me. I can do it for you a lot cheaper.

JOFFE-WALT: I'm not finished. Then another week, we get another bill, and this is for lab work. So this is all from the same one visit to one place. OK, anyway, I said I was going to do a short version. So I'm getting all worked up about this. The point is that we're talking about a lot of money, a really big expense and a big expense for something that's incredibly confusing to figure out what we are actually paying for.

KESTENBAUM: And we've actually been hearing a lot of stories like this. Basically, ever since we started reporting on health care, we've been getting emails about people's medical bills, stories and questions - tons and tons of questions.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And a lot of actually really similar questions.

KESTENBAUM: So we figured we would take some time to just answer them. And we asked Joseph Newhouse to step into the studio to help us do that. He is a professor of health policy at Harvard. He's also on the board of directors at Aetna. And his first question comes from Travis Fischer (ph).

JOFFE-WALT: Travis writes, this is something I've wondered about for a long time. Whenever I get a statement from my insurance company that shows what the insurance was charged and what the insurance paid, the difference is quite large. For instance, my son just had ear tubes put in, and I saw the bill the hospital charged my insurance company. The bill was for $1,200. But then there's this column that says amount paid, and it only shows $400. We already used up the deductible for my son, so I'm not on the hook for any of this. The bill says so. It says patient responsibility - zero.

KESTENBAUM: So what happened to the rest of the money? Who's paying the rest of the money? What happens to that? That's what we asked Joseph Newhouse.

JOSEPH NEWHOUSE: Twelve hundred dollars is, in the lingo of hospitals and insurance companies, something called a charge. And the way to think about that is what you see as the sticker price of a new car in a car dealer showroom. But very few people pay the sticker price of a new car, and probably even fewer people pay charges. So what's happened here is that your insurance company will have negotiated a rate with the hospital for this service, which, in this case, is $400. And that's what they paid. And the hospital agreed to take the $400 as payment in full. Now, if somebody had come along, say, an Arab sheikh, and wanted the same operation - didn't have - wasn't insured by an American insurance company, the hospital, in principle, would have charged that person $1,200.

JOFFE-WALT: But most people that fall into that category are not an Arab sheikh. They are people who don't have insurance who then get charged the full amount that the hospital billed, that $1,200.

NEWHOUSE: That's right. That's it.

JOFFE-WALT: And then they never pay that money.

NEWHOUSE: Most of them don't. But the hospital knows that. So the hospital will often try to work out some kind of arrangement with this person to charge them a lesser amount or give them some kind of payment schedule.

JOFFE-WALT: Why should that person have to pay $1,200 when the insurance company only has to pay how much?

NEWHOUSE: Well, because the insurance company represented a lot of patients. And it potentially could have said, if you don't give us a good rate, we're going to try to use various devices to get our - the people we insure to go to somebody else's hospital. And obviously, the uninsured person can't do that.

JOFFE-WALT: The insurance company is basically acting on behalf of a lot of people. And therefore has...

NEWHOUSE: That's right.

JOFFE-WALT: ...More power.

NEWHOUSE: You should think of it as a mass buyer that can basically get lower prices. But the - to answer the question, nothing really happened to the other $800 here. It is mostly a kind of fictitious charge and, certainly, doesn't reflect the hospital's cost that it was eating or allegedly eating.

JOFFE-WALT: So why does the hospital bill $1,200 for Travis's kid's ear tubes when they already know that they've negotiated an amount of $400 with that insurer?

NEWHOUSE: That's a very good question, and I'm not smart enough to know the answer to that. But I do know that, you know, these great long 100-page bills that hospital computers spit out that can itemize every charge from - down to the last aspirin, that isn't how most hospital bills are paid.

KESTENBAUM: Chana, so the interesting thing to me about this is that we are - I think one reason this is confusing to us, that we get a bill for some number that no one pays, is because when you go into a coffee shop, like, there's the price up there. It's $1 for the cup of coffee. If you don't have the dollar, you don't get the cup of coffee. But you don't negotiate. And what this bill is, you should be grateful for getting this confusing bill, is a little window on what's actually going on behind the scenes, which is that someone starts at some price. And then someone negotiates and you end up somewhere in the middle. And usually you just don't get to see that. So feel lucky.

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, so I should feel lucky for having this really long bill that makes no sense?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: That's what's the lesson is here.

(LAUGHTER)

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. And the thing that I wonder, too, is if the insurer has so much power as Newhouse is saying, the insurer is this mass buyer, so they have a lot of power to negotiate, why don't they just say, fine. We only want to pay you $10 for those ear tubes?

KESTENBAUM: And the answer is that they don't have endless power. They can't just say, hey. We only want to pay $10 for those tubes because, well, they probably cost more than $10. That wouldn't work. But the hospital has power also.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. And the hospital can tell the insurer, forget you. We don't want to work with you anymore. You don't pay us enough. And the - that's bad for the insurer. The insurer has to go and sell an appealing product to employers. And the insurer wants to be able to say this product that we're offering you, it's coverage at all of these major hospitals in your area, the hospital that, you know, all your favorite doctors work at.

KESTENBAUM: So the insurer maybe doesn't want to pay $1,200 for ear tubes, but they don't want the hospital to walk away and say that's fine. We won't accept your insurance anymore. So you settle somewhere in the middle. All right. Next question. This actually was very similar to yours, Chana.

JOFFE-WALT: This is from Dale Borgeson (ph). And Dale writes, a few months ago, I had outpatient hernia repair surgery. And I was in at 8 a.m. I was out by 3 p.m. It went very well. In the following weeks, I received a host of bills and statements, a whole bunch of, you know, surgeon, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthesiologist, surgery PA, hospital. And Dale writes, what struck me is that there are four people whose services were billed separately. So the first question here is, you know, why is Dale getting so many different bills?

NEWHOUSE: That's also a good question. And I think the answer to it is that these various people that are billing Dale view themselves as independent professionals. And for Dale to get one bill, basically there would have to be something like a general contractor or an employer who employed other, in this case, doctors. And doctors have historically resisted that. They've wanted to be - not uniformly. But traditionally, they've wanted to be independent professionals, or many of them have. And that implies that they could bill in their own name.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So we think...

NEWHOUSE: So...

JOFFE-WALT: We think when we go to the hospital that we're going to one place. People work at that place. We're going to get one bill. But actually, that place is basically just a home for a bunch of different independent contractors.

NEWHOUSE: Oh, yes. We do get one bill for things like the nurses at the hospital, and the cooks that make the meal in the hospital and the janitors that clean the floors in the hospital. But the doctors will often bill - typically bill independently. It's very common to have a separate bill from a surgeon and from an anesthesiologist.

JOFFE-WALT: Because they're not necessarily employees of the hospital.

NEWHOUSE: No. Nor are they employees of each other.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. OK. So this lastly, this Dale continues with a second question. So this Dale who got the four different bills. The thing that occurred to me is that if I had to pay the whole price on my own, how would that work? I wouldn't want to pay the list price. I would think that since I would be paying in cash in advance, if necessary, I should get at least the same discount as the insurance company negotiated.

NEWHOUSE: Well, this goes back to the insurance company's power. The insurance company has a lot more clout with the hospital and the doctor than Dale does as an individual. And maybe Medicare has the ultimate amount of clout because it actually just sets a price and said if you don't like this, Dr. Smith, you can walk away from it. But very few doctors do that.

JOFFE-WALT: So I just have one more. This is from Alissa (ph). She says, I have weird moles, and skin cancer runs in my family. So I'm supposed to go to the dermatologist every six months to get them checked. So I make an appointment to see my primary care physician, and she gives me a referral to go to my dermatologist to get the moles checked. This time one comes back as freaky, according to the pathologist, so I need to have it removed. But a different person in the same office removes moles. So I have to go to the primary care physician again to get another referral, even though the pathologist said scary. Remove this. And since the referrals are only good for a couple of months, in six months, I have to go to the primary care physician again in order to get another referral. I have to do this for every specialist I see every time. There's no such thing as a lifetime referral to have a dermatologist check every six months. How is this a good use of resources? I know my time isn't considered a resource to the insurance company, but I'm only paying a $15 copay each time. They're paying a little over a hundred for every doctor's visit.

NEWHOUSE: This does sound like a very inefficient use of resources. And many types of insurance plans now, there is not the need for a referral. But I believe this persists because it saves ultimately some money. Now whether this money that's saved comes because people don't do things that they should be doing from the point of view of their health is just an open question.

JOFFE-WALT: From an insurance company perspective, what do you think might be happening here?

NEWHOUSE: Oh, I think the idea was that there should be somebody looking over the patient's - all of the patient's care to try to make sure they weren't getting too much service. And the nominee for that job was going to be the primary care physician.

JOFFE-WALT: This was meant to prevent having too much done to this person...

NEWHOUSE: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: ...From being overtreated.

NEWHOUSE: That was clearly the original intent of this. But it - as I say, it introduces a lot of administrative complexity and hassle, as your listeners are reflecting. And undoubtedly there was some - there were some patients who said it's just too much hassle to go get a referral every time. I'm going to - instead of going in every six months, I'm going to go in every 12 months. And so that saves some money. It may have built up some downstream costs because the patient didn't go in. Or worse, it may have built up some bad health events. You know, there's errors in both directions here. You - maybe it prevented some people from going in when that was just fine. It saves some money. And maybe it prevented people from going in when they should have gone in.

KESTENBAUM: Chana, that is - that answer totally makes sense. And it is totally frustrating to think that possibly requiring referrals saves money and is also totally annoying.

JOFFE-WALT: Right.

KESTENBAUM: I mean, you want someone to be angry at, right? Or you want an easy fix.

JOFFE-WALT: You wanted to be able to be pissed off. Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: I mean, although this practice is waning some. It's often called the gatekeeper model. And it's not being used quite as much. But basically, yeah, the idea being that the gatekeeper would be your primary care physician. Somebody would be watching over everything that happens to you so that we can avoid unnecessary medical attention.

KESTENBAUM: And unnecessary medical attention, we know that is driving up the cost of health care. That is actually one of the few clear things we can point to and say it's a huge part of the problem. So this is what we talked about on the podcast previously. Researchers at Dartmouth with the Health Atlas studying treatments all around the United States, and they conclude that if we could cut back on unnecessary treatment, we might be able to save up to maybe a third. But the question is, how do you do that? Do you have an insurance company require that you get referrals for everything? Because that would - that might help, but at the same time, people hate it.

JOFFE-WALT: I have actually found it useful, David, just in making sense of all this stuff, to try to think like an insurance company because there is so much mystery here. And then in a lot of ways, you know, we are so many steps separated from them. For most of us, there's money that disappears from our paycheck, and then it gets combined with money from our boss. And then, you know, with all the money from our co-workers' paychecks and then it gets shipped off to some insurance company, and they do their voodoo. And then the next thing we know, we get some insane bills like this one. Or we're just, you know, stuck trying to decipher a massive booklet of things that the insurance company does not cover.

KESTENBAUM: But every once in a while, you do have these moments where you get to see a little bit from the other side - you understand how the insurance company sees us, how what we do affects them and how they're very carefully watching what we do. So we have a story for you about that now. It happened to our very own Laura Conaway, and this was back in the 1990s when she was working at a newspaper in Maine.

LAURA CONAWAY, BYLINE: When I first walked in, the place had a very kind of old-fashioned - what they call indemnity plan. It was insurance before there was such a thing as an HMO. And it came with a couple of booklets. And you walked in. They hand you these booklets, and I seriously never really understood what - how you went to the doctor. I never went to the doctor, that - the whole thing just seemed kind of opaque and designed to get you not to use it, basically. So we went along on this, and I always thought, well, that's good. You know, at least if I get hit by a truck, I'll have some means of going to the doctor. And literally, I just put it in my top file drawer, and I never looked at it again.

In 1997, the big insurer there in the state decided that they would roll out an HMO plan. And these couple guys came in, and they handed out these really handy sheets of exactly what we could get and how we went about getting it. And they just spelled it all right out. You know, if you went to the doctor in network, that would be $10. If you went to the doctor out of network, that would be $25 or whatever it was. It was the first time anybody had ever explained to us what that meant. So in Maine, what had happened was the chiropractic lobby, the lobby of chiropractors, was very powerful, and they had gone to the state legislature and gotten it so that they would be treated the same way as a primary care physician. And that meant that you could go to a chiropractor in the network for $10.

And we all thought that just sounded wonderful. So we ran down to this one chiropractor who was about three or four blocks away from the office, and we just - basically, just started a serial rotation. There was no end to how many times you could go to the chiropractor for $10, and for five more dollars, you could get massage therapy because your chiropractor could refer you to massage therapy. So she had somebody right there in the office who was doing massage therapy, and it became sort of a Friday afternoon treat to run down to get your back cracked and then get yourself rubbed.

KESTENBAUM: Did you all have back problems?

CONAWAY: You know, I don't know that I had any more back problems before that than I did after going to the chiropractor for a while. It just felt great. Anyway, we went on this way for, you know, into next year or so, just using this thing like crazy. And the HMO people came back to us, and they said, you know, we're going to have to raise all your premiums and your deductibles. I don't think that they expected us to make that level of use.

KESTENBAUM: They came into your office and said that.

CONAWAY: Yeah, they just - you know, your - you've had that experience, right? Your company comes to you and says we have to change the health plan because it's too expensive or whatever. And they came back to the company and said, you know, we can't keep doing this like this.

JOFFE-WALT: To me, the thing that's interesting about this is that there's often this disconnect between how you behave and how you use services and your premium because it's, like, a few steps removed from you. At that moment, did you kind of realize - you're like, oh, what we are doing on Friday afternoons when we go to the chiropractor and when we get those massages, somebody has to pay for that?

CONAWAY: When they came back in and did that, it really felt like free lunch was over.

JOFFE-WALT: So, David, I should say that after my very leading question there, that Laura made it clear that, you know, she doesn't - no one knows for sure that's why premiums were going up. But they all did have this uh-oh kind of feeling.

KESTENBAUM: You know, sometimes premiums go up, and you have no idea why. And then sometimes you think, oh, maybe I do know what's going on here. What I like about that story is it lays out the peril of insurance, which is that it separates you from the money you're spending. So you don't want to be in a situation where you want to use your insurance, I mean, like, for cheap massages. It would be like me getting insurance for chocolate chip cookies or something. You know, I'd love it, but no one's going to sell it to me because I would just eat a million of them, right? And the premiums would go through the roof.

JOFFE-WALT: Yes. So insurance is not supposed to be for things like chocolate chip cookies. It's supposed to be for unpredictable stuff, though, sometimes that line is kind of gray. An insurance company can say we're not going to cover massages, but then maybe everyone picks the insurance plan that does cover massages.

KESTENBAUM: Poor insurance companies.

JOFFE-WALT: No. Poor us with all these complicated bills. Even when I can kind of see the other side of things, I still think there has got to be a better way to do this.

KESTENBAUM: All right. Well, thank you to Laura and Joseph Newhouse and all of you who sent us your great questions for helping us add a little light to the darkness. We love hearing what's got you confused, what you're wondering about. The best way to share that is by sending us an email to planetmoney@npr.org.

JOFFE-WALT: Or you can go to our website, npr.org/money. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
This morning, we received additional signs that the worst may be behind us.
Though we lost 247,000 jobs in July, that was nearly 200,000 fewer jobs lost than in June,
and far fewer than the nearly 700,000 jobs a month that we were losing at the beginning of the year.
Today, we're pointed in the right direction.
I've got a lot of old friends that are getting back in touch, and it's a pretty good feeling.
Yeah, it feels pretty good.
I get a lot of double takes when I'm coming around the corners,
and it's mostly pretty nice. Yeah, it's mostly pretty all right.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Chana Jaffee-Walt in New York City.
And I'm David Kestenbaum in Baltimore. That's right, Planet Money.
We cover the whole planet, New York City, Washington, D.C., and even some place in between.
Today is Friday, August 7th. Today, we take economics to the doctor.
Actually, hang on, I mixed things up. The economics is fine. It's health care that's messed up.
We are going to take health care for a visit to the economists.
Yes, health care is shaping up to be the economic issue of the summer.
And we here at Planet Money, we are interested in economics.
The more we keep digging into health care, the more economic treasures we are finding.
Treasures? Do you really mean treasures?
Don't you mean like a spider web trap or those Chinese finger traps
where you put your fingers in and you can't pull them out?
Yeah, it's a little messy. Okay, but before we get to the mess,
we have to do our indicator. David, it's one of the big ones.
It's one we wait for day after day.
It is the monthly unemployment rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics posted it today.
It is 9.4% for July, which is down 0.1% from June.
Contrary to most predictions, though the White House is saying it still does expect unemployment
to peak above 10%, so maybe it's a blip.
But we are actually starting to hear from some of you that it feels a little bit like the ice is breaking.
One person we talked to, Pam Chozen of Bloomington, Indiana, she's a copywriter.
She writes things like ads and junk mail.
And she told Laura Conaway here at Planet Money that she's been looking for work nonstop
since she got laid off four months ago.
And in those four months, I interviewed with a local medical devices company
that was looking for an internal marketing person.
That was one interview.
And I had an interview with an agency in Toledo, Ohio, probably three weeks ago now.
And that was it.
That was the only response I had gotten to all of these dozens of inquiries I'd made.
And then starting on Monday morning this week,
I suddenly got within the space of about two hours three emails from agencies I'd applied to.
One I'd applied to a few weeks ago, a couple I had applied to over the weekend.
And they wanted to talk to me, which was just incredibly puzzling.
Because so few people had before this.
Right.
And furthermore, I also heard back from my former employer who wanted to know
if I was interested in doing some contract work for them on a project basis.
Answer being?
Yes, absolutely yes.
Wow, that is so nice to hear, Hannah.
It is. It's nice to hear somebody sounding happy.
I'm going to kill it now, though.
We should say that the overall picture for the labor market is not really clear.
Already some people are saying unemployment dropped because people gave up on finding work.
They just stopped looking.
But this is the first decline in 15 months.
And you're right, it feels better than reporting another big increase.
Okay, see, financial crisis, problem solved.
It's on its way to being solved.
So, Hannah, next problem, please.
Right, let's just move on, clear our hands of that.
The next problem would be health care.
Go at it, David.
All right, so as we hear often from the president, and frankly, as we've heard for years,
the cost of health care is rising.
It is rising much faster than our economy is growing, which is going, at some point,
it's going to be a train wreck for us, you and me, and for the government,
which spends a lot of money on health care every year.
Yeah, so basically there are these two big things that people talk about all the time with health care recently.
So the two things, how do we get everyone or at least a lot more people covered, insured,
and how do we control costs?
And it turns out that second question, how to control the costs,
it turns out that is a much, much harder question to answer.
Right, and the more that I ask people it, the more I get totally overwhelmed.
I have felt very close to tears sometimes looking into health care and trying to understand it.
But so we're going to just take it piece by piece over the next couple of weeks.
And today we're going to start talking about hospitals.
So just basic hospitals, they're businesses.
No way.
No, they are places of healing, Hannah.
They are healing centers.
They are.
But you know, son, they don't run on karma.
They run on money.
OK, so everybody knows that.
But I still feel like that can be kind of easy to forget.
So there are nonprofit hospitals and for-profit hospitals.
Government run hospitals, but basically they're all businesses with budgets and expenses.
And the person who runs that business is a hospital administrator.
And that person, they don't have anything to do with medical decisions.
Yeah, yeah.
I get it, fat face.
And this person, they sit in some office that me as a patient, I never, ever see.
Right.
But I met one recently.
This guy, his name is Daniel Kearns.
And we were chatting.
He worked as a hospital administrator for a bunch of hospitals in the Southwest.
He's retired now.
And so we were chatting and I just I asked him, you know, OK, you ran hospitals.
Hospitals are big, big spenders in the health care system.
So how come?
What are the costs?
What is the hardest part about containing costs?
Is it, you know, the uninsured people keeping up with the equipment?
What is it?
And at first he just said, oh, you know, there are many answers to that question.
But then he said, OK, you know what the hardest part of the job is?
Dealing with the doctors, doctors and all their needs.
Because basically this guy, Daniel Kearns, he's in a strange position for a business guy
because he wants to keep his costs low.
He wants to bring in business.
Hannah, you keep forgetting this is a healing center.
We bring in people, not business.
These are patients.
Right. OK, so we're not saying hospitals don't care about patients, but they they are running
businesses and to survive, to bring in business otherwise known as patients.
Daniel Kearns, he needs doctors and preferably specialists so he can say those three
beautiful words that every hospital administrator wants to say center of excellence.
You know, so they could say this doctor has done 2000 high risk births come here
where the center of excellence and high risk births or diabetes treatment.
Administrators love those words and you need doctors to be able to say them.
So Kearns, he would recruit these doctors and the doctors knew their special skills
were moneymakers for people like Kearns.
So, you know, when I was talking to him, he just shakes his head.
He says that was the hardest part because they were always asking for things.
So I say, like what?
And he says, you know, brand new lab with the best new machines.
That sounds totally reasonable.
Right. OK. And then other perks like he had a doctor who always wanted season tickets
to baseball for his wife and his four kids.
But then David and he just he just mumbled this one one time.
A physician requesting that a helicopter be at his disposal for transportation
so he could avoid traffic.
A helicopter like a helicopter pick me up at my house.
Pick me up at my home and take me to the hospital
because I don't want to be in traffic in the morning and stuff.
And there just became, you know, it's like any.
Wait, wait. Why? Why did why did he need a helicopter?
I think there's a three letter word ego.
I think I why I know I my response was this is a joke.
You know, this you know, this isn't happening.
I mean, you're just like, you know, it's almost like one of those things.
You're like, well, you know, what else could happen today?
You know, this is crazy.
But it just came out, you know.
And so in order to play the game of retaining that particular physician,
that's what he wanted that day.
How do you even land a helicopter in like a residential neighborhood?
His actually home.
His home was large enough where it was located to accommodate it.
And they had a landing pad or a field or something.
I didn't ride along for sure.
So you went ahead with the helicopter.
Three trips. Thank you very much.
Not the highlight of my career.
You know, I mean, it's just so you know, you know, it's kind of like,
I don't know what it's like, but it's like testing the waters.
Hannah, a helicopter?
You know, I have a friend who works in Hollywood who told me about a certain movie star
that took a helicopter to the set every day.
They had to clear out this parking lot for the thing to land.
But I mean, most physicians I know, they drive to work or they bike to work or something.
Yeah. So, so, so Corinne says this specialist, he was really valuable.
He brought in huge volume for the hospital.
And by that, he means David patients.
By that, he means money.
And he really didn't want to lose him.
Yeah, but a helicopter?
Well, OK, so this gets at one of the many, many parts of the health care system
that economists say is terribly misaligned.
Misaligned? Like it needs a cast or something?
I feel like you're going to bring in the economist now.
You're so on it, David.
OK, Tom McGuire, he's our guy today.
He's a health care economist at Harvard.
I told him this helicopter story and he said,
Oh, my God, that completely signifies how weird this hospital doctor relationship is.
Because most doctors aren't employed by the hospital.
So I didn't actually realize this, but usually most of the doctors in any particular hospital,
they are not employees of that hospital.
So they get to choose where they want to practice.
And the hospital is really desperate to get to say those three beautiful words,
center of excellence.
So people like Corinne's, it leaves him in a really weird position.
He can't pay them directly to admit patients.
That's considered a kickback.
So we have this weird system where it isn't like you and I,
sure all of us might like to get a helicopter ride to work.
Yeah, I think my commute actually down to D.C. would probably be about 15 minutes or something.
Forget it, David, you would never get the helicopter ride.
I know.
Because you're a paid employee like most people.
So here's Tom McGuire, the Harvard economist.
Lots of people would like these things.
I would love to be helicoptered into my work every day.
But people would laugh at me if I asked that.
My employer writes me a paycheck.
And if I do well and the employer wants to reward me and keep me,
the mechanism they do that with is a conventional employee-employer relationship.
In the case of hospitals and doctors,
that doctor probably doesn't work at the hospital.
The doctor probably doesn't get a paycheck directly from the hospital.
There's a kind of exchange taking place.
The doctor is permitted to do his work in the hospital and his operations.
He doesn't pay for the resources he uses because he brings in patients
who then have insurance that pays the hospital.
But there's no way to balance the employee-employer relationship in a conventional way.
So hospitals are led to provide inducements and rewards to doctors outside of a normal wage.
It's kind of an exchange.
I'll bring you my patients and you get the bill for the hospital portion of those services.
That's what the doctor brings to the hospital
and what the hospital gives to the physician is the free resources.
Hospital is an independent corporate entity that's opening its door to doctors
and says, sure, come in here, do your work,
and we're not going to charge you anything to do that.
Yeah, free resources, which include our helicopter.
I don't know, it just doesn't feel right.
Okay, so why, David, why doesn't it feel right?
Let me play the enraged listener here.
It's ridiculous. I mean, why?
Because he doesn't want to be in traffic for five minutes?
Forget it. It's just, it's too much luxury for a doctor.
Yeah, okay. So of course, you know, right away when I hear this story I'm rolling my eyes
because to me it just sounds lavish and silly.
But then I was talking to Daniel Kearns, the hospital administrator,
and he said this thing which made me realize that there is actually a much better reason
to be annoyed by this and one we strangely don't think of first.
Because it's coming out of patient care, essentially.
I mean, as far as the funding, the hospital gets its money by billing patients.
That's the bottom line. That's the reality, you know,
but it's not really thought of that way.
You know, I mean, you don't, a patient wouldn't necessarily look up and see a helicopter.
Well, I paid for that.
So then things, like I say, it became a clandestine, you know,
where it wasn't advertised, where it wasn't.
And that's the thing is that the patient wouldn't look up and think, I paid for that.
But the doctor also probably wouldn't ride in that helicopter
and think, haha, patients, you're all paying for this.
It's like nobody is actually thinking about where that money is coming from.
You know, I have my ego fulfilled and that's my reality.
It's just not the way the system should have run.
So this is the thing that Daniel Kearns kept saying over and over
when we were talking that his trial as an administrator
was that he was the only one thinking about cost.
The doctor gets free resources. He's going to use them.
And he's going to push those limits to the max.
The patient doesn't think, you know, oh, that's coming out of my pocket.
So Kearns says, you know, I am all alone in thinking about containing costs here.
Wait, wait. Well, I mean, Daniel Kearns, he cares about containing his costs,
but he is paying for the helicopter, right?
Because his job is to make a profit for the hospital.
So he cares about containing costs for his hospital,
say for a procedure or something, but he doesn't care.
It's not his job to care about containing costs for the collective whole.
So his motivations are to make money for his hospital.
And if he needs to buy helicopter rides to do that,
if that makes economic sense, he should be doing that.
He will do that, which, you know, at least he'll consider doing that.
And Tom Maguire, the economist, he says that this is basically, you know,
it's like marketing costs for the hospital.
Hospitals, they're fighting over market share.
And no, paying for a helicopter to help this one hospital
does not help contain costs for the collective whole.
But that money is coming from you and I.
We're paying taxes that pay for Medicare, that pay doctors,
and we're paying premiums that pay hospitals, that pay doctors.
Honey, you know what? One economist told me, he said,
the whole problem with the system is that everyone is spending someone else's money.
Yeah, and that's true for doctors, and it's true for hospitals,
and it's also true for patients, which Tom Maguire told me about.
Patients have insurance, and that protects them against
all of the immediate costs of their care.
Patients don't know what the cost of the staff in the operating room is,
what the cost of the machines are, let alone the cost of the hospital.
And we do that because we want to ensure patients against financial risk.
Maguire says this is one of the fundamental problems
with health care resource allocation.
So there's this trade-off happening between
protecting people against financial risk
and then transmitting to them incentives to be careful when they use services.
So you can either cover people and have them not really think about costs,
or you cannot cover them and have them think about costs,
but then they're subject to all this financial risk.
And that's just an insurance problem in general.
You get in an accident with your insured car,
you're going to try to get the most expensive,
best repairs that the insurance company will pay for.
So participating in the health care market is more like that
than walking into a supermarket with cash in your hand.
Because if it were like buying one thing over another,
you probably wouldn't decide to be handing your money to a doctor
so he could write a health copy to her.
Exactly. So basically, Maguire says that means
that it can't be left up to the patient to control costs.
If we think it's important, as we do,
to protect patients against financial risk when they become sick,
then almost it follows immediately that they're not going to be concerned
with the cost when they use care.
So somebody else has to be minding that store.
So, Hannah, there are people, of course,
who would argue with Maguire on that,
who think there are ways to drive health care costs down
by giving the patients more, economists would call it skin in the game,
making them maybe pay a greater share of things.
So maybe they'll choose a drug that's not quite as good,
but it's a lot cheaper or something like that.
But let's just say for the moment, system as it is now,
the patient is not going to be concerned with keeping costs down.
And it looks like the hospital isn't going to do it,
and the doctors aren't going to do it.
So who is left minding the store?
We've been thinking about this a lot.
And economically here, I think, if you ask that question,
who would have the strong incentive to drive down costs
and keep the quality of health care high at the same time?
That player here would be the insurance companies,
because if they can provide cost-effective care,
they can charge you and me less.
They should be able to beat their competitors.
They can get more people to sign up with them.
Maybe they can make more profits.
So that's the way you think it might work.
It hasn't quite worked that way.
And we're going to actually leave you to puzzle over why it doesn't,
because we are still puzzling over that one.
I have done a bunch of interviews,
and we are going to bring that stuff to you on a future podcast.
Yes, OK.
So in the meantime, we would love to hear your economic perspectives
on health care, on insurance companies,
on doctors who fly helicopters,
whatever you would like to tell us.
