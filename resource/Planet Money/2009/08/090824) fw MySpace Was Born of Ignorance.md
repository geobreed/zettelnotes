If you find MySpace more chaotic than Facebook, that's no accident. Founders Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson wanted to create a site that's just as disorienting as your average nightclub, a crazy landscape of musicians and models and Hollywood desire, says Julia Angwin, author of Stealing Myspace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America. DeWolfe and Anderson came to their social networking juggernaut from the world of porn and spyware. Their greatest asset? Complete ignorance, Angwin says. Not knowing what to fear, the entrepreneurs just dove in. It gave them a great beginning — and an Achilles heel.

In February, MySpace founders Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson paid a visit to Charlie Rose. In April, DeWolfe stepped down as CEO. Maybe it's just the format, but we think you can see DeWolfe and Anderson sweating it already in this interview.

**faster whisper:**
How are you going to monetize all these users?
Well, we are right now, and that's one thing that Tom and I have been working together for
ten years, and that's one thing that we've always had in common,
was that we wanted to build... Passion for monetizing. Passion for monetizing and building a big, scalable business, get money.
Hello, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg. Today is Monday, August 24th. At the top of the podcast, you heard
MySpace founders Chris DeWolf and Tom Anderson talking to Charlie Rhodes earlier this year.
And we're going to be hearing a lot about those guys on the upcoming podcast. But first,
the Planet Money Indicator.
All right. I'm checking right now. It is 706.
706?
Facebook friends.
That you have.
That I have.
I have 706 Facebook friends, and in fact, I have one invite and a suggestion to ask
Scott Carrier to be my Facebook friend, which I'm going to do right now.
How many of those people do you actually know?
I don't know.
Well, never mind. Forget about Facebook for one minute. Change your status update to read
Listening Intently to Planet Money because we have a rollicking show for you today.
For the next 15 minutes, we're going to be talking about MySpace, specifically the
story of how MySpace got its start.
And Alex, I want to say, if you are a person who cares nothing about MySpace, I
am certainly such a person. I could not care less about MySpace. I've never used
MySpace. I have no interest in MySpace.
Clearly, you're a Facebook man.
I'm not even that much of a Facebook man, to be honest.
But I read this book, Stealing MySpace, the Battle to Control the Most Popular
Website in America, and I was hooked. I could not put it down.
I have a full disclosure confession to make.
So this book is written by Julia Angwin, who's a reporter and editor at the
Wall Street Journal. She also happens to be one of my best friends from college.
So she asked, you know, she sent me a copy of her new book, and I, being
polite, thought, well, I have a lot to read, so I don't have a lot of time
to read some book about MySpace. I'll read the first few pages, so I have not
something nice to say. I couldn't put it down.
I mean, the stories of the scams and battles and ugly, terrible people
behind MySpace were so fascinating.
Really, I just read it all in a weekend.
Right. And basically, the craziest thing is that, like, when you think of
MySpace, you think of the classic Internet startup gone huge.
Like Amazon, eBay.
Amazon, eBay, Google, all those things where it's sort of like, you know,
it's sort of like it's part of a plan. It starts in Silicon Valley, and
it's sort of like...
These math geniuses who have been planning it for years and are five
years ahead of everybody else understanding how we're going to be
using the Internet.
Right, exactly. And it's just all these smart people who have just
sort of like developing, and then they roll out their product and it gets
bought in an IPO, and that's how it starts. And it turns out MySpace...
No, that's not how MySpace...
Not at all.
These are the bottom feeders of the Internet.
And MySpace isn't even a Silicon Valley company at all. It turns out
there's a whole other world, right?
Yeah, there's this whole world I didn't know about. I actually lived in
LA when a lot of this was going on, and I didn't even know that
there's a big LA Hollywood Internet startup scene that's really different
from the Silicon Valley startup scene.
So Silicon Valley, like you said, you have to have a PhD in computer
science, you have to be a brilliant coder.
Hollywood, you just need to have a gift of the gab and a desire for
money.
Right, so it's sort of like the Silicon Valley is the nerds, the
Hollywood startup scene is the hustlers.
Is the hustlers. And so these were hustlers, the guys who founded it,
Tom Anderson and Christa Wolf, who founded MySpace. They worked at
this company whose entire purpose was to make the Internet really,
really lousy for the rest of us. And what I've found fascinating is
these guys, everything that you find creepy or that frustrates you
about the Internet, they were doing.
Right, MySpace, it turns out, was not their idea at the very
beginning, and they only got to it after a long series of sort of
accidents in other things that they were trying to do, sort of
scams basically.
They're certainly pretty close to scams, yeah.
They would look at the Internet, figure out how other people were
making money, and just copy their ideas.
So porn, they did porn.
They saw that people were making a lot of money with spyware and
pop-up ads and just sort of horrible, annoying, blinking ads to
sell really junky products, selling email lists, all of that stuff.
And Julius says, you know, these guys sort of perfected the art
form of copying scams and brought almost a level of evil genius.
Right after 9-11, whatever it was in this patriotic fervor, they
came out with a little cursor that would make where your mouse
shows up on your screen look like an American flag.
And so all these people downloaded it and they were like,
oh, I'm showing my patriotism.
And actually it was spyware that was tracking your every
move on the Internet.
So by downloading the cursor software, you're actually
installing a software program that is tracking you.
Yeah.
And not only that, it's serving ads to you.
So when you try to go to Google and search for, you know,
cars, it serves up a pop-up ad on top of what you're trying
to find of a car ad.
And this company, what was it called?
It was...
E-Universe.
E-Universe.
It's one of these classic stories where they just were, they
got a lot of investor money and sort of you look and think,
why would anyone give them any money?
And, you know, it sounds like they had presentations that
were, you know, sounded like gobbledygook about how,
oh, we're on top of the future synergy.
They were basically selling remote control cars and face cream.
Oh, yeah.
There was actually a lot of their money came from
wrinkle cream.
So they had these ads called Better Than Botox, which
you probably actually distantly recall seeing somewhere on
the Internet because they were plastered everywhere.
And they were supposedly like a free trial of some wrinkle
cream that was going to remove wrinkles from your
face.
But once you sent in your credit card for supposedly,
for authorization purposes, this wrinkle cream kept
coming in.
It was every month and you couldn't get it to stop.
And they're just like thousands of complaints with
the Better Business Bureau.
But they were minting money off of this wrinkle
cream.
So in their hunt for the next porn spyware
opportunity, they noticed that everybody's trying to
create the next social media platform.
Right.
And there's all these people in Silicon Valley who have
all sorts of theories about how human society is
structured and technical ways to amplify the natural
connections.
And anthropologists are writing dissertations on
this topic.
These guys are just, what are they thinking?
Copying.
So they're not thinking at all.
They're just, they are, Tom, actually, who had run
a porn site on the side was really famous for
trolling around the Internet and particularly for
looking for cute girls.
So Friendster was a hot Silicon Valley property
where there were a lot of cute girls, including
one named Tila Tequila, who's managed to crawl her
way up from, I think she's probably still D-list
celebrity, but maybe C, by virtue of MySpace.
So he saw that there were people like her on
Friendster and he made it his mission to recruit
them to a copycat site, MySpace, which was
basically the same as Friendster in all respects,
except that it was more permissive.
So Tila Tequila wants to pose sort of wearing
barely any clothing.
She kept getting kicked off Friendster.
So MySpace was like, sure.
Do whatever you want.
Yeah, bring it on.
I mean, one of the things that's the most
fascinating is how they just happened to be at
a moment where their complete technical
incompetence was the best possible thing.
It was.
Actually, it's a great story about how it's
both their biggest advantage and their
worst enemy, which is often the case, right?
My best trades roles are my worst.
So, you know, they were totally ignorant of
sort of the technical challenge of what they
were doing.
So they dove right in.
Sort of ignorance is bliss.
And they were quick to make changes.
So when the user said they wanted a certain
feature, they threw it out there, even though
it totally sucked and it didn't, it was
really buggy.
And they were constantly crashing the whole
system.
But they didn't care.
And so they were able to just move quickly
and create, they didn't waste time perfecting
features that weren't going to be popular.
So they basically threw everything out there
and the ones that turned out to have some
traction, then they would spend time working
to perfect those.
So it was actually kind of a good strategy.
In the end, when they became a big site,
it turned against them because they couldn't
keep it up and they couldn't keep up with
Facebook on a technical.
Certainly for me, I remember I was in
Iraq when MySpace hit big and all these
soldiers were on MySpace.
They loved MySpace.
Right.
And so I remember just going, you know, I
had a pretty good internet connection and
you go to any army base in Baghdad or in
Iraq and there's, you know, certainly by
the, after the Americans had been there
like eight months or so, almost every
army base had a little internet cafe,
usually actually staffed by Iraqis was
sort of awesome.
And they were all there on their MySpace
pages.
Right.
And so I checked it out and I, it's
just too chaotic.
It's just, I didn't know where my eyes
should look.
It's ugly.
It's difficult.
Right.
And when I saw Facebook, it made more
sense to me.
It's more, it's more calming.
I'm not a huge Facebook user, but at
least I know what's going on.
Right.
I'm able to interact.
But my understanding is that, that
there is a bit of a age and class
issue with the division.
Yeah.
I mean, look, MySpace was designed,
I mean, I call it the nightclub
strategy versus the Ivy League
strategy.
So MySpace was trying to create that
feeling of disorientation that you
have when you go into a nightclub.
And they wanted to stock it with
models and musicians, which is also
what you're looking for in a
nightclub.
And so it has all that aspects of
a nightclub, the flashing lights and
the disorientation and the kind of
crazy where should I look and lots
of like people wearing strange
clothing.
So that's their vibe.
That's their market.
And kind of anything goes.
And anything goes.
Right.
And, you know, I think that the
strategy is really deliberate and it
does appeal to a different segment.
So I felt like as someone who tries
to do narrative journalism,
your biggest challenge is everyone's
a jerk.
I mean, the the most shocking
thing that you accomplished is
there's a good chunk of the book
where the guy you're rooting for,
the guy you like the most is Rupert
Murdoch.
I know that is really nobody's
put it that way.
But you're right.
It's pretty funny.
Because you have these two guys, Tom
and Chris.
Right.
Who found it.
And you sort of think they hit
the lottery.
I mean, they happened to copy the
right thing at the right moment and
they all became insanely rich.
But they're all battling each other
in these ugly battles to make sure
that each one was more rich than the
other guys.
Yes, totally.
And then we know there's a lot of
fascinating nuance about Rupert
Murdoch buying MySpace and how
just all the personal politics
behind the scenes.
But but basically there isn't a
hero here.
Yes, it's a challenge.
And my editor at Random House
was concerned about that.
And I I agreed with him that it
was a hard book to write because
there were no heroes.
But I also felt like every
character, you just couldn't make
these people up.
They were so great.
I mean, you just as a journalist,
when you stumble on this kind of
cast of characters and each one
of them with their strange, you
know, Tom with his Asian porn
fetish and you know, you just
you can't help.
You have to write it and just hope
that the reader will come along
for the ride because they're just
equally fascinated.
It's very voyeuristic, actually,
the way that MySpace is.
Right.
And I got to say it total it
does work.
It ultimately for me made me feel
good about myself because these
guys are much richer than I am
insanely rich.
Right.
But they're such jerks and they
all get screwed in different ways
and it's very satisfying.
And I would not have cared when
I learned that Krista Wolf was
recently fired by Rupert Murdoch.
If I hadn't read your book, I
wouldn't have even noticed.
But I was really happy to hear
that.
He still has hundreds of
millions of dollars and I'm sure
he's doing fine.
But I don't think he had a
good month in that.
I hate to say it makes me a
petty person, but I'm a
pleasurably petty person.
So I was struggling with what
the lesson here is.
You know, MySpace was doing
really, really well.
And then it has stopped doing
as well.
But it still is a very
successful site.
Is that right?
Yeah.
I mean, it's on a very steep
decline right now.
They're losing millions of
members a month, which is a
bad sign.
However, they're trying to
double down on music, which
is their core.
Musicians still like the idea
of having their page on MySpace
and their friends.
And so if they can hold on to
that niche, I think they could
remain relevant.
But honestly, it's a
challenge.
They're in a very bad place
right now.
So I guess the lesson is, or
let me ask you if the
lesson is, if you really want
a longtime success, do the
Silicon Valley thing.
Be smart, be careful, be
excellent.
If you want to get really
rich really quickly, do the
Hollywood thing and just copy
everyone else's ideas and do
it sloppily.
Actually, I came to a
different conclusion.
So I think you're sort of
right there.
But I also think that one
thing I realized was that the
Silicon Valley thing was a
bit of a myth.
So as I thought about it
more, I realized, you know
what, like Steve Jobs, he's
not such a great programmer.
He's actually a great
marketer, right?
And Bill Gates, he wasn't the
greatest programmer.
He was also a great, I would
say he was a great marketing
strategist.
And Microsoft is certainly
famously a copier of other
people's ideas.
Yes, exactly.
So in a way what I
realized was that I had a
false idea about what
Silicon Valley was.
The myth of Silicon Valley
is about technical
competence.
But the reality is that
marketing still makes a
huge difference.
And so I kind of came to
the conclusion that all
these guys are hucksters who
really cross the line to
brilliance.
It is a wonderful journey to
go where you focus in on a
handful of total scam artists
and find out, oh, everyone's
a scam artist.
A scam artist, c'est moi.
Yes.
Yes.
So thank you to Julia
Engwin.
We are going to be spending
this week focusing on
regulatory reform.
Expect some really exciting,
thrilling radio stories.
Radio stories in the near
future about that topic.
Now, you sound sarcastic,
but I believe that we can
deliver on that promise of
making regulatory reform not
only interesting,
fascinating, funny,
heartbreaking.
It's all coming up.
Even though we almost gave
up.
Right, we did almost give up.
But I think we've...
I think we've cracked
the code.
