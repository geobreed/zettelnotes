China's all over the headlines these days, as its economy recovers faster than the U.S. one. World newspapers trumpet the communist nation's rise, with stories like "Asia recovery show's China's ascendance" and "China to surpass U.S. 'within a decade.'" Analyst David Gordon, head of research at Eurasia Group, says it's true that the Chinese responded to the global recession with a fast, effective stimulus program. The rest is hype, Gordon says, since the China's economy is nowhere near big enough or dynamic enough to save the rest of the world. Plus: Listener Aimee Ennis checks in from her interrupted subdivision in Clover, South Carolina, where the developer is — gasp! — building homes again.

Eric Lane responded to a tale of woe about trying to find treatment for an ear infection with one of his own. Eric wrote:

    I just had a horrible out of network ear infection experience. Driving down to Florida for vacation I got and knew I had to do something. I found an urgent care clinic and they didn't take my coverage so I called my insurance company. They said my only "choice" was a local emergency room. If you have ever been to an emergency room with an earache I can tell you that you feel like a real jerk sitting there next to a guy holding a finger in a bag on ice — especially when you are let in before him (which happened to me on vacation once). I said I didn't want to do that so they said I would have to pay the whole price upfront ($350) and then submit all the paperwork to my insurer. I didn't have $350, so I decided to let it go.

    By the time I hit Savannah I couldn't drive any more. I tried another clinic suggested by my hotel. When I walked in there were tons of people filling out reams of forms. They were all on vacation and out of their coverage areas. Almost single one had to chat with their providers before they went in. The receptionist told me, "Be careful because if you fill out the form wrong your insurer will deny coverage."

    Something is very broken and needs to be fixed.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BEN BERNANKE: Mr. President, I commit today, to you and to the American people, that if confirmed by the Senate, I will work to the utmost of my abilities, with my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and alongside the Congress and the administration, to help provide a solid foundation for growth and prosperity in an environment of price stability.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Today is Wednesday, August 26. And you just heard Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke at the top. He was speaking after President Obama announced he will nominate Bernanke to serve a second term.

DAVIDSON: On the podcast today, we are going to answer the question that I've been hearing a lot lately - is Asia saving the U.S.'s bacon and the rest of the world's in this time of economic uncertainty? But first, Chana, I believe you have in your hands the PLANET MONEY indicator.

JOFFE-WALT: I have it right here. It is 231.

DAVIDSON: Two hundred and thirty-one. That's how many pages of reports the Federal Reserve has been ordered to hand over to Bloomberg News reporters who sued the Fed for refusing to name the financial institutions who took part in 11 government emergency lending programs.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So the Fed had these 11 emergency lending programs, and they had argued that we can't disclose who is getting the money or how much money we're giving out in these programs because that would freak people out. It would cause instability. There might be runs on the institutions. And the whole point of these programs is to add stability. So the Manhattan chief U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska - she decided the case, and she said, nuh-uh (ph). Fed, you have not proven that these banks would be hurt. You are guessing. You're just speculating that this would be bad. She wrote - I have here a quote - "conjecture without evidence of imminent harm simply fails to meet the board's burden of proof."

DAVIDSON: Wow.

JOFFE-WALT: Ouch.

DAVIDSON: I'm going - I like that sentence. Conjecture without evidence of imminent harm. I'm going to use that in my personal life. The Fed has five days to turn over documents to the reporters, so we'll keep an eye out for that. We'll be very excited to find out who these 11 institutions are. Kudos to Bloomberg, I think, right?

JOFFE-WALT: Bloomberg News, yeah. So it's been a big week for the Fed, as you heard at the top there. On Tuesday, President Obama announced he would reappoint Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve.

DAVIDSON: And we had a feeling that was going to happen sometime soon, although there were some rumors that maybe the president would go with a different Fed chairman. But there's absolutely no reason why it would happen this week that we could think of, the week that the president's on vacation. Bernanke's term is still - he still has many months before he has to reappoint.

So that was the first topic in our monthly chat with Eurasia Group. Last month, we talked to the president of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer, about whether America's global influence was on the wane because of this whole financial crisis. This week Ian Bremmer is on vacation, not too far from the president, in Nantucket. So we talked with the head of research at Eurasia Group, David Gordon. And we're going to get to a conversation about Asia that's very interesting. But first, we asked David Gordon, obviously, the reappointment of the Fed chairman is a big deal for the U.S., but there's a whole lot of people around the world who have been paying close attention. And Gordon told us that he thought this announcement had very much an international audience.

DAVID GORDON: I think that Bernanke's respected for what he's done in acting in a way to get us out of the crisis and his proactivity. I actually think, though, that the president has reappointed him and reappointed him now more because of the credibility he has with his promise to roll back these extraordinary measures. And the importance of that is that the U.S. is still and will be dependent on the flow of financial resources from the rest of the world.

DAVIDSON: Right. We borrow - we don't borrow as much as we did two or three years ago...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...But we still borrow a lot from the rest of the world, yeah.

GORDON: Exactly. And the question is, what kind of an interest rate are we going to have to pay? And the danger here is that if the rest of the world doesn't believe that we're going to put our economic and financial house in order successfully, that we're going to be able to withdraw from these extraordinary mechanisms, they're going to demand a higher interest rate on what they give us. It's not that they're going to stop investing, so that's not the danger here. But the danger is that there'll be upward pressure on interest rates. And upward pressure on interest rates would create a real dilemma for the Fed in terms of monetary policy, and that's what the Fed wants to avoid. I think that's what the president wants to avoid. I think the interesting question here is why he did it yesterday...

DAVIDSON: On vacation.

GORDON: ...On vacation. And, you know, my own personal view here - and I don't have any particular evidence for this - but I don't think they planned it this way. But I think this had to do with these reports that are coming out from OMB on the expanding size of the U.S. debt and the U.S. deficit. And I think that's where my hypothesis about Bernanke being reappointed less because of what he's done so far and more from the credibility he has that we're going to unwind this in a way that addresses those debt and deficit challenges.

DAVIDSON: So he's basically - so yesterday, Obama - we thought he was talking to us. He was really talking to about 12 guys around the world. And they probably are mostly guys in China - central - you know, the central bank of China, maybe the central bank in...

GORDON: That's right. A bunch of guys here, too. But, yeah, that he was talking to a global market audience here.

DAVIDSON: There's some guy in an office in China at - what's it called? - SAFE, the...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...State - what is it? I forget. The people who lend us all the money...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Who buy all our bonds. And basically, that guy's, like, nervous.

GORDON: He's nervous. He's worried that the dollar is going to weaken, that there's going to be inflation, that the U.S. is going to inflate its way out of our debt and deficit.

DAVIDSON: Right. And - which is what people have - many governments have done in the past. And so...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...He's thinking, do I buy more euros? Do I - you know, I got all these billions and trillions of dollars I got to keep rolling over. I got to keep buying - basically lending money to different governments. And so we want him to say, OK, dollars are good. I trust the dollar.

GORDON: Yeah. We want him to say I trust - as long as Ben Bernanke's in charge, he has shown me the way that the U.S. is going to walk this back.

DAVIDSON: So you might have been watching the news yesterday and thinking, now who cares? Fed chairman. But it actually was this fascinating global drama, it seems like, where the president was communicating to the Chinese central bank and other central banks around the world to keep buying dollars. As a result, interest rates will be lower. You'll probably pay less on your credit card. You can get a mortgage for less money. It's - it has huge, huge ramifications.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. And so we wanted to actually talk about Asia also with David Gordon because this was this thing that we keep seeing. You know, the question that we had at the top of the podcast - is Asia saving the bacon of the U.S., you know, and the rest of the world while we're in this time of economic uncertainty? And it's one of those things that I keep seeing all these headlines that sort of make sense to me. But I'm thinking, really? Like, I'm just going to read some. "Asia's Recovery Highlights China's Ascendance." "Led by China, Asia Helps The World Out Of Recession." "China To Surpass U.S. Within A Decade." All these headlines, it just - I've just been thinking, you know, is that really true? Is Asia really going to lead the way and become enormous and huge and more enormous than us?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I spent the weekend, Chana, with this friend of mine who's a big investor in China. And he was talking about how incredible this all is. You know, if you just thought five, 10 years ago that there might be a global recession and that China would be leading the world out of the recession, leading the world towards recovery, that that's just remarkable. It wasn't that long ago - I mean, like, a year ago, you know, people were saying if the U.S. consumer just stops shopping, and the U.S. consumer has stopped shopping, then China is going to collapse. People were genuinely saying the factories will stop producing our DVD players and T-shirts. People will lose their jobs. They'll go out on the street and riot. The Chinese communist government will fail. All of China will become a failed state. And that's not what we're seeing. We're seeing the exact opposite.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And we're actually wondering whether they're going to be our heroes to lead us out of this, which is pretty crazy to think about. And, I mean, one thing that I often think is interesting is I feel like - that I have that perception in the U.S., that you hear about China as this huge, unstoppable economic might. And, Adam, you said when you're there, it actually really doesn't feel like that.

DAVIDSON: Not at all. That's really interesting. You know, in the U.S., China is so powerful. In China, there is a real concern. It's like the whole regime, the whole government is held together with some Scotch tape or something and that the whole thing could collapse. And, you know, we in the U.S. - this is the biggest market in the world. And, yes, we are very dependent on borrowing money from China. But basically, if we were cut off from the rest of the world or the rest of the world was in recession, we could survive. We have a big market. There would be an adjustment, it would be painful, but we'd be OK. We could become an island economy, as economists talk about.

So we've come to think of China as totally dependent on us. I mean, they made a decision years ago that we are going to depend on exports to the U.S. And our trade gap with them has fallen, I believe, more than - in half since this recession started. And so how is it - we asked David Gordon, how is it that China has somehow managed this crisis time so well, so much better than anyone expected? He said it's all got to do with stimulus.

GORDON: What happened when the crisis hit is that China faced this immediate crash in export demand. They responded by this overwhelming stimulus package. And when the Chinese do stimulus, they don't do it the way that we do it here. It's planned in the Congress, and then it goes out to the states and then they...

DAVIDSON: It takes years and years to really have an effect.

GORDON: Yeah, they go and it - they announce a stimulus package, and within weeks, there are projects. There are urban projects. There's construction of roads, other infrastructure. There's finances in the banking system that are pushed out into the business community and to consumers, so...

DAVIDSON: It is continually amazing. The lesson China is teaching us is that being a communist dictatorship is a great way to run a capitalist economy.

GORDON: Well, they have - I mean, they have certain benefits, but with certain big costs. So despite all of this, economic growth in China is going to come down in 2009 from something around sort of 10 or 11% per year last year to something closer to 7% this year. So this is not a small hit that they're taking. But...

DAVIDSON: And by the way, I mean, obviously we would kill to have 7% growth. It would be unbelievable.

GORDON: But for them, when they do the math, when they do - and this 8% growth rate that China is always talking about - where that comes from is their calculation of how many jobs have to be created to sustain the natural increase in population plus the rural to urban migration. And it's a mathematical formula. It's very mechanistic. And it leads to 8% growth.

DAVIDSON: And I've heard that 6% would be considered a recession. Six percent positive growth in China...

GORDON: Absolutely.

DAVIDSON: ...Would feel like the economy's slowing down.

GORDON: Exactly, because unemployment would be increasing substantially. That's exactly right. So they've achieved this, and it's no small achievement. But they've achieved it on the back of a set of policies that they know they can't sustain. That is this huge fiscal stimulus. So they've achieved it. It's good. It's also having a positive impact for the world economy. So you're having - elsewhere in Asia, there are also very positive growth stories in Japan, in Korea, Indonesia, Southeast Asia. So they're achieving it. And you've begun to see the pickup in exports even as far away as Europe. France and Germany reported last week that their second quarter economic results, export-driven, were better than suspected.

So it's a good thing for the world economy that the Chinese responded effectively to the crisis. It is creating something of a growth momentum in Asia. Is this going to lead to a global recovery? I think that's an overstatement. I think the fact of the matter is that China is still way too small a part of the world economy - even all of emerging Asia is too small a part of the world economy - and that the basis by which we got from where we were to where we are isn't sustainable. Both of those two things, I think, are sources of real concern.

And you've actually begun to have this debate in China that is beginning to parallel the nascent debate here in the United States of, when do we shift gears here? When do we stop fiscal expansion? When do we stop the flow of money into the banking system? - because part of what's going on here is that when China came into this crisis, I think they had - they sort of hoped for outcome of what the after the crisis was going to look like was a return to the status quo ante.

DAVIDSON: Where Americans are borrowing tons of money and then buying...

GORDON: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Consumer goods made in China.

GORDON: Yeah. And I think they're increasingly realizing that that is not where we're going. That - I mean, and President Obama has been very clear that the U.S. wasn't going to go there. I think he's right. It's - at the end of the day, it's not good for the United States to be in that situation. It's not good for the world economy to be there. But I think the Chinese had hoped that maybe we were going to go back to this. I think there is an increasing recognition in China that we aren't going back.

But because of this, of the political weakness and the political fragility of the Chinese regime, they haven't used their stimulus program to create the basis for a new, more consumer-driven economic model. And so the Chinese are at this very vulnerable point right now of, I think, recognizing that they're probably not going back to the old model, having the tools for the short-term to manage that, fiscal tools. And they could do it for another six to 12 months as well but not really having a plan or a strategy of how to get to a new model that is more domestically driven.

JOFFE-WALT: So they're doing better than us because they did a stimulus, too. But they did it better, faster, bigger and quicker.

GORDON: Part of it is they're doing better than we are largely because they don't have a private banking system that...

JOFFE-WALT: Right.

GORDON: ...Collapsed. So they didn't have any of the domestic financial collapse that we did. They did have a stock market downturn, a very, very large one. But their - they don't have the kind of private financial system that we have in the United States or in Europe that basically froze up during this crisis. So that's one reason they're doing better. A second reason they're doing better is that they're a much poorer country at a much lower level of economic development. And they had just developed a higher growth dynamic anyway based both on this flow - this demography that enabled them to grow but also their strategy of counting on the external markets.

So these are some of the reasons they've done better, but these are also - remember that China's economic growth rate looks great except when you look at their level of savings and investment. And when you look at that compared to growth, investment is very, very, very, very inefficient in China. And what they've done in this downturn - that is, just throw money into the banking system to ensure social stability - has reinforced the inefficiency of investment. So China's not a place that we should be aspiring to copy here.

JOFFE-WALT: But when we see, like, headlines, "Is Asia Going To Lead Us Out Of The Recession?" - in the dream scenario, dream being the best for us, what does that look like? How would that happen?

GORDON: I mean, I think what it would look like would be China beginning to import a lot more of U.S. goods and services and continuing to finance our banking and financial system. And I think there'll be a little bit of both of those. But I don't think that there will be as much of both of those as would be needed to really get a recovery going in both Western Europe and the United States.

Now, that being said, I don't want to suggest for a moment that China achieving substantial rates of economic growth and enabling the rest of Asia to do so isn't a very good thing. It's a very good thing. And I think it's - in some ways it's more - it's been quite important for putting a floor under the real economy, just like Ben Bernanke and other central bankers have put a financial floor under our troubled banks, et cetera. So this is a positive thing. But will it create enough dynamism by itself to lead to a global recovery? There, I'm really dubious.

JOFFE-WALT: It is kind of astounding that we're even asking this question now - is China going to save us from the recession?

GORDON: Yeah. No, it is. And it does reflect a structural shift in the world economy. There's no question that the world economy, the dynamics in the world economy are shifting to Asia. They are shifting to the developing economies. And remember - we shouldn't just be talking about China here. India is also doing quite well. Indonesia is doing well. So there is this structural shift going on. There's no question about that. The structural shift, I believe, does have a benefit for the world economy, but it's one that we are still not in - we aren't yet seeing these economies being large enough and dynamic enough to pull up the rest of the world economy from a deep recession.

DAVIDSON: Now, Chana, one thing I do like to remind people - and I like to remind myself when I get a little anxious - is this is a business cycle. This is going to end. There will be growth again. There will be prosperity and growing prosperity again. We're very confident about that. And the problem right now is it's just hard to figure out where we are. Some days things feel like they're getting better and better, and other days it feels like everything's getting worse and worse.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And some days we hear from all of you out there that you're noticing signs that things are getting better. And some days it seems a little bit less positive. Laura Conaway has been keeping in touch and keeping track of your experiences, and she heard from listener Aimee Ennis at her neighborhood in Clover, S.C. There is a small, positive sign - she and her husband bought their place back in 2007 at the height of the real estate bubble.

DAVIDSON: And they were in this subdivision, which mostly stayed empty. There were very few homes, very few families, very lonely for the Ennises. Aimee says the developer came through in the spring and seeded the red clay lots for grass. We have some pictures that she took on our blog at npr.org/money. And she told Laura Conaway, our own Laura Conaway, that for the longest time it just seemed like nothing would ever change.

AIMEE ENNIS: And then last month, I saw him building a house at the top of one of the cul-de-sacs.

LAURA CONAWAY, BYLINE: That must have been a surprise.

ENNIS: It was. And I thought it was a fluke. And I thought, well, we'll see. Maybe he knew somebody who, you know, wanted a house. You know, it is a small town, and he knows a lot of folks around here. So I thought it's probably just a fluke. But then he started on another one and another one. And then today, I saw him framing up yet a fourth house.

CONAWAY: Wow.

ENNIS: So yeah, I figure he's got some financing, I suppose.

CONAWAY: Can you tell if people are coming and looking at the houses or...

ENNIS: One of them, people just moved into, the first one, which I thought was a fluke because, obviously, people moved into it. So I haven't seen anyone look at the other houses.

CONAWAY: Well, now I guess you get to sit there in your subdivision and watch and see what happens.

ENNIS: Exactly. And I'm keeping my fingers crossed that people come and buy them.

DAVIDSON: You can see on our blog a picture that Aimee Ennis took. She took it right in front of one of the new homes. It reads tax credit. And we assume she's referencing the Obama administration's program that gives first-time homebuyers a tax break of 8,000 bucks, but you got to buy before December of this year. So if you want to move to Clover, S.C., this might be the time.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. Aimee says it reminds her of the Cash for Clunkers program but for homes. So you can see that on our blog, and you can send us your comments and questions to planetmoney@npr.org. We are going to sign off for today. We have - coming up, Adam, you have an interview with Barney Frank that we're going to try to get on as early as possible on Friday's podcast.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. So tune in early on Friday. We're going to try and get that up as soon as possible because Barney Frank - I don't know if people know this - he is the scariest, funniest...

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: ...Most awesome interview just because he is - it's just always entertaining.

JOFFE-WALT: All right.

DAVIDSON: And terrifying.

JOFFE-WALT: All right. We will listen for that. For now, I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
Mr. President, I commit today to you and to the American people that if confirmed by the
Senate, I will work to the utmost of my abilities with my colleagues at the Federal Reserve
and alongside the Congress and the administration to help provide a solid foundation for growth
and prosperity in an environment of price stability.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Khanna Jaffe-Walt. Today is Wednesday, August 26th. And you just heard Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben Bernanke at the top. He was speaking after President Obama announced
he will nominate Bernanke to serve a second term.
On the podcast today, we are going to answer the question that I've been hearing a lot
Is Asia saving the U.S.'s bacon and the rest of the world's in this time of economic uncertainty?
But first, Khanna, I believe you have in your hands the planet money indicator.
I have it right here. It is two, three, one.
Two hundred and thirty one. That's how many pages of reports the Federal Reserve
has been ordered to hand over to Bloomberg News reporters who sued the Fed for refusing
to name the financial institutions who took part in 11 government emergency lending programs.
Right. So the Fed had these 11 emergency lending programs and they had argued that
we can't disclose who is getting the money or how much money we're giving out in these
programs because that would freak people out, would cause instability. There might
be runs on the institutions and the whole point of these programs is to add stability.
So the Manhattan Chief U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, she decided the case and
she said, no, Fed, you have not proven that these banks would be hurt. You are guessing.
You're just speculating that this would be bad. She wrote, I have here a quote,
conjecture without evidence of imminent harm simply fails to meet the board's burden
of proof.
Wow.
Ouch.
I like that sentence. Conjecture without evidence of imminent harm. I'm going to
use that in my personal life. The Fed has five days to turn over documents to the reporters.
So we'll keep an eye out for that. We'll be very excited to find out who these 11
institutions are. Kudos to Bloomberg, I think.
Bloomberg News. Yeah. So has it been a big week for the Fed? As you heard at
the top there, on Tuesday, President Obama announced he would reappoint Bernanke as
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
And we had a feeling that was going to happen sometime soon, although there was
some rumors that maybe the president would go with a different Fed chairman.
But there's absolutely no reason why it would happen this week that we could think of,
the week that the president's on vacation. Bernanke's term is still, he still has many
months before he has to reappoint. So that was the first topic in our monthly chat with
Eurasia Group. Last month we talked to the president of Eurasia Group, Ian Bremmer,
about whether America's global influence was on the wane because of this whole
financial crisis. This week Ian Bremmer is on vacation, not too far from the
president in Nantucket. So we talked with the head of research at Eurasia Group,
David Gordon. And we're going to get to a conversation about Asia. That's very
interesting. But first we asked David Gordon, obviously the reappointment of
the Fed chairman is a big deal for the U.S., but there's a whole lot of
people around the world who have been paying close attention. And Gordon
told us that he thought this announcement had very much an international
audience. I think that Bernanke's respected for what he's done in acting in a way to
get us out of the crisis and his proactivity. I actually think, though,
that the president has reappointed him and reappointed him now more because
of the credibility he has with his promise to roll back these

three years ago, but we still borrow a lot from the rest of the world. Exactly, and the question is what kind of an

that if the rest of the world doesn't believe that we're going to put our
economic and financial house in order successfully, that we're going to be
able to withdraw from these extraordinary mechanisms, they're
going to demand a higher interest rate on what they give us. It's not that
they're going to stop investing. So that's not the danger here,
but the danger is that there'll be upward pressure on interest rates and
upward pressure on interest rates would create a real dilemma for the Fed in
terms of monetary policy, and that's what the Fed wants to avoid. I think
that's what the President wants to avoid. I think the interesting question
here is why he did it yesterday, on vacation, and you know, my own
personal view here. I don't have any particular evidence for this, but I
don't think they planned it this way, but I think this had to do with
these reports that are coming out from OMB on the the expanding size
of the U.S. debt and the U.S. deficit, and I think that's where my
hypothesis about Bernanke being reappointed less because of what he's

challenges. So yesterday, Obama, we thought he was talking to us. He was
really talking to about 12 guys around the world, and they probably are
mostly guys in China, the Central Bank of China, maybe Central Bank.
Yeah, that's right. A bunch of guys here too, but yeah, that he was
talking to a global market audience here. There's some guy in an office
in China at what's it called, SAFE, the state, what is it I forget, the
people who lend us all the money, who buy all our bonds, and basically that
guy's like nervous. He's nervous. He's worried that the dollar is going to
weaken, that there's going to be inflation, that the U.S. is going to
inflate its way out of our debt and deficit. Right, and which is
what people of many governments have done in the past, and so he's
thinking, do I buy more euros? Do I, you know, I got all these billions and
trillions dollars I got to keep rolling over, I got to keep buying, basically
lending money to different governments, and so we want him to say, okay,
dollars are good. I trust the dollar. Yeah, we want him to say, I trust as
long as Ben Bernanke's in charge, he has shown me the way that the U.S.
is going to walk this back. So you might have been watching the news
yesterday and thinking, oh, who cares, Fed Chairman, but it actually
was this fascinating global drama, it seems like, where the president was
communicating to the Chinese central bank and other central banks around
the world to keep buying dollars. As a result, interest rates will be
lower. You'll probably pay less on your credit card. You can get a
mortgage for less money. It has huge, huge ramifications.
Yeah, and so we wanted to actually talk about Asia also with David
Gordon, because this was this thing that we keep seeing, you know,
the question that we had at the top of the podcast, is Asia saving the
bacon of the U.S. and the rest of the world while we're in this time
of economic uncertainty? And it's one of those things that I keep seeing
all these headlines that sort of make sense to me, but I'm thinking
really like, I'm just going to read some. Asia's recovery highlights
China's ascendance led by China. Asia helps the world out of
recession. China to surpass U.S. within a decade. All these
headlines, I've just been thinking, you know, is that really
true? Is Asia really going to lead the way and become enormous and
huge and more enormous than us?
Yeah, I spent the weekend, Hanna, with this friend of mine who's a
big investor in China. And he was talking about how incredible this
all is that, you know, if you just thought five, 10 years ago
that there might be a global recession and that China would be
leading the world out of the recession, leading the world towards
recovery, that that's just remarkable. It wasn't that long ago.
I mean, like a year ago, two, you know, people were saying if the
U.S. consumer just stops shopping and the U.S. consumer has stopped
shopping, then China is going to collapse. People were genuinely
saying that the factories will stop producing our DVD players and
T-shirts. People will lose their jobs. They'll go out on the
street and riot. The Chinese communist government will fail. All
of China will become a failed state. And that's not what we're
seeing. We're seeing the exact opposite.
Right. And we're actually wondering whether they're going to
be our heroes to lead us out of this, which is pretty crazy to
think about. And I mean, one thing that I often think is
interesting is I feel like that I have that perception in the
U.S. that you hear about China as this huge, unstoppable
economic might. And Adam, you said when you're there, it
actually really doesn't feel like that.
Not at all. It's really interesting. Yeah. In the U.S.,
China is so powerful. In China, there is a real concern. It's
like the whole regime, the whole government is held
together with some scotch tape or something, and that the
whole thing could collapse. And, you know, we in the U.S.,
this is the biggest market in the world. And yes, we are
very dependent on borrowing money from China. But basically,
if we were cut off from the rest of the world, or the
rest of the world was in recession, we could survive. We
have a big market. There'd be an adjustment. It would be
painful, but we'd be okay. We could become an island
economy, as economists talk about. So we've come to think
of China as totally dependent on us. I mean, they made a
decision years ago that we are going to depend on exports
to the U.S., and our trade gap with them has fallen, I
believe, more than in half since this recession started.
And so how is it, we asked David Gordon, how is it that
China has somehow managed this crisis time so well, so
much better than anyone expected? He said it's all got
to do with stimulus.
What happened when the crisis hit is that China faced this
immediate crash in export demand. They responded by this
overwhelming stimulus package. And when the Chinese do
stimulus, they don't do it the way that we do it here, if
it's planned in the Congress, and then it goes out to the
states, and then they-
It takes years and years to really have an effect.
They go and they announce a stimulus package, and within
weeks, there are projects, there are urban projects, there's
construction of roads, other infrastructure, there's
finances in the banking system that are pushed out into the
business community, into consumers.
It is continually amazing, the lesson China is teaching us
is that being a communist dictatorship is a great way
to run a capitalist economy.
Well, they have, I mean, they have certain benefits, but
with certain big costs. So despite all of this, economic
growth in China is going to come down in 2009 from
something around sort of 10 or 11% per year last year to
something closer to 7% this year. So this is not a small
hit that they're taking.
And by the way, I mean, obviously, we would kill to
have 7% growth, it would be unbelievable.
For them, when they do the math, when they do, and this
8% growth rate that China is always talking about, where
that comes from is their calculation of how many jobs
have to be created to sustain the natural increase in
population plus the rural to urban migration.
And it's a mathematical formula, it's very
mechanistic, and it leads to 8% growth.
And I've heard that 6% would be considered a recession,
6% positive growth in China would feel like the economy
slowing down.
Exactly, because unemployment would be increasing
substantially. That's exactly right. So they've achieved
this, and it's no small achievement, but they've
achieved it on the back of a set of policies that
they know they can't sustain. That is this huge
fiscal stimulus. So they've achieved it. It's good.
It's also having a positive impact for the world
economy. So you're having elsewhere in Asia, there
are also very positive growth stories in Japan, in
Korea, Indonesia, Southeast Asia. So they're
achieving it. And you've begun to see the pickup in
exports even as far away as Europe. France and
Germany reported last week that their second
quarter economic results, export driven, were
better than suspected. So it's a good thing for
the world economy that the Chinese responded
effectively to the crisis. It is creating
something of a growth momentum in Asia. Is this
going to lead to a global recovery? I think
that's an overstatement. I think the fact of
the matter is that that China is still way too
small a part of the world economy, even all of
emerging Asia is too small a part of the
world economy, and that the basis by which we
got from where we were to where we are isn't
sustainable. Both of those two things, I
think, are sources of real concern. And you've
actually begun to have this debate in China
that is beginning to parallel the nascent
debate here in the United States of when do we
when do we shift gears here? When do we stop
fiscal expansion? When do we stop the flow of
money into the banking system? Because part of
what's going on here is that when when
China came into this crisis, I think they
had they're sort of hoped for outcome of
what the after the crisis was going to look
like, was a return to the status quo ante
where Americans are borrowing tons of money
and then buying goods made in China. Yeah.
And I think they're increasingly realizing
that that is not where we're going. That
I mean, and President Obama has been very
clear that the US wasn't going to go there. I
think he's right. It's at the end of the
day, it's not good for the United States to
be in that situation. It's not good for the
world economy to be there. But I think the
Chinese had had hoped that maybe we were
going going to go back to this. I think
there's there is an increasing recognition
in China that we aren't going back. But
because of this of the the political
weakness and the political fragility of the
Chinese regime, they haven't used their
stimulus program to create the basis for a
new more consumer driven economic model. And
so the Chinese are at this very vulnerable
point right now of I think recognizing
that they're probably not going back to
the old model, having the tools for the
short term to manage that fiscal tools
and they could do it for another six to
12 months as well. But not really having a
plan or a strategy of how to get to a new
model that is more domestically driven.
So so they're doing they're doing better
than us because they did a stimulus to but
they did it better, faster, bigger and
quicker.
Part of it is they're doing better than
we are, largely because they don't have a
private banking system that collapse. So
they didn't have any of the domestic
financial collapse that we did. They did
have a stock market down to a very, very
large one. But there, they don't have
the kind of private financial system that
we have in the United States, or in
Europe, that basically froze up during
this crisis. So that's one reason
they're doing better. A second reason
they're doing better is that they're a
much poorer country at a much lower
level of economic development. And they
had just developed a higher growth dynamic
anyway, based both on this flow, this
demography that enabled them to grow,
but also their strategy of counting on
the external markets. So these are some
of the reasons they've done better. But
these are also remember that, that
China, China's economic growth rate
looks great, except when you look at
their level of savings and investment.
And, and when you look at that
compared to growth, investment is
very, very, very, very inefficient in
China. And what they've done in this
downturn, that is just throw money
into the banking system to ensure
social stability has reinforced the
inefficiency of investment. So China's
not a place that that we should be
aspiring to copy here.
But when we see like headlines, is
Asia going to lead us out of the
recession in the dream scenario dream
being the best for us? What does that
look like? How would that happen?
I mean, I think what it would look
like would be China beginning to
import a lot more of US goods and
services. And I, and continuing to
finance our banking and financial
system. And I think there'll be a
little bit of both of those. But I
don't think that there will be as
much of both of those as would be
needed to, to really get a recovery
going in both Western Europe and the
United States. Now, that being said,
I, I don't want to suggest for a
moment that that China achieving
substantial rates of economic growth
and enabling the rest of Asia to do
so isn't a very good thing. It's a
very good thing. And I think it's in
some ways, it's more, it's been
quite important for putting a floor
under the real economy, just like
Ben Bernanke and other central
bankers have put a financial floor
under our troubled banks, etc. So this
is a positive thing. But will it
create enough dynamism by itself to
lead to a global recovery? There,
I'm really dubious.
It is kind of astounding that we're
even asking this question now. Is
China going to save us from the
recession?
Yeah, no, it is. And it does
reflect a structural shift in the
world economy. There's no question
that the world economy, the
dynamics in the world economy are
shifting to Asia. They're shifting to
the developing economies. And remember,
we shouldn't just be talking about
China here. India is also doing
quite well. Indonesia is doing
well. So there is this structural
shift going on. There's no question
about that. The structural shift, I
believe, does have a benefit for the
world economy. But it's one that we
are still not in. We aren't yet
seeing these economies being large
enough and dynamic enough to pull
up the rest of the world economy
from a deep recession.
Now, Hannah, one thing I do like
to remind people, and I like to
remind myself when I get a little
anxious, is this is a business
cycle. This is going to end. There
will be growth again. There will be
prosperity and growing prosperity
again. We're very confident about
that. And the problem right now is
it's just hard to figure out where
we are. Some days things feel like
they're getting better and better.
And other days, it feels like
everything's getting worse and
worse.
Right. And some days we hear from
all of you out there that you're
noticing signs that things are
getting better. And some days it
seems a little bit less positive.
Laura Conaway has been keeping in
touch and keeping track of your
experiences. And she heard from
listener Amy Ennis that her
neighborhood in Clover, South
Carolina, there is a small
positive sign. She and her husband
bought their place back in 2007
at the height of the real estate
bubble.
And they were in this subdivision
which mostly stayed empty. There
were very few homes, very few
families, very lonely for the
Ennis's. Amy says the
developer came through in the
spring and seeded the red
clay lots for grass. We have
some pictures that she took on
our blog at npr.org slash money.
And she told Laura Conaway, our
own Laura Conaway, that for the
longest time it just seemed like
nothing would ever change.
And then last month I saw him
building a house at the top of
one of the cul-de-sacs.
That must have been a
surprise.
It was. And I thought it was a
fluke. And I thought, well,
well, we'll see. Maybe he knew
somebody who, you know, wanted
a house. You know, it is a
small town and he knows a lot
of folks around here. So I
thought it's probably just a
fluke. But then he started on
another one and another one.
And then today I saw him
framing up yet a fourth house.
Wow. So, yeah, I figure he's
got some financing, I
suppose.
Can you tell if people are
coming and looking at the
houses or?
One of them, one of them
people just moved into the
first one, which I thought
was a fluke because
obviously people moved into
it. So I haven't seen anyone
look at the other houses.
Well, now I guess you get to
sit there in your subdivision
and watch and see what
happens.
Exactly. And I'm keeping my
fingers crossed that people
come and buy them.
You can see on our blog a
picture that Amy Ennis took.
She she took it right in
front of one of the new
homes that reads tax credit.
And we assume she's
referencing the Obama
administration's program that
gives first time home buyers
a tax break of eight thousand
bucks. But you got to buy
before December of this
year. So if you want to move
to Clover, Clover, South
Carolina, this might be the
time.
Amy says it reminds her of
the cash for clunkers
program, but for homes.
So you can see that on our
blog and you can send us your
comments and questions to
planetmoney at NPR dot
org. We are going to sign
off for today.
We have coming up.
Adam, you have an interview
with Barney Frank that we're
going to try to get on as
early as possible on
Friday's podcast.
Yeah. So tune in early on
Friday. We're going to try
and get that up as soon as
possible, because Barney
Frank, I don't know if
people know this, he is the
scariest, funniest, most
awesome interview just
because he is.
It's just always entertaining
and terrifying.
All right. We will listen
for that for now.
I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
Thank you for listening.
