On today's Planet Money: Rich nations and developing ones in the G20 got together in Pittsburgh this week to discuss the fate of the world. Also, how to fix it. Among the key issues was how to give emerging markets a meaningful seat at the table. For starters, the G20 will now replace the G8, which includes only leading nations. David Gordon, head of research at Eurasia Group, says that's a start, a small one. Meanwhile, NPR's Scott Horsley ventured out past the protesters in search of an alternative G20 scene.

The Planet Money crew will be on This American Life over the weekend. As part of our one-year anniversary, we're taking a look back at some of the people in our original Giant Pool of Money episode to see how the economic crisis has changed their lives.

Among them is "subprime guy" Glen Pizzolorusso, who blogged this week about how he lost everything and found a new definition of success.

Some of wrote back to say that Pizzolorusso didn't sound all that sorry about what his role in the mortgage catastrophe. And then there was Dee Whitten, who wins the prize for comment of the week with:

    I was in the business and the borrowers who let this happen were the ones who were conducting the "Fraud" most of the time. We had the subprime products but they were the ones who wanted that house so badly that they botched their own documents to make it seem like they had more money....have you ever seen doctored bank statements? or doctored w2's...I bet you have, because they're everywhere.

    Was it the banks fault yes and I agree with you there and respect your opinions. We had the product; the 2 year [adjustable rate mortgage] that started to adjust in the third year that most had a problem with. On paper they qualified and the loan officers or "brokers" sent us, the wholesale companies all the documents for us to verify.

    It's not all the bank's fault and you have to see that side of it too.

Because seriously, people, throughout this premiere year, you've proved every day that Planet Money is a place where a mortgage broker can say he's been humbled, a preacher can talk about atonement, and another mortgage insider can stand up for the first guy. Thank you, one and all.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TIMOTHY GEITHNER: The objective of this framework is to make sure that countries come together at an early stage and make sure that the collective policies they're pursuing are not going to lead to unsustainable imbalances, are going to make sure we're less vulnerable to future cycles of booms and busts.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOP TWENTY")

THE UNDERTONES: (Singing) Talking on the telephone. The boys won't leave the girls alone. So what are you going to do now? Hey, hey, hey. Top, top 20. Oh, no. Top, top 20. Oh, no. Top, top 20. Oh, no.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson. Very excited to have a special guest co-host.

CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST:

Hello. Caitlin Kenney, PLANET MONEY'S producer in front of the mic today instead of behind. Today is Friday, September 25. That was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner you heard at the top talking about the B-20. I mean, G-20. And - anyway, that's the subject of today's podcast.

But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator.

DAVIDSON: The indicator, Caitlin, is a strange one today because it is not a number. It's a sentence.

KENNEY: Weird.

DAVIDSON: Or technically, it's a sentence fragment. It is the words greater force than is customary.

KENNEY: Those are the words of Kevin Warsh. And Adam tells me they may be the five most important words to the world economy spoken this year. Big deal.

DAVIDSON: It's a big deal because Kevin Warsh is a Federal Reserve governor. He's known to be a very close adviser to Ben Bernanke.

And he gave a speech today in Chicago that you can be sure investors and central bankers and policy watchers all over the world will be studying carefully because he said basically that the Fed is probably going to raise their core Fed funds interest rate before people think they will - and, as he said, with greater force than is customary.

KENNEY: So I know you speak central banker, but I'm still learning. And I think what he's saying is that Alan Greenspan screwed up.

DAVIDSON: That is exactly what he's saying, Caitlin.

KENNEY: Yes.

DAVIDSON: He's saying that this whole housing bubble, the whole bubble bursting, the crisis happened in large part because Greenspan kept interest rates way too low for way too long. So he said, this time, the Fed learned its lesson. And sooner than you think, they will raise rates fast.

KENNEY: Which means businesses and consumers and everyone will have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money, which will slow the economy down a bit. We have no idea when or how much, but we know it'll be more and faster than we thought.

DAVIDSON: All right. So moving on to topic No. 2, the G-20 summit. The leaders of the 20 richest nations in the world are in Pittsburgh this week having a meeting. When you have a meeting with the 20 leaders of the 20 richest nations in the world, you have to give it a cool name, so they call it the G-20.

KENNEY: So creative.

DAVIDSON: It's very creative. I think G stands for government.

KENNEY: Oh.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Now, we used to hear a lot about the G-7 or the G-8. The way I think about it is, G-7, those are countries you're going to visit. You're not going to worry that much about what you bring because you don't need, like, anti-malaria medicine.

KENNEY: You can find a way for your cellphone to work.

DAVIDSON: Your cellphone's going to work. You're going to have an ATM card. You know, we're talking about U.S., U.K., you know, Japan - rich, rich countries - Germany, China. But the G-20, you start bringing in countries that have rich parts and really, really poor parts - Brazil, India, Turkey - countries where you can have a real first-world experience or you can have a more developing-world experience. And you might be a little nervous about the, you know, hospital system, that kind of thing.

But the G-20 is meeting now to discuss a whole range of economic issues. Obviously, first and foremost among them, the future of financial market regulation. But the big news is they're saying that the G-20, the bigger group, they are now the central body. That's the main group to decide how the world economy works. No longer is it the G-8.

KENNEY: More people at the party.

DAVIDSON: Exactly.

KENNEY: Of course, some people have been saying they should do this for a while now. The White House said today this decision brings to the table the countries needed to build a stronger, more balanced global economy, reform the financial system and lift the lives of the poorest.

DAVIDSON: Sounds like a natural thing to do. We checked in with our friends at Eurasia Group, the political economy consulting group, to see what they have to say about all this. I talked to David Gordon, he's the head of research at Eurasia Group, and asked him to remind us what the G-7, G-8 was to begin with.

DAVID GORDON: The G-7, G-8, when it began, I think about 30 or 35 years ago, it began as the G-5, I believe. And it was really the first effort to really do serious macroeconomic coordination, policy coordination among the world's leading economies.

But it hasn't really had a major economic policy coordination role, really for, I'd say, a good 20 years. So I think this effort to basically displace the G-7, G-8 with the G-20 is, first of all, I think, well-intentioned. This is the right thing to do. The G-7, G-8 construct was too narrow a set of countries to have around the table. And I think the danger here was that you were going to have both of these things alive at the same time. And I think the concern on the Obama administration was that this would just take up literally too much high-level time and effort and be redundant. So I give them credit, and I give the G-20 credit for really saying, this is it. We're no longer going to do the G-7, G-8, it's going to be the G-20. That said, how much actual real coordination and collaboration you get out of it is an open question.

I think it's a useful instrument for having discussions, for clarifying issues, for raising issues. But this is a very disparate set of countries. And I think if it was hard to get coordination among the G-7, it's going to be much harder to get it among the G-20. But it doesn't mean that it's not a useful thing to do once or twice a year, to have this particular set of leaders meet, interact, talk about both big financial and economic issues and larger issues that face the world at large.

DAVIDSON: So before, say - the mid-1970s...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...We had the Bretton Woods system. We had a gold standard.

GORDON: That's right.

DAVIDSON: And that really was some firm rules that...

GORDON: That's right.

DAVIDSON: ...Created - those were some firm rules that defined global international economic cooperation activity.

GORDON: Yeah. And the U.S. was still by far the dominant actor on the scene. So that combination of a structured system, firm rules and a real...

DAVIDSON: G-1.

GORDON: ...G-1, that was the world before the creation of the G-5, what became the G-7, that's right.

DAVIDSON: Because we started having - I mean, Europe, post-Marshall Plan becoming, obviously, a power, Japan...

GORDON: That's right.

DAVIDSON: ...Hurtling on the stage.

GORDON: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And then eventually, of course, Russia...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Became capitalist and China, obviously, we're hearing about them - and India and Brazil. And - but what we have is a - we have a lot more players. We have a much more chaotic, less structured global economy. Is that fair?

GORDON: Much more chaotic and much less structured. And I think in the aftermath of the financial crisis, that becomes even more so. Because what the financial crisis does is it really undermines the legitimacy and the influence of the U.S. financial model and of inherent U.S. leadership in this whole system. And so I think we're heading into a world that just has a lot more economic diversity in it. And the high tide of free market reforms that we've seen in the last 25 or 30 years is really now ebbing. And we're going to have a more diverse world. That's why I think this is a good thing, even if it doesn't lead to a lot of coordination, that getting these diverse voices, engaging in a periodic way will be useful. But expectations of actual concrete achievements, I think, have to be kept modest.

DAVIDSON: So there's never been more of a need for something like the G-20 to coordinate the global economy. And it's never been less likely that they could actually coordinate the global economy.

GORDON: Yeah, I think that's right. I think actual coordination of the global economy is an expectation too far. So the need is that you have a forum in which the leaders can talk about issues, can engage in debates, can see - can begin to move towards consensus, if possible, can highlight areas of concern in which caution has to be taken. And I think that's going to be, really, the role of the G-20. I think that the first two meetings - the meeting at the end of last year that President Bush hosted, and then the meeting in April that Prime Minister Gordon Brown hosted - those were in some ways exceptions because those were really crisis driven events. Whereas, what we're seeing now, I think is likely to be the transition meeting towards a more institutionalized, more normal set of meetings among the leaders.

DAVIDSON: All right, David, thank you so much. And this will be something for us at PLANET MONEY to pay a lot of attention to. I know, obviously, Eurasia Group, this will be a major issue for you guys as well.

GORDON: Yes.

DAVIDSON: And we'll be talking about it throughout the coming years. Because I think, for me, this is one of the most fascinating things about where we are. I mean, if you look at modern financial history, you have these periods of a firm gold standard. You have...

GORDON: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Sort of the defining, you know, Soviet-U.S...

GORDON: Yes, that's right.

DAVIDSON: ...World. And now we have this...

GORDON: We're in a very transitional world.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah. There are no clear rules.

GORDON: That's right, yeah.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

GORDON: No, it's fascinating world. And that lack of explicit structure happens at the national level, but it also happens at the global level. And that's what these leaders are trying to grapple with.

DAVIDSON: So, Caitlin, I have to say, the G-20 - covering the G-20 meeting, this is an assignment, like, I've been asked a few times - like Adam, why don't you go cover the G20? And I always try and avoid it because as a reporter like you can't - yes, there's big important things happening in some room that you can't get to even with your press pass. You're like...

KENNEY: It's all blocked off and...

DAVIDSON: It's all blocked off, yeah. You're just waiting for a press conference or a press release. And I mean, even when it was in Moscow or, you know, lots of cool countries, I didn't want to go. And now, it's in Pittsburgh? Which...

KENNEY: What do you have against Pittsburgh?

DAVIDSON: No, I mean, I've been there. I like it. It's a perfectly nice city, but I'm not like, dying to get myself to Pittsburgh. You know what I mean?

KENNEY: Clearly, you've never had a sandwich at Primanti Brothers.

DAVIDSON: No, I never - what - no, I haven't.

KENNEY: Well, maybe if you'd had one, it would change your mind, just saying.

DAVIDSON: They're really good?

KENNEY: Yeah. Amazing.

DAVIDSON: All right. I'm convinced. You know what? I'm going to go to the airport right now. I'm going to go to Pittsburgh. I'm going to cover the G-20.

KENNEY: Too late. NPR already sent Scott Horsley.

DAVIDSON: And, of course, I knew that because you and I, Caitlin, talked to Scott earlier this morning.

KENNEY: That's right. Scott Horsley is, of course, NPR's White House correspondent. We talked to him earlier today about what it's like to be there.

DAVIDSON: So, Scott, you are in Pittsburgh. You are just one of the many important people who are in Pittsburgh right now.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: (Laughter) Yes. Far down on the pecking order, for sure.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. So who's there? I mean, I think everybody knows what's going on, but just tell us what's going on.

HORSLEY: Well, there are leaders of the G-20 countries here. That's the 20 biggest industrial and developing nations. And they're here to talk about how to head off financial crises - like the one that we're hopefully now coming out of - and to put the world's economy on a more sustainable growth trajectory. This is a very sophisticated gathering.

DAVIDSON: I can imagine. Which leads me to believe that you got as far away from that gathering as possible. I do - I want to say for years now, when I was international economics correspondent, every year when there was a G-20 meeting, you know, I would think, oh, I should go. And then I would always find an excuse not to go because I just pictured myself sitting in some hotel conference room with a hundred other reporters watching really boring speeches on TV, being nowhere near...

HORSLEY: We don't actually watch the speeches.

DAVIDSON: You don't, OK. But it is pretty...

HORSLEY: But otherwise, that's a pretty accurate description.

DAVIDSON: It's just you and a bunch of reporters sitting around.

HORSLEY: That's right. And somewhere nearby here, momentous economic decisions are being made.

DAVIDSON: So what do you do when you are a reporter in Pittsburgh, there's the 20 most powerful people in the world sitting around talking, and you have no access to them.

HORSLEY: What I tried to do, Adam, was really go to somebody who had an overview of this G-20 summit, someone who could sort of give you the big picture, the whole international scope. So I wound up at the Church Brew Works. That's a historic church on Liberty Avenue here in Pittsburgh that has been refashioned as a brew pub. And that's where they cooked up something called the B-20. It's a beer made with ingredients from many, if not all, of the G-20 nations. Now, you can imagine this is an enormously complicated, in-depth task that involves lots of frameworks and timetables to come up with something like that. At least you'd think that'd be the case. But master brewer Brant Dubovick told me it really was not all that formal.

BRANT DUBOVICK: We sort of just winged it and got a list of spices and chief exports to the countries of the G-20. We came up with 14 good ones that we could get commonly everywhere, went down to Penzey's Spices, got everything, played around with it a little bit to see what it would taste like. And I just went with it and brewed a seven-barrel batch.

HORSLEY: By the way, that's 31 gallons to the barrel. So they made about 256 gallons of this B-20 brew. And I got to taste some of it. It's not bad.

KENNEY: So what are some of the spices in there that he was talking about, the 14?

HORSLEY: Well, some of them are, you know, hops and malt, the kind of stuff you would expect it to be in beer - hops and malt from Canada, Britain or whatnot. But there was also charnushka from India. That's the black seeds that give garam masala its flavor. They're also the black seeds on Jewish rye bread, which is kind of an interesting note. Turkey supplied something called mahaleb, which is made from the pits of sour cherries. Have you ever had sour cherry pit beer before?

DAVIDSON: No.

KENNEY: I don't think so.

HORSLEY: But brewmaster Dubovick, you know, he mentioned that they tried to get the major exports of these different countries represented. And that's kind of central because exports and imports are a big part of what the G-20 is all about. Part of putting that economy on a more sustainable growth path is to try to have a more balance so you don't have some countries like the U.S. saving too little and importing too much, and other countries - like China, for example - exporting too much and saving too much. They're trying to have a more balanced economy. And balance, turns out, is something that brewmaster Dubovick knows a lot about.

DUBOVICK: Without balance, the beer could actually just go to one side. If you're using too many hops, all you're going to get is that hop bitterness. If you're using too much malt, you're just going to get too much of the malt. So we definitely strive for a balance in everything we brew here.

DAVIDSON: Now, Scott, I don't know if you know this, but PLANET MONEY'S own Caitlin Kenney is a newly christened brewmaster herself.

KENNEY: It's true. I've been homebrewing. And it's...

DAVIDSON: And bringing it in, it's been delicious.

KENNEY: Thank you. And it's very true what he says about the hops and the malt. Really, balances the key. You don't want to prominent of one flavor when your brewing.

HORSLEY: Have you tried brewing garam masala beer?

KENNEY: No, I haven't. But as soon as you said that, I was like, I have some of that home in my cupboard.

DAVIDSON: So what - tell me what it tasted like. Did it taste in balance? Did it tastes like the ideal global economy, in which there's not huge trade gaps, trade deficits, trade surpluses?

HORSLEY: Well, it tasted good. It was - it's kind of heavy. It's sort of a heavy English brown ale. It was a lot of alcohol, about 7% alcohol. But yeah, it wasn't too sweet, wasn't too hoppy. It - they did not actually manage to get all 20 countries represented. Apparently, the - some of the Islamic countries were not eager to participate in this little brewing experience.

DAVIDSON: Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, yeah.

HORSLEY: Although Indonesia, of course - the world's most populous Islamic country - apparently had no problem supplying jackfruit. So it's got jackfruit in the B-20 beer, buckwheat from Russia, pumpkin from right here in the US-of-A.

DAVIDSON: Pumpkin was the U.S. thing?

HORSLEY: Well, pumpkin and Chinook hops.

DAVIDSON: Really? And did it tastes like beer? Did it taste like some weird soup?

HORSLEY: No, it absolutely tasted like beer.

DAVIDSON: Wow. So...

HORSLEY: And I think that's - you know, there's a lesson for that. We can all get along within the brewer's vat.

DAVIDSON: I will just think of the taste of the B-20 whenever I think about global discord. So Scott, I guess the - is the big news out of the G-20 that now we're moving from a world where the G-7 or the G-8 - in other words, the seven or eight richest countries in the world - make the key decisions about the world economy. Now, we're adding 13 or 12 countries. And the G-20 is going to be the main body. Can you explain what that difference is?

HORSLEY: That's right. We have now had an agreement by the members of the G-20 that this, going forward, will be the go-to body for international economic cooperation. Now, you could say in some sense that's just a recognition of the world as it is today, because major fast-growing economies like China and India and Brazil exist somewhere between eight and 20. And they were not included when the G-8 was meeting. So to say that now the G-20 will be the go-to body is just really to say we're moving the economic cooperation into the 21st century and recognizing, hey, there's billions of people out there that we need to take account of.

I remember after the G-8 summit in L'Aquila, Italy, earlier this year, President Obama was asked about what's the right size international body to have these kinds of meetings - because obviously the more countries that are included, it does get more unwieldy. It's a little bit more difficult. But they want to have representation from a broad swath of the economic might out there in the world. And the president said, you know, whatever place - whatever rank your country is in, that's what you think ought to be the size. So if you're the 15th largest economy, you want to have the G-15.

DAVIDSON: Right. If you're the 68th, you want the G-68.

HORSLEY: Why isn't it the G-68? Absolutely.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

HORSLEY: It's kind of like the - what we used to call the big three automakers.

DAVIDSON: Right. Now, when I heard this announcement, I - my - the cynic in me said, oh, so now when there's some meaningless, vague statement of international cooperation that doesn't actually change anything, it's not going to be seven or eight guys in suits standing there making it. It's going to be 20.

HORSLEY: That's right. And it may be all the more vague and meaningless in order to get consensus among the 20. But to the extent that they are making meaningful moves, obviously, you want to have those major developing countries included.

KENNEY: Man, you guys are really cynical.

DAVIDSON: You have not covered enough bureaucratic government press conferences, I think.

KENNEY: That's true.

DAVIDSON: That does suck the soul out of you.

KENNEY: You know what, though? All that talk about beer really made me thirsty.

DAVIDSON: I got to say, I've been picturing all day, in my taste memory, the - really amazing beers you brought in. I was under the impression that would be a regular thing. Maybe Friday afternoons you'd always...

KENNEY: Well, you - I don't know if you've noticed, I've been a little busy here. On top of my regular job, you guys have me filling in, hosting this podcast, and I haven't really had time.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, you love it.

KENNEY: Yeah. I know, it's fun. But let's get out of here so I can go home and brew some more.

DAVIDSON: OK. so that's going to be it for us today. Please visit our blog, npr.org/money. We have this great essay there from Glen Pizzolorusso. Fans of our story, "The Giant Pool Of Money" may remember him. He was the guy who partied with the B-list celebrities.

KENNEY: Tara Reid, Cuba Gooding Jr...

DAVIDSON: ...The kid from "Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive." And he talks about how losing millions of dollars has actually changed his life dramatically.

KENNEY: And you can hear more from Glen and a bunch of the other people in that piece on "This American Life" this weekend. Right, Adam? You guys have a big show coming up.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, actually, Alex is at work right now finishing the touches. I recorded the tracks yesterday. It's basically half of the original "Giant Pool Of Money." And then half of the hour will be us catching up with people. You've heard some of that on the podcast, but there's a lot more to come. Alex says it's better than the original. I feel like...

KENNEY: Wow.

DAVIDSON: ...It's certainly really good. I don't know if it's better than the original, but it's really fun catching up with people.

KENNEY: Well, let's see what the PLANET MONEY audience thinks. You guys can send us your comments, questions, concerns and pictures - we love your pictures - planetmoney@npr.org. That's going to be it for us today. I'm Caitlin Kenney.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you for listening.

Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
Very excited to have a special guest co-host.
Hello. I'm Caitlin Kenney, Planet Money's producer.
In front of the mic today instead of behind.
Today is Friday, September 25th.
That was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, you heard at the top,
talking about the B20, I mean G20.
And anyway, that's the subject of today's podcast.
But first, the Planet Money indicator.

You can find a way for your cell phone to work.
Your cell phone's going to work. You're going to have an ATM card.
You know, we're talking about US, UK, Japan, rich, rich countries, Germany, China.
But the G20, you start bringing in countries that have rich parts
and really, really poor parts, Brazil, India, Turkey,
countries where you can have a real first world experience
or you can have a more developing world experience.
And you might be a little nervous about the, you know, hospital system,
that kind of thing.

the country is needed to build a stronger, more balanced global economy,
reform the financial system, and lift the lives of the poorest.
Sounds like a natural thing to do.
We checked in with our friends at Eurasia Group,
the political economy consulting group,
to see what they have to say about all this.
I talked to David Gordon, he's the head of research at Eurasia Group,
and asked him to remind us what the G7, G8 was to begin with.
The G7, G8, when it began, I think about 30 or 35 years ago,
it began as the G5, I believe,
and it was really the first effort to really do serious macroeconomic coordination,
policy coordination among the world's leading economies.
But it hasn't really had a major economic policy coordination role,
really for, I'd say, a good 20 years.
So I think this effort to basically displace the G7, G8 with the G20 is,
first of all, I think well-intentioned.
This is the right thing to do, that the G7, G8 construct
was too narrow a set of countries to have around the table,
and I think the danger here was that you were going to have
both of these things alive at the same time,
and I think the concern on the Obama administration was that
this would just take up literally too much high-level time and effort
and be redundant, so I give them credit,
and I give the G20 credit for really saying,
this is it, we're no longer going to do the G7, G8,
it's going to be the G20.
That said, how much actual real coordination
and collaboration you get out of it is an open question.
I think it's a useful instrument for having discussions,
for clarifying issues, for raising issues,
but this is a very disparate set of countries,
and I think if it was hard to get coordination among the G7,
it's going to be much harder to get it among the G20.
But it doesn't mean that it's not a useful thing to do once or twice a year
to have this particular set of leaders meet, interact,
talk about both big financial and economic issues
and larger issues that face the world at large.
So before, say, the mid-1970s,
we had the Bretton Woods system, we had a gold standard,
and that really was some firm rules that created...
those were some firm rules that defined global international economic cooperation activity.
And the U.S. was still by far the dominant actor on the scene.
So that combination of a structured system, firm rules, and a real...
G1.
G1. That was the world before the creation of the G5,
what became the G7.
Because we started having Europe post-Marshall Plan,
becoming obviously a power, Japan hurling on the stage.
Exactly.
Yeah. And then eventually, of course, Russia became capitalist,
and China, obviously, we're hearing about them, and India, and Brazil.
But what we have is a...
We have a lot more players.
We have a much more chaotic, less structured global economy.
Is that fair?
Much more chaotic and much less structured.
And I think in the aftermath of the financial crisis,
that becomes even more so.
Because what the financial crisis does is it really undermines the legitimacy
and the influence of the U.S. financial model
and of inherent U.S. leadership in this whole system.
And so I think we're heading into a world
that just has a lot more economic diversity in it.
And the high tide of free market reforms that we've seen
in the last 25 or 30 years is really now ebbing.
And we're going to have a more diverse world.
That's why I think this is a good thing,
even if it doesn't lead to a lot of coordination,
that getting these diverse voices engaging in a periodic way will be useful,
but expectations of actual concrete achievements, I think, have to be kept modest.
So there's never been more of a need for something like the G20
to coordinate the global economy,
and it's never been less likely that they could actually coordinate the global economy.
Yeah, I think that's right.
I think actual coordination of the global economy is an expectation too far.
So the need is that you have a forum in which the leaders can talk about issues,
can engage in debates, can begin to move towards consensus if possible,
can highlight areas of concern in which caution has to be taken.
And I think that's going to be really the role of the G20.
I think that the first two meetings,
the meeting at the end of last year that President Bush hosted,
and then the meeting in April that Prime Minister Gordon Brown hosted,
those were in some ways exceptions because those were really crisis-driven events.
Whereas what we're seeing now I think is likely to be the transition meeting
towards a more institutionalized, more normal set of meetings among the leaders.
All right, David, thank you so much.
And this will be something for us at Planet Money to pay a lot of attention to.
I know obviously Eurasia Group, this will be a major issue for you guys as well.
And we'll be talking about it throughout the coming years
because I think for me this is one of the most fascinating things about where we are.
I mean, if you look at modern financial history,
you have these periods of a firm gold standard.
You have sort of the defining Soviet, U.S. world.
Yes, that's right.
And now we have this...
We're in a very transitional world.
Yeah, there are no clear rules.
That's right.
No, it's a fascinating world,
and that lack of explicit structure happens at the national level,
but it also happens at the global level,
and that's what these leaders are trying to grapple with.
So, Caitlin, I have to say the G20 covering the G20 meeting,
this is an assignment.
I've been asked a few times like,
Adam, why don't you go cover the G20?
And I always try to avoid it because as a reporter,
yes, there's big important things happening in some room that you can't get to
even with your press pass.
It's all blocked off.
It's all blocked off, yeah.
You're just waiting for a press conference or a press release.
I mean, even when it was in Moscow or lots of cool countries,
I didn't want to go.
And now it's in Pittsburgh, which...
What do you have against Pittsburgh?
I mean, I've been there.
I like it.
It's a perfectly nice city,
but I'm not dying to get myself to Pittsburgh.
Clearly, you've never had a sandwich at Primanti Brothers.
No, I never.
No, I haven't.
Well, maybe if you'd had one, it would change your mind.
They're really good.
Yeah, amazing.
All right.
I'm convinced.
You know what?
I'm going to go to the airport right now.
I'm going to go to Pittsburgh.
I'm going to cover the G20.
Too late.
Too late.
And he already sent Scott Horsley.
And, of course, I knew that because you and I,
Caitlin, talked to Scott earlier this morning.
That's right.
Scott Horsley is, of course, NPR's White House correspondent.
We talked to him earlier today about what it's like to be there.
So, Scott, you are in Pittsburgh.
You are just one of the many important people who are in Pittsburgh right now.
Yes, far down on the pecking order, for sure.
So, who's there?
I mean, I think everyone knows what's going on, but just tell us what's going on.
Well, there are leaders of the G20 countries here.
That's the 20 biggest industrial and developing nations.
And they're here to talk about how to head off financial crises,
like the one that we're hopefully now coming out of,
and to put the world's economy on a more sustainable growth trajectory.
This is a very sophisticated gathering.
I can imagine, which leads me to believe that you got as far away from that gathering as possible.
I want to say, for years now, when I was an international economics correspondent,
every year when there was a G20 meeting, I would think, oh, I should go.
And then I would always find an excuse not to go,
because I just pictured myself sitting in some hotel conference room
with a hundred other reporters watching really boring speeches on TV, being nowhere near.
We don't actually watch the speeches.
You don't, okay.
But it is pretty hard.
It is pretty hard.
But otherwise, that's a pretty accurate description.
It's just you and a bunch of reporters sitting around.
That's right.
And somewhere nearby here, momentous economic decisions are being made.
So what do you do when you are a reporter in Pittsburgh,
there's the 20 most powerful people in the world sitting around talking,
and you have no access to them?
What I tried to do, Adam, was really go to somebody who had an overview of this G20 summit,
someone who could sort of give you the big picture, the whole international scope.
So I wound up at the Church Brew Works.
That's a historic church on Liberty Avenue here in Pittsburgh
that has been refashioned as a brew pub.
And that's where they cooked up something called the B20.
It's a beer made with ingredients from many, if not all, of the G20 nations.
Now, you can imagine this is an enormously complicated, in-depth task
that involves lots of frameworks and timetables to come up with something like that.
At least you'd think that would be the case,
but Master Brewer Brant Duvavik told me it really was not all that formal.
We sort of just winged it and got a list of spices
and chief exports of the countries of the G20.
We came up with 14 good ones that we could get commonly everywhere,
went down to Penzi Spices, got everything played around with it a little bit
to see what it would taste like,
and just went with it and brewed a seven-barrel batch.
By the way, that's 31 gallons to the barrel,
so they made about 256 gallons of this B20 brew,
and I got to taste some of it. It's not bad.
So what are some of the spices in there that he was talking about?
Well, some of them are hops and malt,
the kind of stuff you would expect to be in beer.
Hops and malt from Canada, Britain, or whatnot.
But there was also charnushka from India.
That's the black seeds that give garam masala its flavor.
There are also the black seeds on Jewish rye bread,
which is kind of an interesting note.
Turkey supplied something called mahalab,
which is made from the pits of sour cherries.
Have you ever had sour cherry pit beer before?
No.
I don't think so.
But brewmaster Dubovic, you know,
he mentioned that they tried to get the major exports
of these different countries represented,
and that's kind of essential
because exports and imports are a big part of what the G20 is all about.
Part of putting that economy on a more sustainable growth path
is to try to have a more balance
so you don't have some countries like the U.S.
saving too little and importing too much,
and other countries like China, for example,
exporting too much and saving too much.
They're trying to have a more balanced economy,
and balance turns out to be something
that brewmaster Dubovic knows a lot about.
Without balance, the beer could actually just go to one side.
If you're using too many hops,
all you're going to get is that hop bitterness.
If you're using too much malt,
you're just going to get too much of the malt,
so we definitely strive for balance in everything we brew here.
Now, Scott, I don't know if you know this,
but Planet Money's own Caitlin Kenny
is a newly christened brewmaster herself.
It's true. I've been home brewing.
And bringing it in, it's been delicious.
Thank you.
And it's very true what he says about the hops and the malt,
really, balance is the key.
You don't want too prominent of one flavor when you're brewing.
Have you tried brewing garam masala beer?
No, I haven't.
But as soon as you said that, I was like,
hmm, I have some of that home in my cupboard.
So tell me what it tasted like.
Did it taste in balance?
Did it taste like the ideal global economy
in which there's not huge trade gaps,
trade deficits, trade surpluses?
Well, it tasted good.
It's kind of heavy.
It's sort of a heavy English brown ale.
It was a lot of alcohol, about 7% alcohol.
But yeah, it wasn't too sweet, wasn't too hoppy.
They did not actually manage to get all 20 countries represented.
Apparently, some of the Islamic countries were not eager
to participate in this little brewing experiment.
Oh, that makes sense, yeah, yeah.
Although Indonesia, of course, the world's most populous
Islamic country apparently had no problem supplying jackfruit.
So it's got jackfruit in the B20 beer,
buckwheat from Russia,
pumpkin from right here in the U.S. of A.
Pumpkin was the U.S. thing?
Well, pumpkin and Chinook hops.
Really? And did it taste like beer?
Did it taste like some weird soup?
No, it absolutely tasted like beer.
Wow.
And I think there's a lesson for that.
We can all get along within the brewer's bat.
I will just think of the taste of the B20
whenever I think about global discord.
So Scott, I guess is the big news out of the G20
that now we're moving from a world where the G7 or the G8,
in other words the seven or eight richest countries in the world,
make the key decisions about the world economy.
Now we're adding 13 or 12 countries,
and the G20 is going to be the main body.
Can you explain what that difference is?
That's right.
We have now had an agreement by the members of the G20
that this going forward will be the go-to body
for international economic cooperation.
Now you could say, in some sense,
that's just a recognition of the world as it is today
because major fast-growing economies like China and India and Brazil
exist somewhere between eight and 20,
and they were not included when the G8 was meeting.
So to say that now the G20 will be the go-to body
is just really to say we're moving the economic cooperation
in the 21st century and recognizing,
hey, there's billions of people out there
that we need to take account of.
I remember after the G8 summit in L'Aquila, Italy earlier this year,
President Obama was asked about what's the right size international body
to have these kinds of meetings,
because obviously the more countries that are included,
it does get more unwieldy, it's a little bit more difficult,
but they want to have representation from a broad swath
of the economic might out there in the world.
The president said, you know, whatever place,
whatever rank your country is in,
that's what you think ought to be the size.
So if you're the 15th largest economy, you want to have the G15.
Right, if you're the 68th, you want the G68.
Why isn't it the G68? Absolutely, yeah.
It's kind of like what we used to call the big three automakers.
Right.
Now when I heard this announcement, the cynic in me said,
oh, so now when there's some meaningless,
vague statement of international cooperation
that doesn't actually change anything,
it's not going to be seven or eight guys in suits standing there making it.
It's going to be 20.
That's right, and it may be all the more vague and meaningless
in order to get consensus among the 20,
but to the extent that they are making meaningful moves,
obviously you want to have those major developing countries included.
Man, you guys are really cynical.
You have not covered enough bureaucratic government press conferences, I think.
That's true.
That does suck the soul out of you.
You know what, though?
All that talk about beer really made me thirsty.
I've got to say, I've been picturing all day in my taste memory
the really amazing beers you brought in.
I was under the impression that would be a regular thing,
maybe Friday afternoons.
I don't know if you noticed, I've been a little busy here.
On top of my regular job, you guys have me filling in,
hosting this podcast, and I haven't really had time.
Yeah, you love it.
Yeah, I know, it's fun.
But let's get out of here so I can go home and brew some more.
Okay, so that's going to be it for us today.
Please visit our blog, npr.org slash money.
We have this great essay there from Glenn Pizzola Russo,
fans of our story The Giant Pool of Money may remember him.
He was the guy who partied with the B-list celebrities.
Tara Reid, Cuba Gooding Jr.
The kid from Filthy Rich Cattle Drive,
and he talks about how losing millions of dollars
has actually changed his life dramatically.
And you can hear more from Glenn and a bunch of the other people
in that piece on This American Life this weekend, right, Adam?
You guys have a big show coming up.
Yeah, actually, Alex is at work right now finishing the touches.
I recorded the tracks yesterday.
It's basically half of the original Giant Pool of Money,
and then half of the hour will be us catching up with people.
You've heard some of that on the podcast,
but there's a lot more to come.
Alex says it's better than the original.
I feel like it's certainly really good.
I don't know if it's better than the original,
but it's really fun catching up with people.
Well, let's see what the Planet Money audience thinks.
You guys can send us your comments, questions, concerns, and pictures.
We love your pictures.
PlanetMoney at npr.org.
That's going to be it for us today.
I'm Caitlin Kenney.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
All we can do is touch.
So why don't we come together?
