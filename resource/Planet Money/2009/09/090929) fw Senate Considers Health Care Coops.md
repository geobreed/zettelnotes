Health care cooperatives are insurance companies owned by ordinary patients who buy in. The Senate Finance Committee is working on a $6 billion measure, pushed by Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), that would set up health care cooperatives across the nation. The idea is to have cooperatives take the place of the public option, in which the government would set up an insurance plan to compete with ones from private companies. A health coop that saves you money may be something of a unicorn, says reporter Keith Seinfeld of Seattle's KPLU. Seinfeld belongs to a health care cooperative already, one of only two in the country. He says he doesn't see his own Group Health Cooperative as being better than other providers at controlling costs. What's more, the input from its 600,000 members may not amount to much when only 3,000 of them choose to vote. With an expert opinion from Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee, who says health coops are expensive to start and run. Their main benefit: They make people happier.

A health co-op that saves you money may be something of a unicorn, says reporter Keith Seinfeld of Seattle's KPLU. Seinfeld belongs to a health care cooperative already, one of only two large co-ops in the country. He says he doesn't see his own Group Health Cooperative as being better than other providers at controlling costs. What's more, the input from its 600,000 members may not amount to much when only 3,000 of them choose to vote.

**faster whisper:**
There's no really example of either the regulation or how you'd establish them or where they'd
get enough people to have a purchasing base and so you might as well talk about unicorns.
I mean, you know, what's a medical unicorn?
My kids all know what a unicorn is, but you don't, you've never seen one.
So I think this co-op is just a way of ducking the issue of having a public plan.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money, I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt.
And I'm Caitlin Kenney.
Today is Monday, September 28th and you just heard Representative Pete Stark, Democrat from
California and Chair of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee during a conference
call with reporters.
Today we are talking about unicorns.
My kids all know what a unicorn is, but you don't, you've never seen one.
Unicorns and health insurance.
And star shine.
No, no, we're being very serious today, just health insurance and unicorns.
And also today we're going to take a hardened, cynical, seen-it-all health reporter and
we are going to surprise him.
But first, our Planet Money indicator, it's 3,000.
3,000 people, people who live in the great Pacific Northwest and who every year those
people cast a vote for who they would like to run their insurance company.
Yes, we're going to make sense of that number and that idea, voting for your insurance
company directors.
But first we need a little review.
Right, okay.
So last week we did this show about the idea of a public option.
So that's where the government sets up an insurance program to compete with private
insurers.
And right now there are basically two kinds of people.
There are people who love this idea.
They love the idea of a public option.
And people who hate it.
Right.
But there is, we are going to introduce today, there is another kind of person.
Yes, a strange, late to the party, unexpected guest who does not want to sit on the
public option couch or the private insurance couch.
They want to sit on the shag carpet next to the lava lamp in the middle of the
room.
No.
That shag carpet that you're talking about, that is healthcare cooperatives.
So healthcare cooperatives, they're kind of new to the whole scene.
They are not a public option.
They're not just leaving everything to private insurers.
Healthcare cooperatives are insurance companies that are owned by members, by patients,
but they're privately run.
And right now there's a bill in the Senate Finance Committee that would set up
these things in every state or every region.
And the bill is mostly referred to as Senator Max Baucus' bill.
But the co-ops part, the co-ops part is Senator Kent Conrad's baby.
Here's Conrad talking earlier this summer on CNN about the benefits of cooperatives.
The thing that co-ops address are really twofold.
One, providing additional competition.
Right.
And number two, being an entity that is not government run, government controlled,
but is a non-for-profit competitor.
So Caitlin, when Conrad started talking about cooperatives on national TV and specifically
talking about the idea that cooperatives were going to bring costs down, my buddy
Keith Seinfeld, he's a health reporter, generally very measured, very calm, soft-spoken
guy.
Well.
I was totally surprised.
I can't remember where I first heard it.
It was probably in, I probably saw it in an email, one of the emails I get some
list I subscribe to that talking about things that are being discussed in healthcare
reform.
And, you know, I probably didn't gasp, but I think I may have laughed out loud.
I may have choked on something if I was eating it.
So Keith works at KPLU in Seattle, my personal favorite NPR member station.
Gee, I wonder why.
Yes.
KPLU has been very good to me.
And Keith is one of those beat reporters.
He's been covering health forever.
He reported on the last time we tried to overhaul the system in the early 90s.
And to him, the whole conversation sounds familiar.
Should insurance be through your employer?
Why is it so expensive?
How do we cover the uninsured?
Blah, blah, blah.
But then all of a sudden, you know, here is Senator Conrad saying we need to create
health care cooperatives.
And to Keith, I mean, part of why that was so weird to Keith is because he knows
health care cooperatives.
There are only two existing in this country and one is in Seattle and it is his insurance
company Group Health Cooperative.
So much of the discussion has been around controlling costs and Group Health doesn't
seem to me as an organization that is controlling costs any more or less than anybody else.
And to hold that up as a model for all the benefits it may have, it just doesn't
seem like something you would set up statewide to answer all the problems that you're
trying to solve in the health care debate.
And to me, it's interesting because I still really am struggling to understand what they
mean.
I mean, I know what a co-op is.
And we had co-ops when I was in college.
There were little co-ops on campus.
You could live in a co-op and it meant you made your own meals and you cleaned
your own rooms and you all had, it was a commune is really what it was.
And I know what Group Health Cooperative is, but a statewide co-op that's chartered
by the federal government.
That just seems like using the word co-op to talk about something else.
And I don't know what that something else is.
Just so I'm understanding this, Hanna, a cooperative like the one in Seattle, it's
basically an insurance company that's owned by its members and it's being presented
at this new idea, but it's not really.
Yeah. I mean, that's what's weird about it.
Co-ops are not really new to the U.S.
So years and years back during World War II, the government set up health care
cooperatives. They were insurance companies that were cooperatives.
And and mostly they failed.
There are only two left.
There's the one in Seattle that Keith is a member of and there's one in
Minnesota. OK.
But what makes them different is that the patients get a say in how it's
run. Keith and all the other members get to vote for their board of
directors. In theory, I can vote.
So you know, not all.
Well, I have never attempted to.
I do remember getting the mailing sometime during the year that said that
these elections were happening and here are the people who are the
candidates. And but in order to vote, first you have to
say that you want to vote as I've never voted and I've never gotten a
ballot. You need to check a box at some point in time that says I want
to become a voting member and then you can go vote.
The number of people who vote is fewer than one percent of all the
members of group health. So really not a lot of involvement there.
So, Caitlin, that our indicator, the 3000 people who vote for who
they want to run their insurance company.
It is less than one percent of the total members of group health.
There are 600000 people who belong to this co-op and 3000 of them
actually vote. So Keith isn't alone there.
Right. But, Hannah, the thing I don't get is that we already have
nonprofit insurance companies.
And it sounds like the main difference is that with a cooperative you
get to vote for who runs it.
But if these people aren't voting, what's the real difference?
I mean, it sounds very similar.
And Keith actually says that the people who end up on the board of
group health, they're exactly the same people who would be on the board
of a nonprofit insurance company.
They're just community leaders, the movers and shakers, same people.
So there is this mystery and Keith has actually genuinely been
struggling to understand what does it mean that we may have these
cooperatives in every state?
How would that change anything?
So you asked your devoted hardworking producer, that would be me, to
track down someone who has studied co-ops.
Yeah. And what did you bring me, Caitlin Bupkis?
No, that's not true.
Usually I bring you lists and lists of names.
But this time I really tried, I really searched.
And despite this being a major part of a huge piece of legislation,
it's surprisingly hard to find someone who studied cooperatives.
But in the end, as usual, I came through for you.
Yes, you did. You could only find one guy, one man out there who
seems to have some expertise in cooperatives.
His name is Tim Jost.
He's a professor at Washington and Lee University.
So are you like the co-ops guy, you're the guy that everybody calls?
Yeah, I think so, which I think tells you something about how much
anybody knows about them.
I mean, there's not a literature out there on health care cooperatives.
They don't exist.
So Caitlin, Jost has basically spent the last few months trying to
figure out, OK, if we did do this cooperatives thing on a big
national scale, just how would it work?
The two co-ops that we have are so old.
So so what would it take to set up 50 or some new ones?
The first thing that you have to do if you want to establish a
new insurance company, health insurance company, is to put
together a provider network.
You have to have a network of providers of physicians,
hospitals, pharmacies, labs that agree to contract with you
and to provide you services at a discounted rate.
So that's the first hurdle.
And that's that's I think a big enough hurdle to pretty much
throw them out of competition.
The next thing they're going to have to do is to get all of the
things done, all of the resources, all of the
infrastructure together that you need to form a health
insurance company.
So they're going to have to do regulatory compliance.
They're going to have to.
Hanna, I'm just going to turn this down a little because he
went on for a really long time.
Apparently there are a lot of hurdles to setting up a brand
new insurance company.
You know, after you get your network set up, if you get your
network set up, then you have to deal with all the state
rules and regulations.
You have to figure out how to do claims processing and
underwriting.
OK, OK, OK, we get the point.
There are a billion boring things you have to do just to
get set up.
And it's expensive.
Right now, the Senate finance bill has six billion set
aside to start up these co-ops.
Not that six billion is nothing, but keep in mind that
Anthem bought Wellpoint for 16 billion.
That's just one insurance company buying another.
Yeah, so if you can get the money and all that other stuff
together, you still have one problem.
You have to get people to sign up for your plan.
And then they get to the third stage.
They're going to have to sign up members.
Now, there's a bit of a chicken and egg problem here
because they're owned by their members.
And so if you start out without any members, it's
unclear how you do that if you're owned by your
members.
But in any event...
So I'm thinking this is where we get to the unicorn.
Exactly.
Introducing co-ops into a marketplace and assuming
that they can compete with big, consolidated insurers
and bring costs down for all of us.
Great idea.
Maybe never happen.
Doesn't sound very likely.
Right.
Well, at least there is no evidence.
There's no research that it could happen.
And the co-ops that we do have, the two surviving
co-ops, they aren't really cheaper than the
alternatives.
Group Health Cooperative, Keith's insurance company,
their premiums went up 13 percent for a lot of
people last year.
The idea is that if you have a dominant insurer in
most markets, which seems to be the case, that
introducing some kind of competition from some
kind of other insurer will bring down costs.
And I think specifically the idea is that
administrative costs ought to be lower for
cooperatives.
They're nonprofit.
They don't have to make a profit.
They might be able to avoid some of the other
administrative costs of for-profit health plans.
And so they should, in theory, be able to offer
a better deal.
And that will create competition and would
force the other insurers to lower their premium
somewhat or lower the growth in their premium
somewhat.
I mean, the problem I have with that, though,
is that I think even though they don't have
to make a profit, I think in general, because
they're smaller and because they don't have
economies of scale, they're going to have higher
administrative costs in many areas.
And then most importantly, as I said earlier,
they're going to have to pay higher prices to
providers because they don't have the market
share.
Where I've seen cooperatives in operation,
they don't really compete on price.
They compete on quality.
They compete on customer satisfaction.
And that's good.
We need more quality.
We need insurance products that people are
really happy with.
But what we need most is cost control.
Jost is kind of dismissive of that last point,
but actually I feel like it's a good one and
a kind of a good spot to end.
So, yes, cooperatives may seem a little bit
like unicorns in their ability to keep costs
down, but they do actually exist in these
two places and people are part of them.
And those people tend to be happier than
people who are covered by other insurance
companies.
So they might not be cheaper, but they tend
to have fewer complaints.
So maybe there's something about that idea
that the members own it and that keeps them
happier.
Yeah, I guess so.
Even if none of them vote.
Right.
Yeah.
Keith, you should have voted.
Lazy.
OK, I think that's it for us today.
We'll be watching any and all unicorns in
health care, housing, finance,
development, and many more on our blog,

And if we missed any, you can send them to

We would love to hear from you.

Thanks for listening.
