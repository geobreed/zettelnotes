Since the start of the financial crisis, the U.S. government has put $50 billion into General Motors. After GM emerged from bankruptcy this year, the public owned 61 percent of the stock of the newly reconstituted company. How much of that $50 billion will the American taxpayer get back? CEO Fritz Henderson says business at GM is getting better, which is at least a hopeful sign for repayment. But the situation at GM is so complicated, Henderson says, that he can't say yet how much money GM will be able to return to the public coffers. Longtime auto analyst John Casesa has crunched the numbers we have. He says GM would have to do everything right, in a strong economy, to pay back what it owes. Meanwhile, a Congressional Oversight Panel report says the public will get back less than half the money it used to bail out GM and Chrysler.

Ali Leipsiger writes from the Brown School of Social Work:

    I really enjoyed the interview with Elinor Ostrom. I am no economist but I am a grad student at the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis and I am taking two classes this semester where the Tragedy of the Commons has been particularly relevant (Economics of Social Welfare and Social&Economic Development Policy) so I've enjoyed hearing her take on it — by the way, a lot of us in Social Work appreciate this sort of "community-based problem solving" stance.

    But what is more interesting is that last year we, in the Brown School of Social Work, had our own Tragedy of the Commons. We even called it that as a marketing scheme to change behavior. The school has two buildings and on the first floor of one is an area with a coffee shop, chairs and tables, a communal kitchen that we call the Commons. As last school year progressed, people were more inclined to leave their dirty dishes in the sink, leave their garbage on the tables and chairs, and even steal food from the communal fridge (which prompted some very nasty emails and posters about food insecurity/eating disorders). So a group of people got together and started talking about the "Tragedy of the Commons."

    To be honest, I don't think anything ever came of it — there certainly aren't different rules this year. But what was interesting was that last year things didn't get worse or even stay the same even though additional rules weren't enforced. The condition of the Commons improved simply because (I think) people were being called on their behavior. So... not so tragic, right? I'm very interested to see if the state of the Commons deteriorates as this year progresses and if it does if we'll have another "Tragedy of the Commons."

STEVE INSKEEP, host:

One year ago this week, the U.S. government bailed out some of the country's largest banks. The government has actually made some money off of that, about $10 billion so far. The situation is less clear, though, when you look at the auto bailout. Our Planet Money team has been checking in on our investment in General Motors.

David Kestenbaum has the story.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: In case you've lost track, U.S. taxpayers have put a total of $50 billion into General Motors. Initially, the aid was supposed to just help GM weather the storm, but, as we all know, the storm won, and General Motors went through bankruptcy. The new GM CEO Fritz Henderson recently sat down with my colleague Adam Davidson and ran through the company's financials.

Mr. FRITZ HENDERSON (CEO, General Motors): We talked about debt preferred in common. Okay?

ADAM DAVIDSON: You're writing that down for radio listeners.

Mr. HENDERSON: Sorry, this helps me think about it. So, the debt to the U.S. and the Canadian government is about $8 billion. And it's six-seven and one-three.

KESTENBAUM: What Henderson is saying there is that as a result of the bankruptcy restructuring, General Motors only owes the U.S. government $6.7 billion. Now, that does mean that the rest of the $50 billion the U.S. invested is gone, because guess who owns 61 percent of this brand new General Motors company? We do, the taxpayers. That's what we got out of the bankruptcy.

So, the question is: What is that stock worth? Or, more importantly, what will it be worth? The stock isn't traded publicly yet, so there's no easy way to put a price on it.

Henderson says business is looking okay. September sales were abysmal compared a year ago, he says, but people still bought GM vehicles. The company captured one-fifth of the U.S. market.

Mr. HENDERSON: In an absolute sense, we weren't particularly happy given how weak the industry was, but our share performance was actually the best we had this year. And, you know, and I'd say so far October has shaped up okay, too. So, you know, good initial encouraging signs.

KESTENBAUM: By all accounts, General Motors was a mess before the bankruptcy. Steven Rattner, who led the U.S. auto taskforce, describes his experience in the current issue of Fortune magazine.

Rattner writes, quote, "Everyone knew Detroit's reputation for insular, slow-moving cultures. Even by that low standard, I was shocked by the stunningly poor management that we found. The top brass," he wrote, "were sequestered on the uppermost floor behind locked and guarded doors with elevator cars that would take them directly to their private garage."

So, will the taxpayers get their money back? John Casesa with the Casesa Shapiro Group says maybe. Casesa is a long-time auto analyst.

Mr. JOHN CASESA (Auto Analyst, Casesa Shapiro Group): GM would have to have a very impressive turnaround, and, you know, start to earn a lot of money -seven, eight, $10 billion a year.

KESTENBAUM: Recently, General Motors has been losing billions. Still, Casesa says, the company is in a much better financial situation now after bankruptcy, and he expects the car market will come back.

Mr. CASESA: Sales are running at an extremely, extremely low rate, and I am well aware of all the reasons why the economy may be weak for some period of time. But if sales were to bounce just to 13 or 14 million, which is still well below the historical sales level, they could start to make a lot of money.

KESTENBAUM: Here are some sobering numbers, though: At its peak, if you took all of General Motor's stock and added it up, the company was worth $57 billion. Remember, taxpayers now own a little over half the company, so if we want all our money back, General Motors will have to be worth even more than it was in those happier days.

Jeremy Anwyl is CEO of Edmunds.com, which analyzes the auto industry, and he basically agrees with Casesa's analysis: it'll be hard for taxpayers to be made whole. But if you ask him was the bailout a bad idea, he says it's hard to know.

Mr. JEREMY ANWYL (CEO, Edmunds.com): I mean, I'm of two minds, 'cause on the one hand, you know, I'm kind of old school. I'm not sure if government should be investing in business like this. On the other hand, I think the consequences here would've been pretty dire, so sometimes you just kind of hold your nose and do the right thing, even though, you know, in principle, it's probably something we shouldn't have done.

KESTENBAUM: It's possible, he says, doing nothing might have been worse.
