The special investigator general for the TARP bailout told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform today that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner should have thwarted plans by foundering AIG to pay out $168 million in bonuses. SIG-TARP Neil Barosky reports that Geithner's former staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York knew about the bonuses when they were arranging the bailout of AIG — even if their boss didn't.

**faster whisper:**
Humans have great capabilities and somehow we've had some sense that the officials had
genetic capabilities that the rest of us didn't have.
I hope we can change that.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg.
Today is Wednesday, October 14th.
That was Eleanor Ostrom, one of the winners of this year's Nobel Prize in Economics you
heard at the top.
On the podcast today, we're going to tackle some economic riddles, but first, the Planet
Money indicator.
The indicator is $3.6 billion.
That was very dramatic.
That was a dramatic read of the indicator, Adam.
Thank you.
It was a very dramatic indicator.
That is how much profit JPMorgan Chase reported earning in the third quarter of this year.
Now, JPMorgan Chase's profits were led by their investment banking division.
They doubled their profits, more than doubled their profits over last year.
Turns out that getting rid of many of your key competitors, having them go out of business,
is very good for business.
But the other interesting thing is it's not that they're yet making money off of
consumer loans.
They're still losing money, but they're losing less money, and the pace of change
suggests that soon it will be profitable again to lend money to consumers, which
implies that we'll be getting more higher credit card limits and more mortgages and the
like.
Some people are saying that JPMorgan Chase may be a harbinger of good things to come
in our economy.
Now, one thing, Adam, though, is that it's hard to figure out how to think about this.
Here we have a banking industry that a year ago was on death store, if not for
massive government infusions of capital.
I would say a year ago was dead, right, if not for government.
JPMorgan Chase and every other major bank in America would have gone out of business.
I think that's almost a clearly safe thing to say.
It's a safe thing to say, right.
And JPMorgan Chase, by all accounts, was one of the healthiest and safest of those big
banks.
Most prudent, but even they were in a lot of trouble.
They were in a lot of trouble.
And today they're making record profits.
And it's hard to know, like, is that, on the one hand, maybe that's a sign that
the economy is getting better.
On the other hand, it seems like it seems hard to imagine that they're not benefiting
in some way from the taxpayer-funded bailout.
And I just don't know how to feel about that.
Yeah, I know.
It's there's no question this is not fair in any sense of the word fair, I would
say.
The way one person I saw describe it is in war, we have collateral damage, that
horrible euphemism for civilians who die as a result of errant bombs or even accurately
positioned bombs.
Here we have collateral winners that we had this economic catastrophe a year ago
and the way it was solved meant that a whole bunch of really, really rich people, for
no reason, nothing they did, they got to be even richer and make more benefit.
And yeah, I mean, I feel like it's going to take years to sort of sort that out.
And it's hard not to feel sick in your stomach about it.
Right.
So on today's podcast, though, we're going to go from the macro to the micro
and answer some of your economic riddles, although I suppose this could be sort of
considered an economic riddle.
How does a bank that's almost failing a year ago make record profits in one year?
But we're going to go down to down a level to something that our listeners, you
out there have been wondering about.
And first up, we have a question from listener Mike Acoustic for economist
Emily Oster.
Emily is one of our favorite economists.
She's at the Chicago Booth School of Business.
We've had her on the podcast before to tackle questions about Ticketmaster and
food portions.
This time, we asked her Mike's question about minimum wage.
Why is it that those U.S.
cities that have raised minimum wage above the federal level have more
employment and a healthier economy?
Is there a point where minimum wage is so low as to discourage job seekers
from getting jobs?
So why is it that places that are doing better have have a higher minimum
wage? Right. That's what you say.
That was basically the question, right?
Well, I mean, it's or he's asking why is it that places with a higher minimum
wage are doing better?
So I guess he's implying a cost relationship.
He wants to ask in that direction.
So I would actually push back the other way and say one of the issues we
face very frequently in trying to evaluate the impact of policies like
something like the minimum wage is that you have to think about the
reason why the minimum wage was changed.
Right.
So say your city is doing really well.
Everything's going great.
There's a lot of growth.
Everybody's getting richer.
That's a situation in which you might want to think about raising the
minimum wage in which that's going to be more attractive, partially because
things are going well and people have more money to pay their workers.
But also to the extent that things are already going well and wages are
already going up, moving the minimum wage up doesn't affect that many
people.
So if you think that that the main people who are opponents of
increases in the minimum wage are people who are hiring people at the
minimum wage, if you take a place where everybody's already getting paid well
above the minimum wage, no one will object to raising it or very few
people are likely to object to raising it.
So politically, it's going to be easier to pass those kind of laws in
places where wages are already higher, places that are already doing better.
And if I can just jump in here, it sounds like you're taking issue
with the implicit...
The causation.
Causation.
He seems to be saying that when you raise the minimum wage, it helps your
economy, and you're saying, no, no, no.
Generally what happens is the economy is doing well and then people raise
the minimum wage, but there's not actually a causal link between the
higher minimum wage and a good economy.
Yeah, I guess I would say that I think there could be a causal link
between higher minimum wage and better economy in that direction, but
I think it's equally likely or I would say more likely that the causal
link goes in the other direction, that things are going well and you
raise the minimum wage.
I will say this is actually the canonical example in economics that
you're taught in a class about labor economics on why you have to be
concerned about reverse causality.
So there's a paper from the early 90s which tries to evaluate by
David Card and Alan Krueger, which tries to evaluate this by looking at
a period where New Jersey changed its minimum wage and Pennsylvania didn't
and looking at how employment changed before and after in these two places,
arguing that these are comparable for other reasons and looking at one
of them changes the minimum wage, one doesn't.
What happens to employment in the one that changed the minimum wage
relative to the one that didn't?
And they find basically very little or no effect on employment.
So that's, but anyway, this is a good example of a place where it's
very, very difficult to figure out which direction, which is what's
causing what, which is something economists, especially in these
applied fields, think a lot about.
Because to me when I first started studying economics, I thought this
was the absolute no-brainer of all no-brainers, which is if you
make something more expensive, meaning hiring the lowest paid people,
then people will do less of it.
And so minimum wage, it seemed to me, no question, there are people
unemployed because of the minimum wage.
There are fewer people employed because of the minimum wage.
But then David Card in that famous paper, he's an economics
professor at Berkeley who's most known for this work, although there's
been counter work that argues the exact opposite that's also well
respected, says, no, no, no, that's not right.
And but isn't this as simple as the demand curve slopes downward?
It's like the most basic thing.
It's like if there was a minimum thing that apples all have to
cost $3, people would buy fewer apples.
It's just we know that that's how economics works.
Yeah, I mean, I think you have to wonder, it depends on the
demand curve does slope down, but it depends on where it is also.
So if nobody in equilibrium, imagine if in equilibrium, nobody is
paying anybody less than minimum wage.
So everybody's marginal product, the thing that they're able to
produce in their job is $7.
And so everybody's getting paid $7 because we think people get
paid their marginal product, the amount that they're able to
produce, then it doesn't matter if your minimum wage is $5, $6,
whatever, there's nobody who you would be interested in paying
less than that.
So I think that's the argument under which it wouldn't matter that
the demand curve slopes down.
It does slope down over some range.
It doesn't really, there's nobody in that area.
So I just want to quickly, Alex, explain this.
The demand curve slopes downward, you just, you know,
that simple graph from your Econ 101 course where supply meets
demand, the demand curve goes downward, meaning the higher
prices go, that's the bottom access, the x-axis, the higher
prices go, the less the demand is, that's the y-axis on the
left side.
Demand slope curves downward as economics speak for when
things cost more, fewer people buy them.
So what she's saying is, yes, on most goods,
if the government steps in and says, OK,
no one can charge less than this, you know,
apples cost $3 per apple no matter what,
then fewer people are going to buy them.
But what if they didn't say apples are going to cost $3?
They said apples, you have to set a minimum price of apples
will only cost $0.02.
Right, and apples cost more than $0.02.
You can't find an apple right now for $0.02.
So that would have, that ruling would have no effect
basically on the price of apples because apples already
cost more than what the government is saying they
should cost.
Right, so if minimum wage was $50 an hour,
that would have a huge impact.
There'd be massive turmoil in America.
But because minimum wage is so much lower
than the vast majority of people make,
it has a minimal impact.
Now, the other argument is that people
are different from apples.
And when you pay people more,
they then go on to demand more goods.
They buy more cell phones and haircuts
and pay rent and all the other things they do.
And that money is recycled through the economy.
So that is part of the argument
from other people saying, oh no, minimum wage is different.
It doesn't overall suppress wages.
But we will leave that to the experts to argue over.
Yes, exactly.
All right, our next question comes from you, Adam.
You had a riddle.
And this is a question that you put to Robert Frank.
Robert Frank is a professor of economics
at Cornell University, author of the fantastic Economic
Naturalist's Field Guide.
I'd say Emily Oster, Robert Frank,
two of our very favorite economists,
very different perspectives, very cool people.
Frank goes out looking for these types of riddles.
He's constantly trying to figure out
little weird mysteries, as we've had him on talking about.
So I wanted to ask him one I've been wondering about lately.
I'm a bit of a computer geek on the weekends.
I like to mess around with my computer.
And I've been noticing how crazy software is priced.
I'm looking at one product called BB Edit, which
is a well-known text editor that costs, I think, $125.
And there's several products that some people say are better,
some people say are worse, but don't seem radically different,
that are either free or $8.
In fact, BB Edit itself has a free product
that it effectively competes with, obviously
a product with fewer features.
Have you taken a look at or do you have thoughts about why
software is so non-standardized
in the pricing?
You can spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars
for Microsoft Office, but you can get open office for free.
You can spend hundreds of dollars for some video games,
but there's tons of games for free on the internet.
I get really confused about the economics.
Yeah, this is a prime example of a product category
where all the costs of getting the product produced
are essentially fixed costs.
Once you've got the software code written
for the deluxe version of it, then the marginal cost
of giving somebody a copy of it is essentially zero.
That means if there were pure competition
and price got driven down to marginal cost,
as in the traditional models, then the companies
could never recover their cost of developing the program.
They wouldn't make any money, they'd lose money.
So they've got to charge some people a price
well above marginal cost of zero.
And who is that?
Well, again, they always look for a way to segment the market.
They can't ask you when you walk in the store
how much are you willing to pay, but they can do this.
They can say, here's the deluxe version,
and then they can take a few lines of code out.
Here's an editing program that doesn't do quite as much
as the deluxe version, and say the price of this one
is high, the price of this one is low,
maybe even free, and you take your pick.
And the people who really care the most
about the features are the ones who are willing
to jump over that hurdle and pay the high price.
So the price is almost like market research
or price discrimination.
We're essentially relying on the buyer
to identify himself, how much he cares about price,
by deciding whether or not to make
do with a lower quality model or pay the higher price
and get the higher quality model.
Right.
I've heard the same thing said about Starbucks
that if you look at the actual cost of producing
a iced double latte, mocha, whatever,
it's only a few pennies more cost
than just a regular cup of coffee,
but it costs $5 instead of $1.50 or whatever.
I don't know what the price is.
Yeah, it's the exact same phenomenon.
They've got a lot of costs in getting the franchise up
and running and delivering all those things that they do.
The marginal cost of making the drinks,
that's not so different, one drink versus another.
So they try to figure out which of the drinks people
care most about, put high prices on those
and lower prices on the others.
I see.
So if you run Starbucks or you run a software company,
you're basically saying, all right, I've
got millions of people out there.
I know some of them are just penny pinchers
and will only pay the minimum, and some of them
are willing to pay $4 or $5 above my cost.
I could make 800% profit or more.
And so you discover that by creating
slightly different products with different prices.
And there's an incredible variety of ways they do that.
I mean, the Apple laptop came out a couple of years
ago in a black version and a white version.
Previously, it had been only a white version.
And they charged about $150 extra
for the equivalent black version.
And people were, many of them, glad to pay it,
others who didn't care that much about color and price
was more important for them.
They said, well, I'm going to get the white one.
I'll get the cheap one.
Yeah.
I just want to explain marginal price, OK?
There's this idea of margin, on the margin,
the marginal price, the marginal consumer.
My understanding is beforehand,
the way people would think is, I make shirts, say.
And I just made 10 shirts.
It cost me $100.
So I'm going to charge at least $10 per shirt
and maybe a little extra so I can make a profit.
And then economists came along and said, uh-uh.
Charge $3 per shirt, because we figured out
that's the marginal cost.
And I think intuitively, that doesn't make any sense at all.
You should pay the average cost for all of them,
not the marginal cost.
So can you help me define what the marginal cost is,
and is that right, and why does it make sense?
Yeah, the average cost is a pretty simple concept.
You just take all the costs you've incurred
and divide that number by the number of units
you've produced.
So in your example, $100 total cost, 10 shirts,
that's $10 average cost per shirt.
If you're not going to charge people an average of $10
for the shirts, those 10 shirts you sell them,
you're going to lose money.
So that's a constraint right out of the box.
You've got to expect that you're
going to be able to cover your average costs,
or else you won't enter that business in the first place.
Then the question is, can you
come up with a pricing scheme that
will make you do better than if you charge the same price
to everyone for shirts?
So suppose you could sell your shirts for $11 each.
And suppose the marginal cost of making now
that you've got your factory set up is only $3 per shirt.
Well, you could make money if you charged $11.
That's true.
But what if you charged $12 or $15
for some of the shirts you sold,
and you put a special emblem on those,
and people who wanted that badge of distinction
for whatever reason were willing to pay the extra,
and then put the plain ones on sale for $4?
You might be able to expand your sales way beyond 10
shirts to 100 shirts.
And if you're selling just the same limited number
at $15, that didn't cost you much more
to produce with the emblem on it.
And then you've way expanded production
of the cheaper ones at $4, you're
going to make a lot more total earnings
than if you'd sold just 10 shirts for $11.
You don't need to sell the $15 shirt.
In most production, your cost per unit, each new one you
make, is typically a little less,
because you're getting better at it, you're more efficient.
Often there's fixed costs.
You have to buy the factory, you have to whatever.
And so each additional one is cheaper.
If you stick to the average cost of $10,
then your market reaches only so much.
So if you sold all of them for, say, $3.50,
and your marginal cost is $3, then you can,
then you sell 1,000 of them, and now you've made $3,500,
and you've more than covered your fixed costs,
and you're making a profit, right?
Yeah.
So as long as you're selling shirts, some of your shirts
for more than the marginal cost,
if you're selling enough of them for enough more
than the marginal cost, you will cover your fixed costs,
and you'll make a profit.
That's what you need to do.
It's very counterintuitive, though.
I mean, like many economic ideas,
it's just because it's a leap of faith
if that's how you're going to do it, right?
If you're like, wait, that one cost me,
the first one cost me $20, and the second one
cost me $18.
How am I going to sell it for $3?
These kinds of processes you're talking about
are ones that we say exhibit economies of scale.
The more you produce, the cheaper
it is to produce things on the average.
And it's true that when you have really
substantial economies of scale, then by pricing the product
low, you can so expand your market
that you can make money even at a very low price.
Not all things have that, because sometimes there's
jump conditions where you then
have to build a second factory.
Exactly.
Not every good is produced under economies of scale.
But surprisingly, many are.
I think it's more often the case than not, in fact.
It just seems natural that anything you do
you'll get better at.
There's always some fixed cost in your system.
And making more units lets you spread that out
over more units and drives down the average cost.
OK, well, I think that is going to do it for us here
today.
