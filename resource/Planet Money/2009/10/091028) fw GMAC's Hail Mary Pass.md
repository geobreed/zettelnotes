GMAC is on the way to achieving the special distinction of three federal bailouts. The financial institution (and parent company of Planet Money sponsor Ally Bank) has already received $12.5 billion in assistance, for which the government has taken a stake of nearly 35 percent in the company.

Columbia economist Charles Calomiris says the GMAC case is textbook example of the dangers that come with taxpayer bailouts.

Calomiris says the government ends up giving money to keep a foundering bank afloat. The bank takes what's known as "resurrection risk," the economic equivalent of football's Hail Mary pass.

There's more. Paul Merski, senior vice president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, says that with government backing in place, GMAC is getting an unfair competitive advantage.

Ally Bank spokesperson Gina Proia says depositors get higher rates there because of its online model. Ally carries less overhead than a traditional brick-and-mortar bank, she says.

In its recent ad campaign, the GMAC subsidiary has poked fun at traditional banks, which has not made the traditional banks any too happy. A couple of samples:

**faster whisper:**
No more private jets, no more golf club dues, no more country club dues.
Perks, under the report, are limited to $25,000 per individual.
Hello and welcome to Envira's Planet Money. I'm Alex Resurrection Risk Bloomberg.
And I am Khanna Hot Money Jaffee Walt. Today is Wednesday, October 28th. And that was Kenneth
Feinberg, White House Paysar, testifying before Congress that you just heard at the top of the
podcast. He was talking about perks he has taken away from the finance and auto companies
that are under his control. And on the podcast today, we are talking about resurrection risk
and hot money. Right, which sadly is not as exciting as it sounds, but we will tell you
all about it. But first, our planet money indicator, it is $31,000. That is the number
of new homes that were sold in September 2009. And that number, Alex, is very low. Right,
it is the third lowest number for September on record since we started keeping track of these
numbers in 1963. And the number is also a third of what the number was in 2005 at the height of
the bubble. This is a bummer of a number because it seems like we're returning to a path that we
thought we might be coming out of. So last month in August 2009, new home sale numbers
were almost the same as August 2008 numbers, meaning that for the first time since this crisis
began, 2009 monthly numbers weren't dramatically lower than the 2008 numbers, which was great.
Up until August, that hadn't been the case. 2009 was worse than 2008, which was dramatically worse
than 2007, dramatically worse than 2006. Right, you get the idea. And we thought we were finally
reversing that trend, but September shows we're back on the down elevator. And speaking of
more of the same, let's get on to our main story today. The Wall Street Journal reported
this morning that GMAC, finance company, is going back to the treasury for yet more money.
And we've seen companies get bailouts before. Then we saw a bunch of companies get second
bailouts. But GMAC, GMAC is on its way to achieving a special distinction of three bailouts,
the third being on top of 12.5 billion that GMAC already received since December 2008.
Now we should say here Ally Bank, a subsidiary of GMAC, is a major funder for
planet money. So GMAC, a little history, it was primarily a financing arm of GM, meaning
they made loans to people who wanted to buy GM cars. But they were also lending money to people
who wanted to buy other things, namely houses. They did a lot of lending in the subprime mortgage
sector. Enough said about that. They got into trouble like pretty much the entire banking
system. And at the end of 2008, they got rescued by the U.S. government. But unlike the
other banks that were rescued, GMAC keeps coming back for more. They're reported to be
negotiating for anywhere from two and a half to five and a half billion more dollars.
And our colleague Adam Davidson and I called up Columbia economist Charles Kalamiris this morning.
We wanted to ask him what he thought about bailout number three. And Charles said he was
actually up until four in the morning last night writing a paper, and he hadn't heard the news
until we told him. And so we want to talk about overall. Wait, is that what you're laughing?
When you say they're going back for a third bailout, it's sort of like it's just a funny
thing. I have to laugh. Charles Kalamiris is, by the way, an expert on banks and banking
regulation. And he said, once he finished laughing, that what's happening with the
GMAC is a textbook example of the dangers you get into with government bailouts. GMAC
owes a lot of money, too much for it to pay back. Without help, the government steps in,
gives it that help, keeps it alive. But in doing so, it's handing over money to a bank
that's in a lot of trouble. Suppose that I'm in a situation where I know I'm already underwater,
by which I mean that I know that if I do nothing, my bank is dead. That is, I have
negative net worth. There's no value to this owning stock in this bank. If I don't do
anything, this bank is going to be shut down. So I say, well, you know, I'm not shut down
yet. So how about if I do some resurrection risk taking, I take a big risk. Maybe I expand
my bank substantially by borrowing a lot in the wholesale market. Then I go out and
lend it, do very risky things with it. Let's say there's only a five or 10 percent chance
I'm going to make a huge amount of profit from that risky bet. But if I do make that
huge amount of profit, I'm back in the game. I now have valuable stock. And so
what have I got to lose? I'm playing with someone else's money, namely the U.S. taxpayers.
So Charles Kalamir says this is such a common phenomenon that people who study this stuff have
given it a name. Do you want to say it, Alex? Resurrection risk. Resurrection risk. Alex
resurrection risk Bloomberg. And he says the tendency of banks to take bigger risks
to make more money. He calls that a Hail Mary pass, which Alex, I have to admit,
I did not know what that meant. Well, it's a football term. When a team is losing,
they have a couple of seconds left. They throw a huge long pass, which typically has a low chance
of success. And so they say it's basically a prayer. I know. I'm looking it up on Wikipedia
right now. It says a common term used to refer to any forward pass made in desperation with
only a small chance of success. Right. Exactly. So Kalamir is saying that that's what banks who
get into trouble are tempted to do. Basically make a desperate move with a small chance of
success. But what does a Hail Mary pass look like in banking terms? Well, it might look like
some of these new Ally Bank commercials that you've seen. Ally, remember, is the renamed
consumer banking division of GMAC. It used to be called GMAC Bank up until May of 2009.
And then they changed their name to Ally. So picture a floor with a rectangle drawn in the
middle of it and a child's bike is sitting right in the middle of that rectangle. And then
you've got a schmoozy banker type and an adorable redheaded girl.
Whoa, yeah. See, the terms require you to keep the bike in this predetermined space.
If you want to take the bike out, I'm going to have to charge you a penalty.
I can't really ride in this little space. Well, you can't ride very far.
Even kids know an offer shouldn't come with ridiculous conditions. Why don't banks?
We're Ally, a new bank whose no penalty CD lets you withdraw all your money and bring
it anywhere without a fee. It's just the right thing to do.
So Alex, what's crazy to me about this is this is a bank
making fun of stodgy bankers and all their rules.
Right. I know. Actually, they're actually really good. I like the ads. I think
they're funny. But the Hail Mary part of that ad, it's right there at the end.
And let's just listen again. We're Ally, a new bank whose no penalty
CD lets you withdraw all your money and bring it anywhere without a fee.
It's just the right thing to do. So a no penalty CD, that might
sound like a good thing. You don't have to lock your money up for six months or
a year. Like with most CDs, you can get the same good rate and withdraw your
money at any time. And Ally Bank has a lot of things like this that seem
like a great deal to you or me or the consumer.
The rates of their CDs, they are among the highest rates you can find
anywhere. For example, if you go to bankrate.com, it says Ally will give
you 2% a year. But big national banks like Wells Fargo right here,
which people consider to be one of the healthier banks out there, they
only give you 0.5%. So why exactly is this a Hail Mary
pass? Why is Ally giving you 2%? Well, Wells Fargo only gives you 0.5%.
Why is this a Hail Mary pass? Well, it's essentially Ally Bank saying,
hey, lend us your money. We really need it. We need it so bad.
We'll give you a much higher interest rate than the rest of the
banking industry is willing to give you. And that rest of the banking
industry, as you might imagine, those guys that Ally Bank is making fun
of in its ads, they're not so happy about this. So here is Paul
Merske. He's the senior vice president and chief economist of
Independent Community Bankers of America. They are offering those
rates because they receive exceptional assistance from the government
and taxpayers over $13.5 billion so far. And now they are going
to ask for a third round of assistance. So if you think
you're getting a better deal on a CD, it's already cost you
$13.5 billion and then some to get that higher price CD.
So people started the banking industry said that high interest
rates are just one of the risky practices that banks that get into
trouble will engage in. There's another one. This one is actually
my favorite. It's called Hot Money. Hot Money 99.9 FM. So Hot
Money is an industry term for so-called brokered deposits. And
these aren't deposits that are made by individuals like you and
me, Alex, but money raised by brokers to deposit into banks like
Ally. And they're considered riskier because brokers are only
interested in the interest rate. If the interest rate is high,
like at Ally right now, that's great for them. But all that
money, it could just flow out in the blink of an eye the
minute you lower that interest rate that you're paying.
And Paul Merske says it's one thing if a bank wants to
engage in these kinds of risky behaviors on their own,
pay much higher interest rates and raise a lot of money
through brokered deposits. But it's quite another thing when
that bank is doing that after getting a government bailout.
Everyone's trying to make the best of a very bad economic
situation and bad credit markets. And when you have
competition where the government is picking winners
and losers and giving three rounds of bailout money to one
bank that is then competing with you basically unfairly and
well beyond market prices, it's making the go even more
tough for those 8,000 banks out there.
So we talked to an Ally Bank representative, Gina Proia.
She didn't want to go on tape with us, but she did say
that the fact that Ally Bank is offering these high rates,
it has nothing to do with getting propped up by the
government. She says the reason they can offer these
rates is because it's an internet only bank. So they
have less overhead than brick and mortar competitors,
and they can pass on those cost savings to us, the
consumer, in the form of higher interest rates.
She also made the point that Ally Bank is a regulated bank.
It has lots of government regulators looking at it,
examining it, and it's meeting all its regulators
requirements. And so there are people watching it to
make sure that it's not behaving too riskily.
Alex, though, this does bring up a question which we
keep thinking about here.
Why?
Right. Exactly. Why? Why is the government doing
this? Why is the government propping up an institution
like GMAC? You know, it's one thing to rescue a
huge, systemically important firm like Citigroup or AIG,
where the argument was made that if they go under,
then the rest of us are in the soup lines.
We're screwed, too. But GMAC is small compared to
these big guys. It's smaller than Washington Mutual,
for example, which was allowed to fail. It was
seized by the FDIC and sold to JPMorgan Chase.
So we asked Charles Kalamiris at Columbia why.
Why GMAC?
I don't think you could argue that GMAC is a
systemically important institution.
I wasn't in favor of the bailout of General Motors
for exactly the same reason.
And so looking at GMAC and trying to understand
why are they having so much trouble?
You have to start, I think, with the politics
of the automobile bailout. But in fairness to them,
they are in a pretty tough niche right now,
trying to finance consumer credits at a time
when consumer credits are not looking very good.
I just wanted to touch on what Charles Kalamiris
just said there. He said that basically they're
in a pretty tough niche right now looking to
finance consumer credit at a time when consumer
credits are not looking very good.
If we can translate that out of economics,
he's basically saying that you don't want to
be a bank trying to make your money by lending
to people so that they can buy houses and cars,
because people aren't buying a lot of houses
and cars right now. So you can sort of think
of a bank as their primary job is to provide
a service that service is credit.
Right. That serves a need, an existing need.
Right.
You don't want to be in the business of serving
something that people don't actually want.
Right. And right now it seems like there's
not that many people who want to buy houses
and cars. And if your business is lending
to those people and trying to find people
like that to lend to, it seems like you're
in a shrinking business a little bit, you know,
at least for the time being.
Right. It's a rough spot to be in.
So we are going to watch what happens with GMAC
and with any other new bailouts that come up.
I think that's it for us for today.
