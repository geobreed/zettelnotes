Ali Leipsiger writes from the Brown School of Social Work:

    I really enjoyed the interview with Elinor Ostrom. I am no economist but I am a grad student at the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis and I am taking two classes this semester where the Tragedy of the Commons has been particularly relevant (Economics of Social Welfare and Social&Economic Development Policy) so I've enjoyed hearing her take on it — by the way, a lot of us in Social Work appreciate this sort of "community-based problem solving" stance.

    But what is more interesting is that last year we, in the Brown School of Social Work, had our own Tragedy of the Commons. We even called it that as a marketing scheme to change behavior. The school has two buildings and on the first floor of one is an area with a coffee shop, chairs and tables, a communal kitchen that we call the Commons. As last school year progressed, people were more inclined to leave their dirty dishes in the sink, leave their garbage on the tables and chairs, and even steal food from the communal fridge (which prompted some very nasty emails and posters about food insecurity/eating disorders). So a group of people got together and started talking about the "Tragedy of the Commons."

    To be honest, I don't think anything ever came of it — there certainly aren't different rules this year. But what was interesting was that last year things didn't get worse or even stay the same even though additional rules weren't enforced. The condition of the Commons improved simply because (I think) people were being called on their behavior. So... not so tragic, right? I'm very interested to see if the state of the Commons deteriorates as this year progresses and if it does if we'll have another "Tragedy of the Commons."

STEVE INSKEEP, host:

One year ago this week, the U.S. government bailed out some of the country's largest banks. The government has actually made some money off of that, about $10 billion so far. The situation is less clear, though, when you look at the auto bailout. Our Planet Money team has been checking in on our investment in General Motors.

David Kestenbaum has the story.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: In case you've lost track, U.S. taxpayers have put a total of $50 billion into General Motors. Initially, the aid was supposed to just help GM weather the storm, but, as we all know, the storm won, and General Motors went through bankruptcy. The new GM CEO Fritz Henderson recently sat down with my colleague Adam Davidson and ran through the company's financials.

Mr. FRITZ HENDERSON (CEO, General Motors): We talked about debt preferred in common. Okay?

ADAM DAVIDSON: You're writing that down for radio listeners.

Mr. HENDERSON: Sorry, this helps me think about it. So, the debt to the U.S. and the Canadian government is about $8 billion. And it's six-seven and one-three.

KESTENBAUM: What Henderson is saying there is that as a result of the bankruptcy restructuring, General Motors only owes the U.S. government $6.7 billion. Now, that does mean that the rest of the $50 billion the U.S. invested is gone, because guess who owns 61 percent of this brand new General Motors company? We do, the taxpayers. That's what we got out of the bankruptcy.

So, the question is: What is that stock worth? Or, more importantly, what will it be worth? The stock isn't traded publicly yet, so there's no easy way to put a price on it.

Henderson says business is looking okay. September sales were abysmal compared a year ago, he says, but people still bought GM vehicles. The company captured one-fifth of the U.S. market.

Mr. HENDERSON: In an absolute sense, we weren't particularly happy given how weak the industry was, but our share performance was actually the best we had this year. And, you know, and I'd say so far October has shaped up okay, too. So, you know, good initial encouraging signs.

KESTENBAUM: By all accounts, General Motors was a mess before the bankruptcy. Steven Rattner, who led the U.S. auto taskforce, describes his experience in the current issue of Fortune magazine.

Rattner writes, quote, "Everyone knew Detroit's reputation for insular, slow-moving cultures. Even by that low standard, I was shocked by the stunningly poor management that we found. The top brass," he wrote, "were sequestered on the uppermost floor behind locked and guarded doors with elevator cars that would take them directly to their private garage."

So, will the taxpayers get their money back? John Casesa with the Casesa Shapiro Group says maybe. Casesa is a long-time auto analyst.

Mr. JOHN CASESA (Auto Analyst, Casesa Shapiro Group): GM would have to have a very impressive turnaround, and, you know, start to earn a lot of money -seven, eight, $10 billion a year.

KESTENBAUM: Recently, General Motors has been losing billions. Still, Casesa says, the company is in a much better financial situation now after bankruptcy, and he expects the car market will come back.

Mr. CASESA: Sales are running at an extremely, extremely low rate, and I am well aware of all the reasons why the economy may be weak for some period of time. But if sales were to bounce just to 13 or 14 million, which is still well below the historical sales level, they could start to make a lot of money.

KESTENBAUM: Here are some sobering numbers, though: At its peak, if you took all of General Motor's stock and added it up, the company was worth $57 billion. Remember, taxpayers now own a little over half the company, so if we want all our money back, General Motors will have to be worth even more than it was in those happier days.

Jeremy Anwyl is CEO of Edmunds.com, which analyzes the auto industry, and he basically agrees with Casesa's analysis: it'll be hard for taxpayers to be made whole. But if you ask him was the bailout a bad idea, he says it's hard to know.

Mr. JEREMY ANWYL (CEO, Edmunds.com): I mean, I'm of two minds, 'cause on the one hand, you know, I'm kind of old school. I'm not sure if government should be investing in business like this. On the other hand, I think the consequences here would've been pretty dire, so sometimes you just kind of hold your nose and do the right thing, even though, you know, in principle, it's probably something we shouldn't have done.

KESTENBAUM: It's possible, he says, doing nothing might have been worse.

**faster whisper:**
No one should expect overnight turnarounds.
Recognize the extraordinary progress that has been made since February
in the face of every pessimistic projection.
Be patient.
Give these companies the time and the space they need
and that we factor it into their recapitalizations
to remake themselves into successful companies.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today is Monday, October 26th.
That was Stephen Ratner.
I used to call him the car czar.
He's the former head of the Obama administration's task force
on the auto industry.
You heard him at the top.
He was speaking at the Brookings Institution
about the future for General Motors and Chrysler.
On the podcast today, we will have more on the government's involvement
in the auto industry.
But first, as everybody knows, the planet money indicator.
And it is today 2.9 percent.
We tried to find a good news number for you all today.
And what we came up with was 2.9.
That is the rate South Korea's economy grew in the third quarter.
That was the fastest rate in seven years.
Which, Alex, I think is an indication of how deep a hole we fell into.
But yeah, we are climbing out.
South Korea is climbing out anyway.
Yeah.
Well, wait till you be surprised when I put out my personal GDP numbers this week.
We had the crop of basil on the back porch.
It's doing quite well.
Oh, really?
You're looking at a strong Q3 showing?
We are, yeah.
Excellent.
All right.
Today on the podcast, we're going to try and answer an age-old question.
The question is, am I going to get my money back?
But specifically, we're going to talk about,
are the taxpayers going to get the money back that we used
to bail out the auto industry?
Actually, we're just going to talk about General Motors today
to try and keep things simple.
Frankly, before I started looking into this,
I had totally forgotten how much money we'd given them.
So as a reminder and a service for all the people listening out there
who might not be keeping track on all the bailout money,
here is the grand total to date.
According to the very helpful report by the Congressional Oversight Panel
last month, the U.S. government has put $50 billion into General Motors.
And after the bankruptcy, what we own is more than half the company.
61% of the stock of this new company is what we own.
There's also something else.
We gave some of this money as assistance, as loans,
and some of that still exists as loans.
So General Motors owes the taxpayers $8.8 billion.
It's some of the debt that General Motors still has.
And that $8.8 billion is part of the $50 billion total that we have put in.
So the taxpayers have put in $50 billion.
How much might we get back?
We're going to start off here with the CEO of General Motors,
Fritz Henderson.
Our colleague Adam Davidson and a small group of reporters
interviewed him recently.
Henderson said that though the overall auto picture doesn't look good,
he's gotten some encouraging signs.
If I just look at our performance in the market,
September, while we were down, we had an abysmal comparison
versus the September of the prior year.
We were down 45%, 48%.
We were comparing it versus our strongest month last year by far.
And our total share in the month of September was 20.6%.
So it was our best performance this year.
So in an absolute sense, we weren't particularly happy
given how weak the industry was,
but our share performance was actually the best we had this year.
So basically he's saying that our sales really stunk it up,
but everybody's did and ours were slightly better than everybody else's basically.
It sounds like what he's saying, right?
I think that's a fine interpretation.
Okay.
So the question is, will these encouraging signs translate
into U.S. taxpayers getting paid back?
Well, it turns out getting paid back is a little complicated.
One thing firms do when they want to pay off debts,
pay us back, pay people back, they sell stock.
But right now, GM stock isn't publicly traded.
You know, you or I couldn't buy that stock even if we wanted to.
And actually, I was poking around on GM's website all day today,
and it's actually sort of really interesting.
They have this investor FAQ there, and this is how they describe it there.
They say, quote,
There are currently no shares of General Motors Company for sale to the public.
It will initially be owned by the United States Treasury,
the governments of Canada and Ontario,
the UAW VEBA,
and Motors Liquidation Company.
And that goes on to say,
We expect that shares of the General Motors Company
will be publicly traded in the future,
and this may involve an initial public offering.
Okay, and just before we go on,
the UAW VEBA,
that stands for the United Auto Workers Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association.
That's the independent trust established to pay health care benefits
for auto industry retirees.
So when Adam Davidson talked to the CEO of General Motors,
Fritz Henderson,
Henderson said that he hoped to be able to pay back the debt,
that is the $8 billion that exists as a loan from taxpayers,
before 2015.
And then the next thing that would have to happen is that
they want to become a publicly traded company again.
So they would have to do an initial public offering,
and then the stock would be traded out there,
and there would be some value for the stock.
And remember, we own 61% of the company.
So then we would sort of know where we stand.
Right.
Now, it's pretty confusing,
and if you're all confused by this,
this long, complicated history of our involvement,
so are we.
And it's not just us, the laypeople that are confused,
even the experts are confused.
David, you interviewed John Casessa,
longtime auto industry analyst.
He used to be with Merrill Lynch.
Then a few years ago he started up the Casessa Shapiro Group.
Hi, can you hear me okay?
I'm all set.
Okay, great.
I'm embarrassed to say,
I'm fuzzy on the history at this point.
There's so much that has happened.
Well, I am too, and that's what I do for a living,
so don't be embarrassed.
Alex, I love it when interviews start that way.
I know.
So I asked John Casessa,
are the government and the taxpayers
going to get their money back?
And he said, he thought for a while,
and he said, maybe.
I mean, it all depends on what happens
to the value of the stock, right?
Because remember, we own 61% of it.
If you just look at how much money we put into it,
I mean, $50 billion in GM's case,
and therefore what the company would have to be worth,
you would back into some very ambitious earnings expectations
to produce a company that's got a really high market value,
so much so that the government can make a profit on this.
So it's a tall order.
How well would GM have to do for its stock
to be worth enough that when we sell it,
we get our money back?
You know, GM would have to have
a very impressive turnaround
and start to earn a lot of money,
$7, $8, $10 billion a year.
Now, you know, that's possible in a really strong economy
if the company is right size and has good products,
but at the very least, to do that,
it has to stop losing market share.
Its market share has to be stable.
I mean, right now, the reason it's difficult
to see that scenario playing out
is that customers are still defecting from GM, right?
I mean, you know that Ford is gaining a bit of market share,
and some of those are GM customers
that are switching to Fords,
and, you know, GM is losing customers to not just Ford,
but, you know, Toyota and Hyundai and everyone else.
But you do think it's...
I mean, I guess I was expecting you to say,
no, no, a lot of that money is totally lost.
It's a question of how bad it's going to be,
and you're saying it is possible
for the government to get its money back.
Just to give you...
It is possible because auto sales right now
are running at a 10 million unit annual rate,
and that equates to about 2% of GDP.
I mean, historically, the normal historical percentage
is about 4% of GDP,
so sales are running at an extremely, extremely low rate,
and I am well aware of all the reasons
why the economy may be weak for some period of time,
but if these companies, General Motors included,
are rapidly reducing their breakeven point,
and if sales were to bounce back just to 13 or 14 million,
which is still well below the historical sales level,
they could start to make a lot of money,
and they are...
They've massively cut their workforces.
They've massively, of course, cut their interest bill
by reducing their debt,
and at a mediocre sales rate of 13 or 14 million,
they should be able to make a lot of money.
So I think...
I think unless this economy just doesn't recover
in the next 36 months, which is highly improbable,
highly improbable, unless that happens,
I think there's a good chance
that the company could start to sell
at least the first installment of stock at a decent valuation,
and then over time, as the product pipeline builds
and all that happens,
each successive offering of stock
would come at a higher valuation.
Or they could go bankrupt again.
Yeah, if we double-dip, they could go bankrupt again.
I mean, listen, I mean, I apologize.
I'm not being clear here.
The government bought General Motors
probably three years of breathing room.
And if this company is able to implement
a really aggressive turnaround strategy,
along with the recovery economy,
there's a good chance that it could, you know,
it could return a chunk of money to the taxpayers.
But there are two big questions.
One, does the economy turn around
and give them some wind at their sails?
And two, can they really change their stripes?
And it's just too early to tell so far.
I mean, right now, the management hasn't changed.
The board's changed, but the management hasn't changed.
And so, you know, it's really a function of
what do they do with these three years?
I mean, we've averted a massive crisis
and bought a lot of time,
and now the outcome is dependent on
something uncontrollable, the economy,
and something controllable, the management.
What was the total value of GM stock
when things were good?
Well, I mean, at the peak, you know,
when the stock was $90, it would have been
about $50 billion in stock.
Well, but right now we own half the...
Maybe $55 billion.
Okay, so right now we own half the company,
and we are owed, you know, $50 billion,
so the company would have to grow to be twice
what it was at the peak, right,
for that stock to be worth that.
Well, yes, I mean, it would have to...
That's right.
I mean, it would have to be
a very successful turnaround.
Now, I have to say, even when GM was valued
at, say, $55 billion, the equity,
you know, was losing market share,
and it had building debt and all.
So, but, I mean, it's a good point
to recoup the U.S. taxpayer's investment.
This company would have to trade
at a public valuation, you know,
sort of its highest public valuation in decades.
So it definitely sounds like a tall order,
and in fact, the Office of Management and Budget,
that's the White House's Office of Management and Budget
and the Congressional Budget Office,
have both looked at this,
and their projections are that
taxpayers will probably get less than half
of the auto bailout money back.
That's the money that we, the taxpayers,
have lent to GM and Chrysler
and all the other programs.
And I think, actually, that's not so different
from what John Casessa is saying.
I mean, he's saying we might get it all back,
but it would take a lot of things to go right,
and there are some big ifs there.
So it sounds like the OMB and the CBO
are agreeing that there's a big if in there.
Right, and it just seems like basically
it all comes down to is GM ever going to get
to be the size that it once was, basically.
Yeah, are they going to come back in a big way?
And also, is the economy going to come back
so they can have people to sell those cars to?
Right, but even if the economy comes back,
they could continue to exist
and be a profitable company,
but just a much smaller company.
It's true.
I mean, they got Ford and they got Toyota
and they got everybody else.
Right, so maybe GM even does come back.
Maybe it is profitable,
but it's not going to ever reach the valuation
that it once had before everything went south.
Yeah, it could be a much smaller company,
and the U.S. government sells its stock
and takes a significant loss on its investment in GM.
Yes.
Well, I think that does it for us today.
There's a good report on all this
by the Congressional Oversight Panel.
That's the watchdog panel set up by Congress
and headed by Elizabeth Warren.
We will link to it on the blog, npr.org slash money.
We have one other note,
which is that if you are in the D.C. area,
Adam Davidson and I are going to be talking
at American University this Wednesday.
That's October 28th at 6 p.m. in the Westler Theater.
Tickets are free,
which is to say there are no tickets.
Seating is first come first serve.
So come on by.
We would love to meet you.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg.
Thank you very much for listening.
Thank you.
