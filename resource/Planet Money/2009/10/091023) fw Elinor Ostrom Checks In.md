This month, Indiana University professor Elinor Ostrom became the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics. Ostrom explains her groundbreaking research into the public management of natural resources. The political scientist argues that people should be empowered to organize themselves in small ways that scale up to a global network. Government can be helpful in doing that, but people shouldn't rely on it alone.

The political scientist argues that people should be empowered to organize themselves in small ways that scale up to a global network. Government can be helpful in doing that, but people shouldn't rely on it alone.

Tanya Dina Ruttenberg writes from WYPR land:

    Last winter my daughter was bitten by my neighbor's dog and had to get several stitches on her nose.

    It turns out the emergency room doc who stitched her up was an out-of-network provider. She charged about $800 and the insurance company decided the "reasonable and customary" (r&c) charge for the service was about $600. The reimbursement for out-of-network provider was about 70% so they paid her 70% of $600. It never entered my mind that this doc could be out-of-network since every other MD we've seen at this hospital was in our network. Moreover, the question of in or out of network didn't occur to me because we were in the emergency room and you don't get to pick your doctor in the emergency room!

    The insurance company processed it as an out of network claim and paid 70%.

    After a phone call to the insurance company they "remembered" their policy of paying as in-network for any emergency room visit. This means that they apply $250 to the in-network deductible and then pay at 100% of r&c. However, since the doctor was not really in-network, she had not agreed to accept what the insurance company said was reasonable and customary and persisted in charging $800. Her right to do as far as I was concerned.

    The balance therefore was $250 (deductible) plus the difference between "r&c" and balance the doctor said we owed her. Norm (the neighbor) was willing to pay the bills, but was concerned about how much it was and we agreed with him to appeal the decision of the insurance company to only pay "r & c". This totaled about $400 at this point.

    The insurance company denied the appeal and refused to pay anymore. So Norm was getting ready to pay the full balance, but decided to first consult a doctor friend of his who has ties to the insurance industry. Norm thought this guy might have some inside knowledge about how these things get paid/decided.

    Here is the email exchange between Norm and his friend:

    Letter from neighbor Norm to his doctor friend:

    My neighbor brought her daughter into the emergency room to get stitches in her nose from a dog bite. She had insurance from Guardian (?). She got a bill for some enormous amount and the insurance company at first refused to pay the physician portion of the bill because she was not one of their providers. After arguing about it they paid a portion of the bill but refused to pay $400 of it saying it was above the customary charges. It is not like she had a choice of who to see in the ER or ask what they were charging. Does she have any recourse?

    You are probably saying what am I so concerned about this for and that is a fair question. It was my dog who bit her and I am paying the bills.

    Reply from doctor friend:

    From a review of the data that you presented it appears that this was a true emergency and the definition of that status is important for the case. Aside from a deductible there should be no other obligation from the patient. It is irrelevant if the provider was outside of the panel of her insurance coverage in view of the emergency. If the charges were above customary, again the obligation should not extend beyond the deductible.

    Every insurance plan has an appeal process. If you were denied coverage at the initial level, you can request an appeal to the next level. Lastly, you can contact the insurance commission for the State of Maryland and file a complaint. You can also do this through the Health Department for the State of Maryland ( preferred route ). This complaint would be against the provider for excessive charges if this is true. On the other hand the complaint might be against the insurance company for denial of their fiduciary responsibility for the emergency care. Frequently insurers refuse to pay for services outside of their coverage responsibilities and claim charges exceed the usual and customary charges. The patient does not have an obligation to pay if the insurance company does not pay, even though the provider thinks otherwise.

    Norm agreed to pay the $250 deductible and no more. That was fine with us. This left a balance of a little less than $200 which I expected the doctor to settle on, but the collection company employed by the doctor refused to settle.

    I fully intended to file a complaint against the insurance company but never got around to it. I did not feel $800 was an excessive charge for stitching up my daughter's nose. If it wasn't done well she might have ended up needing cosmetic surgery (something Norm would have happily paid for had it been necessary). I feel the insurance company should have paid the bill in full.

    I never did file any complaint.

    What really ended up happening is that we are declaring bankruptcy for other reasons and the balance of this bill will be discharged in the banktruptcy.

CHRISTINA ROMER: Movements in the unemployment rate, either up or down, are likely to be small. As a result, unemployment is likely to remain at its severely elevated level.

(SOUNDBITE OF THE XX SONG, "ISLANDS")

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. That was Christina Romer, President Obama's top economic adviser, you just heard at the top of the podcast, saying, don't expect good news in the job market next year. On the show today, Adam, we've got a Nobel Prize winner telling us about fighting cows. First, we got to do our PLANET MONEY indicator.

DAVIDSON: Yes. The indicator today is 9.4%.

JOFFE-WALT: And that is, in September, there was a 9.4% jump in existing home sales, meaning homes that were not new homes.

DAVIDSON: This, for once, is actually really, really good news - highest jump in sales in two years, much more than anyone expected.

JOFFE-WALT: Except, of course, there are reasons not to get too excited. People were grabbing that tax credit before it ran out, the tax credit for buying your first home. So it probably made that number higher than it would have been otherwise.

DAVIDSON: But even with that extra boost, this does show that there is some health returning, we think, to the housing market. And it's certainly a change from the purely miserable news we've been hearing for so long.

JOFFE-WALT: Right, which is very nice to hear. So, Adam, I'm still feeling pretty happy about our interview with Elinor Ostrom yesterday. It was really - it was just fun to talk to her.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, I really enjoyed that. That was one of my favorite interviews in a long time. She won the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics a week and a half ago, and we didn't get a chance to talk to her until yesterday. But that meant she wasn't busy talking to every other reporter in the world. So we got to actually spend some quality time with her. She was at home, she told us, in the middle of writing her Nobel speech.

JOFFE-WALT: Right, which felt sort of exciting to catch her right in the middle of that. Elinor Ostrom shared the Nobel with economist Oliver Williamson. And we didn't get to talk to him. Maybe we will get to talk to him after they get the big medal.

DAVIDSON: So Elinor Ostrom is probably most famous for her work that questions this idea of the tragedy of the commons.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And I always felt like the tragedy of the commons, you know, was real because it just makes a lot of sense to me. So the tragedy of the commons says you have some common good like a pasture. And you have a hundred farmers that use it, and nobody owns it. So every time you have that kind of situation, a farmer is going to try to beat out the other guys by using as much as he can as quickly as he can.

DAVIDSON: You see things like this in lots of areas where a lot of people want to use something but no particular person owns it - so, you know, fishing in the oceans, you know, some public parks, the internet. Before Ostrom, the idea of the tragedy of the commons was generally seen as just the true state of nature.

ELINOR OSTROM: It goes back to a very influential and important article by Garrett Hardin published in 1968 in Science. And Hardin pictured a pasture, open to all, and posited that everyone would then put their cows on and try to get the grass off and they would overharvest. He identified a very important problem. Where he was wrong was that he then went on to indicate that the people involved were trapped in a tragic problem that they could not themselves solve. Solutions had to come from outside.

JOFFE-WALT: So the problem being that you have all these people, and you have one pasture, and there's no limits to how people can use it. So they overuse it, and they overharvest the pasture.

OSTROM: Yes, that was his - and that problem is still a problem. It's just not necessarily a tragedy. So that's why I say I want to make a distinction between the tragedy and the problem.

DAVIDSON: And just explain. What's the difference?

OSTROM: The problem is that people can overuse. It can be destroyed. And it is a big challenge to try to figure out how to avoid it. That's a problem. That's real. The tragedy is the way he expressed it. They can't ever solve it. That's different.

DAVIDSON: It's inevitable. It's unconquerable. I get you.

OSTROM: Yeah. That's why he called it tragedy. They were trapped. So he was right to identify this as a potential problem. He was wrong to indicate that people were helplessly trapped and that the only way out was some external government coming in or dividing it up into small chunks and everyone owning their own.

JOFFE-WALT: So Elinor Ostrom started to notice all these places where it seemed like the tragedy of the commons should hold. But it actually, it didn't. People were acting more as a community rather than everybody just grabbing as much as they could of a common resource.

DAVIDSON: The place she saw that really convinced her that the tragedy of the commons wasn't always and forever true was this farming area in the Swiss Alps.

OSTROM: It's a very interesting example and one that was important in my intellectual life because they have common property in the Swiss Alps. And they've had it for centuries. Those Swiss peasants own private land. They farm on private land. They own, communally, their alpine meadows. So the same persons know the benefit of private, and they're not using it in both places. They're very intelligent. They've had plenty of chance to make decisions over the centuries. And they've chosen common property. In the Alps, it's patchy. And so it snows well in one location and, in another one, not much. So one year, the pasture is rich and all up in the northeast corner. In the next year, it's in the western part. In the next year, it's in the southern part. And if you fenced it, then only one owner or two owners would get the lush area, and everybody else would be out of it. But if you kept a fence around the big commons, you could move the cattle to the lush areas.

DAVIDSON: So how did the peasants manage this? How do they make sure that people don't overgraze, that each individual farmer doesn't try to take too much?

JOFFE-WALT: And this is really the crux of her research, right, Adam? So it turns out that over centuries, the farmers, they came up with their own system. Each farmer owns their own land nearby, but they also have a right to pasture a certain number of cows in a common area. They figured this out on their own.

DAVIDSON: And the point, Ostrom says, is that this wasn't some rule imposed from above by, you know, the central government in Geneva or something. It was a local solution to a local problem. They came up with their own rules. And it became part of their traditions. And she said, by the way, that she really loves some of the traditions of Swiss Alpine farmers.

OSTROM: It was very interesting. I was in Switzerland and watched this. Cattle, if they're in the open like that, will follow a leader, a cow. And so they have a contest - and before they open the commons for the summer - of which cow is the strongest. (Laughter) And they really do have a contest. It's fascinating to watch.

DAVIDSON: Do they pull things or how do you figure out...

OSTROM: No, they put them head on, into a tussle.

DAVIDSON: Oh, really? Cows can...

OSTROM: Oh, yes.

JOFFE-WALT: And what happens in the contest? They test...

OSTROM: Well, they put a big number on each of them. And then they take two and they put them side by side. And, you know, I don't know how they get them to start the tussle, but whoever outperforms - they don't kill one another, but one will finally give up - whoever wins then goes on to a winner of another one. And so they'll have four or five of the tussles at one time. And then down - and it takes about several - two or three hours before they've got this all - they finally get the strongest cow of the whole group. And that becomes the leader. Then the cow herd, the herder - the farmer or farmer's son or daughter who leads the cows every morning - takes that one and leads it. And the others follow.

DAVIDSON: Wow. Now, what comes to my mind is...

OSTROM: Well, I haven't finished.

DAVIDSON: Oh, sorry, sorry.

OSTROM: Then every farmer has a cow, right? Those are very well posted. And since there is a shepherd who is responsible for taking the cows up - and then milking them and making the cheese and all the rest - there's a way of making sure that Farmer X has a cow right to five, only sends five. So they've got very low-cost ways of monitoring that the agreements are kept.

JOFFE-WALT: How do you go from - like, the tragedy of the common sort of makes intuitive sense to me, that if you had, you know, one area and everybody has a need for that pasture, that they would all act in their self-interest and eventually, you know, it would destroy it for the collective. How do you go from that instinct to do that to something like what you're describing, where you come up with a collective agreement?

OSTROM: Well, I think humans are a little more complex than you're making them out. The instinct to survive, yes, at the time of (gasping) very extreme difficulties and no trust - if I don't trust anyone else, oh, yes, that's my instinct. But humans have learned through the centuries, you know, you go way back into our early history where people had to hunt together. So in addition to our self-interest, we have grown up with a much more complex set of interests.

DAVIDSON: A critique I hear an awful lot of economics - certainly, mainstream U.S. economics - is that the core unit is an individual. And that individual is pursuing their own self-interest. Is your work predicated on individuals pursuing their self-interest but recognizing that their self-interest can best be pursued in the context of community? Or is your work saying something more radical, which is the core unit of understanding an economy, is the group and not the individual?

OSTROM: Oh, no, I'm not saying the core is the group. No. The core is still an individual, but the individual's a little more complex than the caricature of a me-first always. The me-first always caricature model can be used, mathematically, to predict outcomes when the problem is pure private goods and you have a highly competitive market. It works. So we don't want to throw it away as a model. But it is that we have to also then also understand that humans are more complex than immediate material self-interest as the only goal. And so, humans learn norms - and ways of expressing themselves, and the importance of love of brothers, and sisters, and their spouse and members of their community - and then, instead of taking my individual interest only into account, a human outside of a really narrow market situation can take a broader community into account.

DAVIDSON: But let's take that Swiss example - is the argument that each farmer is - I thought the argument was each farmer recognizes that they can maximize their output - or minimize the risk of not having the right part of the field in any particular winter - that they can maximize their output by being collective, by acting collectively? Which is different from them saying, you know what, I'm willing to forego a little bit of profit. I'm willing not to do as well so that the community overall does well.

OSTROM: Well, there are two parts to the argument. One - the first one, you mentioned - that they've found a solution that does enable them all to do better. They have. The second part of it is, but it was time and effort that they had to spend in a community deciding on that and enforcing it. And that requires - that's a second level collective action problem, if you want the technical. And their immediate self-interest doesn't explain it. Why should I go to a community meeting when they're going to go and they'll make a decision and I'll be better off?

DAVIDSON: Right. You could be a free rider on that. There's...

OSTROM: Sure.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Yeah.

OSTROM: And so to maintain and sustain a community agreement requires some forms of collective action.

JOFFE-WALT: So we are both self-interested, but we can also think about our future self-interest, and we also have some desire to work with one another.

OSTROM: Yes.

DAVIDSON: I have to say that I really love hearing what you're saying because first of all, it just sounds like the world I live in more than either the self-interest extreme or the collective extreme. What you're describing sounds...

OSTROM: Exactly. We don't - I mean, the group theorists were wrong (laughter). And the me, me, me, me only for everything we do are wrong. But it's - then people don't like it that we're talking about a more complex because sometimes it's hard to put into a mathematical model. Wait just a moment. No, I can't. Wait just a moment.

JOFFE-WALT: Sure.

OSTROM: I'm sorry. My husband just saw a beautiful, beautiful deer in our front yard, and he wanted me to go and see it.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: Well, that's...

JOFFE-WALT: Did you go see it?

OSTROM: Yes (laughter).

JOFFE-WALT: And what does it look like?

OSTROM: It's beautiful.

JOFFE-WALT: So we have a fridge here in the office. People bring in their lunch. There are - until just a few weeks ago, there were salad dressings that had been in there - looked like for many years. People bring little yogurts that were, like, green when you would open them up. And basically, it's just a trashed, packed full fridge that smells when you open it. To his credit, Robert Smith a few weeks ago, I think, took it on himself - a reporter here - to clean it out. But there is no, you know, system in which...

OSTROM: Well, create one. We have one for our fridge, and we have - we had to create our own rules. They're not university rules. They're our center's rules.

JOFFE-WALT: How does it work?

OSTROM: Well, for one, you can't keep food in the refrigerator overnight without putting your name on it.

DAVIDSON: And does someone enforce that every night?

OSTROM: Yeah, and - yeah, not a policeman, but any of us - if it starts to get crowded and there are things in there that don't have names, any of us can throw them away. It's the rule. Anyone can throw them away.

JOFFE-WALT: But why do you think that that happened at your...

OSTROM: Let me finish.

JOFFE-WALT: Sure.

OSTROM: Then we have a kitchen cleanup thing where all of us pitch in, and they - we have a calendar up on the refrigerator of who is supposed to do kitchen duty. We're all supposed to clean our own dishes. But every night, someone does a kind of final check. And we have a spatula that goes into our mailboxes on the day that we're supposed to do that.

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, really?

OSTROM: So we've - those didn't come overnight, but those have evolved over time. And we have pretty good kitchen.

JOFFE-WALT: So then I guess just my question is, like, what do you think it was about your particular group of people that made that happen, whereas NPR...

OSTROM: Well, we're studying all of this and aware of it and realize that if we didn't do it, we were dumb. And you guys have got to do the same.

DAVIDSON: All right.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

DAVIDSON: Because I've been promoting a federal clean your fridge law. I'm actually trying to get the U.N. involved, make it a...

OSTROM: Oh, well, then, yes, of course, that's the way to go. Of course - the U.N. I hadn't thought of that.

DAVIDSON: Right.

And Ostrom - you know, as I think is obvious - believes that solutions that are as local as possible - and whether local means, you know, the NPR New York bureau or the city you live in or the county or the entire country - what - however big the problem is, the solution should come out of that community, not a bigger one - not the U.N., not the federal government, if at all possible. And what I like about her is that, when you study Ostrom's ideas, they do have this practicality. It's like, you can just start applying them in your house, in your office, in your life right away.

JOFFE-WALT: Right, and it also really comes across that she's not an ideologue. She doesn't come up with, like, rigid rules. She just says that, like, her work shows that local folks can come up with really good solutions to collective problems, and it's often best not to impose those rules from above.

DAVIDSON: She says the basic thing that has to happen is some group needs to play the role of problem solver. They need to come up with the rules. And often, the group that can do it is the group itself - the group that's facing the problem. But she says she's been misunderstood a lot, that people take what she says in that context to mean she's just a fanatical libertarian and that government is never, ever, ever going to solve any problems. And as we found out, she does not have a lot of patience for people misinterpreting her in that way.

OSTROM: I've never said government cannot play that role.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And, in fact, what you're describing is...

OSTROM: Well, that's the oversimplification of mine. I'm just saying that relying only on a national government to solve every problem is a dangerous way of thinking.

JOFFE-WALT: So you're not saying government should never, ever regulate how we...

OSTROM: Correct.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Fish or divide up our land or...

OSTROM: Correct.

DAVIDSON: Or that government should always regulate.

OSTROM: Correct.

JOFFE-WALT: So Adam, one of the nice things about interviewing Nobel Prize winners a week and a half after they get the Nobel Prize is you can tell what questions they have been asked over and over that really, really piss them off. This was clearly one she has been asked many times and did not like. She is not against the government. We should make that clear.

DAVIDSON: Exactly. So I think that wraps it up for us today. Please send us your thoughts. Do you see the tragedy of the commons? Have you come up with a unique local solution to some community problem? Let us know at planetmoney@npr.org.

JOFFE-WALT: We're online at npr.org/money. We have a Facebook page. You can search PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
Movements in the unemployment rate, either up or down, are likely to be small.
As a result, unemployment is likely to remain at its severely elevated level.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Chana Jaffee-Walt.
That was Christina Romer, President Obama's top economic advisor you just heard at the
top of the podcast saying, don't expect good news in the job market next year.
On the show today, Adam, we've got a Nobel Prize winner telling us about fighting cows.
First, we've got to do our Planet Money indicator.
Yes, the indicator today is 9.4%.
That is, in September, there was a 9.4% jump in existing home sales, meaning homes that
were not new homes.
This for once is actually really, really good news.
Highest jump in sales in two years, much more than anyone expected.
Except, of course, there are reasons not to get too excited.
People were grabbing that tax credit before it ran out, the tax credit for buying your
first home, so it probably made that number higher than it would have been otherwise.
But even with that extra boost, this does show that there is some health returning,
we think, to the housing market.
And it's certainly a change from the purely miserable news we've been hearing
for so long.
Right, which is very nice to hear.
So, Adam, I'm still feeling pretty happy about our interview with Eleanor Ostrom
yesterday.
It was just fun to talk to her.
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.
That was one of my favorite interviews in a long time.
She won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics a week and a half ago, and we didn't get
a chance to talk to her until yesterday.
But that meant she wasn't busy talking to every other reporter in the world,
so we got to actually spend some quality time with her.
She was at home, she told us, in the middle of writing her Nobel speech.
Right, which felt sort of exciting to catch her right in the middle of that.
Eleanor Ostrom shared the Nobel with economist Oliver Williamson, and we didn't get to talk
to him.
Maybe we will get to talk to him after they get the big medal.
So Eleanor Ostrom is probably most famous for her work that questions this idea of
the tragedy of the commons.
Right, and I always felt like the tragedy of the commons was real because it just
makes a lot of sense to me.
So the tragedy of the commons says you have some common good, like a pasture, and you
have a hundred farmers that use it, and nobody owns it.
So every time you have that kind of situation, a farmer is going to try to beat out the
other guys by using as much as he can, as quickly as he can.
You see things like this in lots of areas where a lot of people want to use something,
but no particular person owns it.
So you know, fishing in the oceans, you know, some public parks, the internet.
Before Ostrom, the idea of the tragedy of the commons was generally seen as just the
true state of nature.
It goes back to a very influential and important article by Garrett Harden published in 1968
in Science.
Harden pictured a pasture open to all and posited that everyone would then put their
cows on and try to get the grass off and they would over-harvest.
He identified a very important problem.
Where he was wrong was that he then went on to indicate that the people involved

Solutions had to come from outside.
So the problem being that you have all these people and you have one pasture and
there's no limits to how people can use it so they overuse it and they over-harvest
the pasture.
Yes, that was his.
And that problem is still a problem.
It's just not necessarily a tragedy.
So that's why I say I want to make a distinction between the tragedy and the problem.
And just explain what's the difference.
The problem is that people can overuse, it can be destroyed, and it's a big challenge
to try to figure out how to avoid it.
That's a problem.
That's real.
The tragedy is the way he expressed it, they can't ever solve it.
That's different.
It's inevitable.
It's unconquerable.
Yeah.
That's why he called it tragedy.
They were trapped.
So he was right to identify this as a potential problem.
He was wrong to indicate that people were helplessly trapped and the only way out
was some external government coming in or dividing it up into small chunks and everyone
owning their own.
So Eleanor Ostrom started to notice all these places where it seemed like the tragedy of
the commons should hold, but actually it didn't.
People were acting more as a community rather than everybody just grabbing as much as they
could of a common resource.
The place she saw that really convinced her that the tragedy of the commons wasn't
always and forever true was this farming area in the Swiss Alps.
It's a very interesting example and one that was important in intellectual life because
they have common property in the Swiss Alps and they've had it for centuries.
Those Swiss peasants own private land.
They farm on private land.
They own communally their alpine meadows.
So the same persons know the benefit of private and they're not using it in both
places.
They're very intelligent.
They've had plenty of chance to make decisions over the centuries and they've chosen common
property.
In the Alps it's patchy and so it snows well in one location and another one not
much so one year the pasture is rich and all up in the northeast corner and the
next year it's in the western part and the next year it's in the southern part
and if you fenced it then only one owner or two owners would get the lush
year and everybody else would be out of it but if you kept the fence around
the big commons you could move the cattle to the lush areas.
So how do the peasants manage this?
How do they make sure that people don't over graze that each individual
farmer doesn't try to take too much?
And this is really the crux of her research.
Right Adam? So it turns out that over centuries the farmers they came up with
their own system.
Each farmer owns their own land nearby but they also have a right to pasture a
certain number of cows in a common area.
They figured this out on their own.
And the point Ostrom says is that this wasn't some rule imposed from above by
you know the central government in Geneva or something.
It was a local solution to a local problem.
They came up with their own rules and it became part of their traditions.
And she said by the way that she really loves some of the traditions of Swiss
alpine farmers.
It was very interesting. I was in Switzerland and watched this.
Cattle if they're in the open like that will follow a leader, a cow.
And so they have a contest and before they open the commons for the summer
of which cow is the strongest and they really do have a contest.
Do they pull things or how do you know they they put them head on into a tussle?
Oh really? Cows can?
Yes.
And what happens in the contest?
Well they they put a big number on each of them and then they take two and
they put them side by side and you know I don't know how they get them to
start the tussle but whoever out performs they don't kill one another
but one will finally give up.
Whoever wins then goes on to a winner of another one and so they'll have four
or five of the tussles at one time and then down and it takes about several
two or three hours before they've got this all.
They finally get the strongest cow of the whole group and that becomes
the leader.
Then the cow herd, the herder, the farmer or farmer's son or daughter who
leads the cows every morning takes that one and leads it and the others follow.
Now what comes to my mind is...
Well I haven't finished.
Oh sorry sorry.
Then every farmer has a cow right.
Those are very well posted and since there is a shepherd who is
responsible for taking the cows up and then milking them and making the
cheese and all the rest, there's a way of making sure that farmer X who has a
cow right to five only sends five.
So they've got very low cost ways of monitoring that the agreements are
kept.
How do you go from...
Like the tragedy of the common sort of makes intuitive sense to me that
if you had one area and everybody has a need for that pasture that they
would all act in their self interest and eventually it would destroy it for the
collective.
How do you go from that instinct to do that to something like what you're
describing where you come up with the collective agreement?
Well I think humans are a little more complex and you're making them out.
The instinct to survive, yes, at the time of very extreme difficulties and no
trust.
If I don't trust anyone else, oh yes, that's my instinct.
Humans have learned through the centuries.
You go way back into our early history where people had to hunt together.
So in addition to our self interest, we have grown up with a much more
complex set of interests.
A critique I hear an awful lot of economics, certainly mainstream of U.S.
economics, is that the core unit is an individual and that individual is
pursuing their own self interest.
Is your work predicated on individuals pursuing their self interest but
recognizing that their self interest can best be pursued in the context
of community or is your work saying something more radical which is the
core unit of understanding an economy is the group and not the
individual?
No, I'm not saying the core is the group.
No.
The core is still an individual but the individual is a little more complex
than the caricature of a me first always.
The me first always caricature model can be used mathematically to
predict outcomes when the problem is pure private goods and you have a highly
competitive market.
It works.
So we don't want to throw it away as a model.
But it is that we have to also then also understand that humans are more
complex than immediate material self interest as the only goal.
So humans learn norms and ways of expressing themselves and the
importance of love of brothers and sisters and their spouse and members
of their community and then instead of taking my individual interest only
into account a human outside of a really narrow market situation can take
a broader community into account.
But let's take that Swiss example is the argument that each farmer is I
thought the argument was each farmer recognizes that they can maximize
their output or minimize the risk of not having the right part of the
field in any particular winter that they can maximize their output by being
collective by acting collectively which is different from them saying you
know what I'm willing to forego a little bit of profit.
I'm willing not to do as well so that the community overall does well.
Well the two parts to the argument one the first one you mentioned that
they found a solution that does enable them all to do better.
They have the second part of it is but it was time and effort that they had to
spend in a community deciding on that and enforcing it and that requires
that's a second level collective action problem if you want the
technical and their immediate self interest doesn't explain it.
Why should I go to a community meeting when they're going to go and
they'll make a decision and I'll be better off.
Right. You could be a free rider on that.
There's no you know.
And so to maintain and sustain a community agreement requires some forms
of collective action.
So we are both self interested but we can also think about our future
self interest and we also have some desire to work with one another.
Yes I have to say that I really love hearing what you're saying because
first of all it just sounds like the world I live in more than either
the self interest extreme or the collective extreme.
What you're describing sounds like we don't.
I mean the group theorists were wrong and the me me me me only for
everything we do are wrong but it's been people don't like it that we're
talking about a more complex because sometimes it's hard to put into a
mathematical model.
Wait just a moment.
No I can't.
Wait just a moment.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
My husband just saw a beautiful beautiful deer in our front yard and
he wanted me to be able to see it.
Did you go see it?
Yes.
And what does it look like?
It's beautiful.
So so we have a fridge here in the office it people bring in their lunch.
There are until just a few weeks ago there were salad dressings that had
been in there looked like for many years people bring little yogurts that
were like green when you would open them up and basically it's just a
trashed packed full fridge that smells when you open it.
To his credit Robert Smith a few weeks ago I think took it on himself a
reporter here to clean it out but there is no you know system in which.
Well create one.
We have one for our fridge and we have we had to create our own rules
they're not university rules there are centers rules.
How does it work?
Well for one you can't keep food in the refrigerator overnight without
putting your name on it.
And does someone enforce that every now and then.
Not a policeman but any of us if it starts to get crowded and there are
things in there that don't have names any of us can throw them away.
That's the rule.
Anyone can throw them away.
But why do you think that that happened at your work?
Let me finish.
Then we have a kitchen cleanup thing where all of us pitch in and we
have a map we have a calendar up on the refrigerator of who is
supposed to do kitchen duty.
We're all supposed to clean our own dishes but every night someone does a
kind of final check and we have a spatula that goes into our mailboxes
on the day that we're supposed to do that.
So we divide those didn't come overnight but those have evolved over
time and we have pretty good kitchen.
So then I guess just my question is like what do you think what do you
think it was about your particular group of people that made that happen.
Well we're studying all of this and aware of it and realize that if we
didn't do it we were down and you guys have got to do the same.
All right.
Because I've been promoting a federal clean your fridge law.
I'm actually trying to get the UN involved make it a.
Oh well then yes of course that's the way to go.
Of course the UN I hadn't thought of that.
And Ostrom you know as I think is obvious believes that solutions that
are as local as possible and whether local means you know the NPR New York
Bureau or the city you live in or the county or the entire country what
however big the problem is the solution should come out of that community not
a bigger one not the UN not the federal government if at all possible.
And what I like about her is that when you when you study Ostrom's ideas
they do have this practicality it's like you can just start applying them
in your house in your office in your life right away.
And it also it also really comes across that she's not she's not an ideologue.
She she doesn't come up with like rigid rules.
She just says that like her work shows that local folks can come up with
really good solutions to collective problems and it's often best not to
impose those rules from above.
She says the basic thing that has to happen is some group needs to play
the role of problem solver.
They need to come up with the rules and and often that the group that
can do it is the group itself the group that's facing the problem.
But she says she's been misunderstood a lot that people take what she says
in that context to mean she's just a fanatical libertarian and that
government is never ever ever going to solve any problems.
And as we found out she does not have a lot of patience for people
misinterpreting her in that way.
I've never said government cannot play that role.
Right.
And in fact that you're describing is a vacation of mine.
I'm just saying that relying only on a national government to solve every
problem is a dangerous way of thinking.
So you're not saying government should never ever regulate how we correct
fish or divide up our land or correct or the government should always
regulate correct.
So Adam one of the nice things about interviewing Nobel Prize winners a week
and a half after they get the Nobel Prize is you can tell what questions they have
been asked over and over that really really pissed them off.
This was clearly one she has been asked many times and did not like.
She is not against the government.
We should make that clear.
Exactly. So I think that wraps it up for us today.
Please send us your thoughts.
