On today's Planet Money: Adam Davidson chats with the intrepid David Kestenbaum about both the theatrics and real policy debates going on at the current climate conference in Copenhagen. First, meet a biker who powers up music with his feet for outdoor dance sessions and, with the late Friday announcement that a global agreement of some sort has been reached at the conference, listen to the potential promises and pitfalls of a key aspect of the deal — a "cap and trade" carbon reduction plan.

**faster whisper:**
The United States is prepared to work with other countries toward a goal of jointly
mobilizing $100 billion a year by 2020 to address the climate change needs of developing
countries. Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson. And I'm Khanna
Jaffee-Walt. Today is Friday, December 18th, and that was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,
you heard at the top of the podcast, and she was giving us our Planet Money indicator, Adam.
A hundred billion dollars. Yes, there it is. So as of this moment, Friday afternoon, it's
12, almost one o'clock, 1250, December 18th. That's New York time, which means it's 650 in
the evening Copenhagen time. I'm picturing a David Kestenbaum going out to dinner with
some of his reporter friends, maybe not quite yet, but soon. Right, definitely involving some
beer. And meanwhile, the heads of 192 countries in Copenhagen, they have not decided on a way
to save the planet. We were going to actually hold the podcast today until we had something to
report, but it's now becoming clear that today we are not going to have anything to report on
any shocking last minute agreement on climate change. I guess we could hold the podcast
till Sunday to see if something happens then, and then probably not from what we're hearing.
So maybe we should just hold it for 14 years or so. Let's just air it.
Okay. And we did have some things that we wanted to talk about. We've been hearing a
lot from David from Copenhagen, and a lot about how just because it's climate change,
it doesn't mean that it's not all about the money. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has
left a lot of money on the table on Thursday and waiting for China to basically throw down as
well. And as of this recording, 1252 now, it is still sitting there.
$100 billion just burning a hole in some table in Copenhagen. We called our own dearly
beloved and much-missed David Kestenbaum in Copenhagen earlier to talk about the
difficulties of figuring out how much all of this climate change stuff will cost the world.
$100 billion, $200 billion, who knows? But also he says at the core of the debate is
not these big, big $100 billion numbers, it's how much is just a ton of carbon worth?
Probably a lot less than you thought. But the bigger question is how do you
create a market to figure out what a ton of carbon would be? But actually the most fun
in talking to David was just finding out what it's like when you put all in one giant convention
center, all these heads of state and all these like really serious sober policy wonks and a
whole bunch of earth activists all together. You will have our top diplomatic negotiators
walking out of meetings and then passing people who are dressed as polar bears or
have life preservers around their necks. And it's just everybody's all in this total mix.
What's the craziest thing you've seen?
Well, you know, there was this huge protest over the weekend and it was like, I don't know,
40,000 people or something walking from downtown out to here. And I thought I just,
I was working so I thought when they get here, I'll walk out there. And it was a little bit
late. And by the time I got out there, there were actually only, I would say like 12 people
left all around a fire that they built in the middle of the street out of their protest
signs. Some of them were quite funny. They said, there is no planet B, meaning this is the only
planet we have. And actually I think there's music playing and I realized the music was being
powered by a guy on a bicycle. Like he'd rig this generator off a bicycle so he could
bike along. And while he was biking, it would also charge the battery and it was spitting out music.
Can I talk to you while you're dancing? Sure. You can keep dancing if you want. It's hard to talk though.
Tell me what your sign says. It says, emission is not a good. Shouldn't it be emission is not a good
thing? No, emission is not a good as like you cannot sell it or buy it. Because they are making
this emission trade, which is a bad thing because then like rich countries would buy or sell their
emissions to poor countries. So Adam, what he's upset about is that this idea, the way economists
view this whole problem of climate change is that we need to put a price on something invisible
and that invisible thing is a ton of greenhouse gases, a ton of carbon. The whole problem,
that's the way an economist would look at this. It's not that the glaciers are melting. It's
that there's no price for carbon emissions. I live in New York City. If I put my recycling out
wrong, the city charges me a fine. If I pollute a river, I'm charged a fine. There's some fee
for the pollution. But for carbon, there's no fee for that. It's just what economists call an
externality, an uncaptured externality. I'm a factory or whatever. I cause carbon pollution
and that's free to me. And as we know, when something is free, we overconsume it. If the
price isn't accurately assessed, we tend to overconsume that thing. So factories overconsume
the pushing out of carbon into the environment. Is that the basic idea?
So the common way, the way that everyone talks about dealing with this is through something
called cap and trade. So what's something you want to limit? Just give me an example. What's
annoying to you? What's annoying to me is bad Hollywood movies. Bad Hollywood movies. Okay,
so we want to limit the number of bad Hollywood movies. So we will have bad Hollywood movie
permits and we're going to put a cap on the number of bad Hollywood movies. We'll say
they're only, how many should we limit it to? Like three? I feel like teenagers need
something to go to. So let's say 10 a year. Okay, so the government puts out 10 bad Hollywood
movie permits and Hollywood now has to fight over those, right? Because they all want
to make it. So then there's some value attached to that. Sony is going to Universal
and saying, I'll give you 12 million for that bad movie permit.
So it's the same idea with carbon. You know, the government would put out carbon
permits and then people would buy and sell them. So I mean, it's sort of a strange
idea, right? Because you're putting a price on this invisible gas. And I talked
to Janet Peace here. She's an economist at the Pew Center and she admits it. It is a
kind of strange idea. It is a strange idea. It's not a soybean market. We're not creating
a market for soybeans. It's a created market. So what we're trying to do is actually
incentivize those reductions by means of a price. What you're saying is basically
the price of electricity is wrong right now because it does not include this other thing,
which is that by the way, you're doing damage to the planet with the emissions.
Absolutely. There's a correction. Really, you're correcting the price of everything
else in the world. We're trying to include or put back in that price. So people think
about that price when they make their decisions, when they look at what kind
of factor they want to build in the future, when they look at what kind of car they
might want to buy in the future. We want them to think about that price when they
make their decision. So Adam, actually, you know, a carbon market exists because
the European Union has a cap and trade system in place. And if you go to this website,
pointcarbon.com, you can actually see the price and it's around $21 a ton right now.
And it goes up and down. It kind of tracks the global economy, the stock market,
because with the recession, there was less demand for electricity, so less demand for
less carbon was going to be emitted, so less need for pollution permits and the
price went down. It goes up and down like a real market. But there are difficulties
because it's a completely artificial market, right? It's not like soybeans or
corn or something. It depends on how many permits are out there, which are set by the
government. So I ran into this guy, Dirk Forrester, who is with a company called Nat
Source, and he used to work on their, basically, like on their trading desk,
helping set up trades. And he told me about, if there's a problem with it,
this is the problem, is that in order for companies to really trust these
carbon credits and for the market to really work, they need certainty. You know,
that's what they hate is uncertainty. If the government were to start,
you know, saying it's going to only have a certain number of permits, then it
really changes its mind, like that sort of thing would create a problem.
What would frighten traders is if governments reached in and said,
ah, we're going to ease things up a whole lot, or we're going to tighten
things up a whole lot. They really like to be left to make a market
work and to do what they can do best, which is bring the efficiencies
to it, really, by finding opportunities. And, you know, if this market works
well, you'll have people crawling all over the United States looking for
ways to reduce emissions so that they can make a buck. And that's a
pretty cool thing to unleash. And we've never seen it in the U.S.,
but when I was living in Europe, I saw an industry sprouted up overnight
of people that crawl around looking for ways to reduce emissions.
So they're thinking, like, if Republicans get elected, suddenly
there's more carbon permits, and the price of carbon goes way down.
So if President Obama is president, but I think maybe a Republican will
be president next, I'm not going to pay for a permit now.
Is it, it kind of messes, the more politics in the market,
the more it messes up the pricing.
Yeah, because it's not like you're just wondering, you know,
what is the weather going to be like for growing oranges next year?
You know, it's more like, who's going to get elected?
And are the laws we have in place going to stay in place?
Are our targets going to change? You know, it could get really complicated.
So we're Planet Money, our focus is applying economics
to everyday life and to big global problems.
And so what you're saying is, for all the argument about,
are the polar bears going to go extinct?
And does China have more responsibility here?
Or does the U.S. have more responsibility?
And it really comes down to a very simple thing.
A ton of carbon, which you said sort of fills a big hot air balloon,
has to have a price. We need to know how much that is.
When I think of a ton of carbon, I immediately think of some big
factory belching out carbon.
But the point is that even though I don't run a factory,
I actually, I produce carbon, right?
We all produce carbon in our day to day life by what products we buy,
whether we drive or not, whether we, you know,
whether we lower our thermostat, all that stuff.
Right. So this would all change all those prices too, right?
Electricity, presumably, would get a bit more expensive.
You know, driving your car would probably get more expensive,
you know, because gasoline would be more expensive.
And, you know, that's how it's supposed to get everybody to reduce emissions.
The average American puts out a ton of carbon about every two weeks.
So every two weeks, you directly and directly are responsible for putting
about the amount of carbon dioxide that would fit in a huge
hot air balloon into the atmosphere.
That's your personal contribution.
Think about that every two weeks.
Okay. So if it's 20 bucks for a ton of carbon,
and I'm doing 20, so 40 bucks a month, I can handle that.
That's not so bad. I could pay 40 bucks a month to save the environment.
All right. Send me your check.
I mean, is that a way to think about it?
That at the end of the day, this might cost more, but it's not going to cost.
It's like a buck a day. It's like, you know,
what we ask people to give to public radio.
Yeah. I've actually been talking, they do a lot of,
there are a lot of models about the economic cost of dealing with this.
And, you know, if you're an employer, though, suppose you're making
steel or aluminum or something that requires a lot of electricity, right?
Then your costs of electricity have gone up.
And so maybe you can't hire as many workers.
I mean, it's fairly complicated, but then there are new jobs,
you know, people building wind farms or solar panels.
And so sorting through all that is difficult.
All right. But I got to say this conversation is making me feel like,
okay, this will mean stuff will cost more,
at least stuff that's involved in polluting.
It'll also mean that maybe our economy will grow a little slower,
but it's manageable. It sounds like the numbers you're talking about.
They're big, they're scary, they're politically hard, but they're not crazy.
Like it doesn't mean that poor people will never become rich people
and that I will never have more money than I do today.
It's all manageable.
It's certainly manageable for us as a rich country.
I think the question is, you know, what's the impact on the poorer countries, right?
You know, a small hit to the GDP of India, obviously,
a lot of people who are going to get electricity that year
might not get electricity that year, right?
So that's the real question.
India is saying you can't slow down our growth, like it's just too painful for us.
You know, if you want to make us do something more expensive,
you have to help us out.
And I just have to wait another year for the new cool iPhone or whatever.
I'm okay with a little slower growth.
I think you have to wait another week.
It might be another week or a day or something.
I think that's how much it slows down the US economy
in over 10 or 20 years or something, yeah.
All right. David, come home. We miss you.
Okay. I'll see you soon. Thanks.
See you soon, bye.
What radio was that?
National Public Radio.
The United States.
Can I greet the Risi family?
Yeah, yeah, go ahead, yeah.
Greetings to the Risi family in Taft from there, George.
In where are they?
In Taft, California.
I say, okay, thank you.
So Adam, negotiations are still happening right now.
They're still going on.
And I just got a dispatch from our guy on the floor, David Kastenbaum,
that I want to just read.
So he wrote me this email and says,
Hey, Chana, I just woke up from taking a nap on the floor here.
Obama and Wen Zhaobao just met one on one for a second time.
The leaders of the two largest greenhouse gas emitters.
I can't imagine what the conversation is like.
Everything kind of hinges on them at this point.
The US wants China to put its pledge in writing.
China doesn't want to.
Obama says there's no way to verify
if anyone is living up to their pledge.
It's all empty words on a page.
And there's a draft circulating now.
Just four pages of text.
It lays out some stuff that's been emerging in the last few days.
In particular, that developed countries pledge to create
a climate fund of $100 billion a year by 2020
to help developing countries.
But it's unclear where the money will come from.
And it's the low end of what some developing countries had been seeking.
We'll see.
Love, David.
Thank you, David.
We love you too.
And that sounds like that's slightly less depressing
than the impression we had earlier.
I'm not going to call it less depressing now.
Same depressing.
Same depressing.
I think that does it for us, Khanna.
OK.
You can find us online at npr.org slash money.
And as always, our email, planetmoney at npr.org.
I'm Khanna Jafi-Walt.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
