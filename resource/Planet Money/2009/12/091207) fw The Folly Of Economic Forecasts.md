Russ Roberts, George Mason University economist and host of EconTalk, explains why he thinks is economics is an imperfect science. Roberts says he has come to believe it's impossible to predict future economic conditions because good data is so hard to come by and even harder to compare. So what about all his fellow economists who seem to have an opinion on almost any topic? Roberts says they should come out and tell the truth, that their policy recommendations are based on philosophy and ideology, not on empirical data.

**faster whisper:**
TARP has turned out to be much cheaper than we had expected, although not cheap.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Khana Jafiwal.
Today is Monday, December 7th, and that was President Obama speaking during a meeting
with the Turkish Prime Minister you just heard at the top of the podcast.
And today on the podcast, Adam, why you should never, ever read an economic study again.
Yep.
Planet Money is going to fold up after today's podcast.
There's no point.
Forget all those terms and numbers we don't understand.
Economics is not rooted in science.
Don't need it.
Number one number, you always need the Planet Money Indicator.
That's right.
The indicator is $200 billion.
That is a big number, a hard number to wrap your mind around.
The Obama administration came out with this number today, and Adam, why don't you explain
what we're supposed to make of it?
Okay.
So, in August, the White House told us this trouble asset relief program where we
gave $370 billion to the banks and gave all that money to Chrysler and General
Motors and AIG.
We're going to lose $341 billion.
We taxpayers.
Well, today, they said, oh, my goodness, we were wrong.
We're only going to lose $141 billion at most.
So yeah, we're going to lose a lot of money, but it's $200 billion less than
what we thought we'd lose a few months ago.
So it's almost like we just made back $200 billion, except not really because
we thought we were going to lose it.
Okay.
On the podcast, we are going to be talking to Russ Roberts, an economist at George
Mason University.
And I've known Russ for a long time.
He's a friend.
And I have been listening with intense interest to his podcast, Econ Talk.
I find it a really interesting podcast.
I mean, Russ is very open about his own views.
He's sort of rooted in the Chicago free market school, very much a
devotee of Milton Friedman's.
He's moved to George Mason University, and he's shifted a lot more towards the
Austrian School of Economics, which is also free market.
It's similar to the Chicago school, but there's all sorts of differences.
But what's interested me is over the last year or two, he's been questioning
the very nature of economics and questioning his own views.
Are his views based on facts that he has learned through
empirical research, or is it just ideology?
I found it so interesting, I gave him a call the other day.
Well, I have my own philosophical views.
I have my own policy perspectives, my own preferred solutions to various
policy problems, right?
What's changed is that I don't delude myself into thinking that the reason
I hold my views is because I have better evidence on my side.
My studies were the ones that are done well.
The other side, those studies, they missed this, they left that out.
This was mismeasured.
That's a crummy study.
That's what they rely on.
I think they're all not so good now.
Even the guys on my side who purport to claim that this policy or that
policy is the right one, their empirical work's not so good either.
So I remember a few years ago, I was doing some reporting on the minimum
wage, and there's these two claims.
Minimum wage causes unemployment among the people who can least afford it,
and no, minimum wage helps those people.
And to me, it seemed easy and obvious.
All I have to do is find the studies, and the studies would tell me.
But what I found is left-wingers had studies that made a case that
minimum wage helped, and right-wingers had studies that made the case
that minimum wage hurt.
That's right.
And I couldn't really know.
Yeah, and you're not an economist, so which one's right?
What's the right answer?
You have dueling studies.
So those of us who are closer to the kitchen who know how those studies are
done, we'd look at them and we'd say, we can always poke holes in all of them
on either side.
I can tell you what's wrong with the studies by Card and Krueger that
found that the minimum wage actually helps employment among low-skill
workers, and the other side has critiques of my side that says that,
no, no, no, it hurts the workers who it's trying to help.
So the question is, what do you do?
And you'd think, as you did more and more studies, you'd get better and
better answers, closer and closer to the truth.
Because that is what happens in natural science.
If we didn't know the gravitational constant, you just drop a bunch of
things in a vacuum, eventually you're going to figure it out.
That's right.
And I would argue that in economics, we struggle to try to mimic that
precision and progress that we see in other sciences.
And there's a reason for it, and this is what's important.
One of the reasons that that's true is that our data are very imperfect.
By definition, a worker who's working eight hours on the job today in 2009
has a very different experience than a worker in 1950 who worked eight hours
a day.
Just to take this as an example, there's a lot more leisure on the job
today.
It's not the same amount of work, really, even though you're on the job
eight hours a day.
A year of education, we often are looking at the relationship, say,
between education and the minimum wage, or education and earnings.
A year of education today is not the same as a year of education 20 years ago.
My year of education studying economics may not be the same as your
year of education studying physics or psychology.
There are going to be different additions to my skill set, but all we
have perhaps in the data is he went to school for a year.
So those issues are unavoidable in economics.
They're very different than, say, in physics, where you can locate where the
moon is right now, or you know how high a mountain is.
And a hydrogen atom in 1953 is a hydrogen atom in 2009.
Pretty similar.
That's one reason we struggle to be as precise, but the other reason is much
more interesting, and I think much more profound, and that is that
economic systems are complex.
They involve the interaction of agents who are people who are trying to
achieve certain ends in flawed ways.
We're all imperfect.
On top of that, we have the rules and regulations of the legislative and
legal system and all the norms and cultural things that we carry along
with us, and we don't really understand those interactions in a scientific way.
We like to think we'd have them.
We model them.
We write equations, but the things we're trying to model are not like
electrons.
They have a mind of their own, and we don't fully observe them the way
we do, and electrons, of course, physics has a similar problem with where
electrons are.
I don't want to overstate the precision of physics.
They've got their own uncertainty.
But the implications for things like building a bridge, we can ignore that.
But in economics, if we want to know whether the stimulus package is going
to work, we ignore those that are apparel, or if we're going to try to
figure out how to make the financial system better and we're going to say,
well, let's just raise these capital requirements, and we don't fully
understand what that's going to do to, say, the political economy, the
interactions between executives on Wall Street, members of Congress,
lobbyists, and the rules they pass, we're going to make some really bad
policy errors, as we've seen.
So I make an analogy between financial crashes and airplane crashes.
Airplane crashes, we get better and better at preventing them.
We study the data.
We see what caused them.
We learn.
We then improve how we build our airplanes and how we build our
regulatory system.
It gets better.
We get fewer crashes per mile every year.
It's extraordinarily and wonderful.
We don't get fewer financial crashes per decade.
In fact, we seem to be getting more.
And they're more violent.
They are, and there's more destruction.
So we've got more data.
We've got a lot more people studying it.
They're more economists than ever before.
They're still pretty smart people.
Why don't we get better at that?
Why can't we design a better financial system the way we can
design a better airplane system, an airplane traffic control system,
say, or the way that airplanes are maintained, how frequently?
We can't do it.
And it's because it's an inherently more complex system than an
airplane.
And we shouldn't pretend that they're the same kind of problem.
But we do.
We pretend that they are, which means we get a false sense of
hubris of how we can solve things rather than deal with the
reality of how they are.
So why do we need economists?
You guys don't know anything.
Get rid of them.
We don't need economists for predicting.
I think it's dangerous, just to take an example, to
predict how many jobs are going to
create it by this stimulus.
The CBO studies of this are not really very reliable.
For example, they just evaluated the job gains from
the last stimulus.
They said it ranged from 600,000 to 1.6 million.
Now, does that strike you as a scientific range?
One number two and a half times the other number?
And they'll confess it isn't really an estimate.
They just use the constants that they have observed in
past recessions.
So it's just a guess.
It's not a scientific estimate.
So what do we need economists for?
Well, what we need economists for is to remind us, one,
to have less hubris.
That's very important.
Not to be overconfident about what we can build.
For that, I can buy a t-shirt.
Have less hubris.
Yeah, well, that's not bad.
It's strikingly difficult to remember to have less hubris.
So I'll put a plug in for us there.
But I think the deeper thing we understand are
fundamental principles.
Things like there's always trade-offs.
So that if you say, want to reform health care by
subsidizing health care, and then at the same time
hold down costs, that's kind of like developing a
fuel-less car, a car that's going to get more miles to the
gallon, be lighter, and be free.
I mean, it just isn't going to happen.
It violates the fundamental laws of economics the way a
pig that can fly violates the laws of physics.
We do have certain important core fundamental
insights into how people interact that are
good to remember.
So trade-offs is always true.
That there's no free lunch is always true.
That people respond to incentives.
But it's complicated, because you have to look at how
those responses then affect things and what happens
after that.
Those are the essence of economics that almost all
economists agree on.
So they all agree on that.
What they don't agree on is the policy implications.
And I would suggest that some of those policy
differences, some, all, almost all, are ideological
and philosophical, not scientific.
So why are you still basically a libertarian?
Why not take this and go, oh, I'm going to make no
ideological commitments, because I don't think they can
be based on anything.
Well, I think they are based on something.
I think our ideological commitments are based on
fundamental beliefs or understanding of how the
world works.
It's just not based on fancy econometric studies.
So my overwhelming belief on why markets are good is my
fundamental skepticism about how government works.
Now, I can't prove in a scientific way that government
is prone to special interest corruption, that regulation
is prone to capture, that politicians are no better
than anyone else.
They're human beings who pursue their own
self-interest.
But I think it's true.
It is confirmed in casual ways by the evidence of
the world around me.
But I don't have a fancy study to prove it.
Having said that, I don't want to argue that facts
don't matter.
Facts do matter.
Information does matter.
What I'm talking about is the gussying up of that
information in fancy forms that academic
economists use in their journal articles, which
usually are not reliable.
So I feel like hearing Russ talk, I mean, first of all, I
just like it when someone questions the fundamental
nature of their profession and their way of life.
There's nothing very satisfying about that.
But I also wonder if there's a simpler way to think
about economics, that it's good at what it's good at
and it's not good at what it's not good at.
And so economics is lousy at predicting the future.
Although there's an obsession with economists
predicting the future, and that economists should be
able to, and that for the whole field to have any
value, it needs to be predictive.
It makes me think of meteorologists.
Meteorologists are not very good at predicting the
weather.
The seven day forecast.
The seven day or the 21 day, or what will the
weather be in 2011?
Just like economists don't really know what the
economy is going to be like eight months from now.
But if you want to understand wind patterns and
clouds.
And clouds and how rainfall works, they probably have
some insights.
So maybe we don't have to throw out the entire
field of economics.
You might read another economic study again.
We'll see.
We'll see.
All right.

indicator we had at the top, the $200 billion
dollars and what to think about it.
