**faster whisper:**
The winner is Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the most powerful, least
understood government force shaping our lives.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. It's Wednesday, December 16th. I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Klanna Jaffe-Walt. And that was Richard Stengel, managing editor of Time Magazine,
you heard at the top of the podcast. Today, Alex, on our show, a U.S. regulator cracks down.
Three years too late. But first, let's extend our congratulations to Ben Bernanke,
Time Magazine's Person of the Year, as you just heard at the top. And that also brings us to
our Planet Money indicator, direct from the man himself, Ben Bernanke, the indicator 0.25%.
That's the funds rate from the Federal Reserve released just hours ago. We got it in on our
special Planet Money emergency phone. Yeah, I don't know if listeners actually
know that the Fed calls us every time it has a special announcement. If that cherry red
phone is ringing, we know it's the Fed. Yes, they like to keep us updated.
And today they were saying, we are not, nor do we have future plans to raise interest
rates. And this is not a huge surprise. The Fed is still worried about the economy. They
want to keep money moving. Speaking of special red phones, though, we at Planet Money,
we are very interested in crime fighting. And something we've been noticing a lot is that in
the wake of this financial crisis, there's been no major investigation into just what happened
inside these banks on Wall Street. Were there things that were done wrong? Was the law broken?
Or even are there things that just we now think maybe the law wasn't broken,
but things should be changed? Yeah, all we really got was Bernie
Madoff. Yeah, and those two Bear Stearns hedge fund guys that were recently acquitted
of all charges. And that's not nothing, but they're sort of isolated incidents. There's
no comprehensive investigation that is designed to figure out what went wrong
and who is accountable and what should be changed.
Instead, Alex, we are doing those investigations here at Planet Money.
Right. And we've been working with the stellar investigators over at
an outfit called ProPublica. It's a nonprofit investigative reporting unit,
something of a new model in journalism. They take super talented former reporters from places
like the Wall Street Journal, and then they pay them to do reporting and hook up with people
like us, sort of partner with people like us. Yeah, so we've been picking into one
corner with them where we think there was a lot that went on and not much information has
really come out about it. The CDO industry. So all the people who are involved in creating
and marketing and buying the most toxic of the toxic assets.
And frankly, we thought we were the only ones looking into this corner.
Until recently, our friends at ProPublica came across a letter, and it's a letter from the SEC,
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator for the CDO industry.
So, Hannah, you and Adam sat down with our ProPublica friends, Jesse Isinger and Jake
Bernstein in the studio here. And Jake brought the letter, which he shared with us. And it
was a letter, again, from the SEC to CDO managers, which is one group within the CDO
industry. It's really a general letter of inquiry. It's broken into a number of different parts,
and it's very broad based. It's stuff like, you know, can you furnish us a list of clients
between January 07 and September of 09? Can you provide trustee reports from each CDO that
you've worked on from January 1st, 2007 to the present? Can you tell us your organizational
chart or description of your organization, including ownership percentages? You know,
things like that that are very sort of basic questions is trying to understand
your company and your role in this market. So it's basically a regulator saying to the people
that it regulates, what do you guys do? Yeah, what do you guys do? How do you do it?
And who are you? Who are you? How have you operated in the past? You know, some of this
might be an attempt to lay down a baseline, understand what the industry norms were during
this period so that if there are bad actors, they'll be able to see how they stuck out from
everyone else. And we're certainly not saying all CDO managers are shady or all CDO managers
are responsible for the crisis or anything like that. What we are saying is that CDO managers,
if you don't understand them, you really don't understand this financial crisis. So
let's start there. What are CDO managers? What do they do? Maybe we should just start very
quickly with what is a CDO. Oh yeah, that would be good. At the beginning, there was light and
dark. There was a mortgage. And the mortgages were created by mortgage banks and sold to
Wall Street. Wall Street bundled them, hundreds of them, into those mortgage-backed
securities. Then they sliced them up and gave them to investors based on their appetite for
risk. And then they took those securities, those slices, and smashed them up into another security
called a CDO. Those are mortgage- Collateralized debt obligations.
Yes. Thank you. You hear collateralized debt obligation, you just picture it. You
just know exactly what it is. The scales fall from there.
You can do it with loans, bank loans. You could do it in the old days with bonds.
The biggest business over the last several years was in mortgages and especially subprime
mortgages. All right. So Merrill Lynch or some investment bank says, all right,
we want to sell CDOs to investors around the world. Let's call a CDO manager. That guy
will choose what investments to buy to create the CDO and will also kind of be a mark of a
seal of approval assigned to investors that Merrill Lynch isn't going to screw them.
Exactly. And so they, Merrill would or Citi or any of the CDO investment bank would take
the CDO manager on the road show the marketing tour across the world that they would go on to
advertise this investment to investors. Investors were pension funds, insurance companies,
foreign banks, and they would say, look at the CDO manager. They are independent and they do all
this analysis of what's going into this CDO. So they work hand in hand, but the CDO manager
was supposed to be this watchdog for the integrity of the CDO itself. Every CDO has lost
money, right? I mean, that's all. Almost every single one has lost money and many,
many of them have been completely obliterated. And most have lost a fair amount. We're talking
about pennies on the dollar. Since 2003, over $600 billion worth of CDOs were issued and at
its peak, the CDO market in 2006, it was about $250 billion. Just in that year alone.
Just in that year alone and most of that value has been wiped out.
So Jesse, I want to make clear, first of all, we have not, the SEC would not respond
to our request for an interview. Right. They never comment on
ongoing investigative matters or anything like that.
So we do not know what they know. And there might be a secret room somewhere where they know
everything you could possibly want to know. And they're just,
we don't know what's going on with this letter. It might just be an anomaly.
One would think they'd know the answers to these questions in 2003, 2004, 2005. This
was probably, I would guess, one of the fastest growing sectors of Wall Street. So
clearly something that they should have noticed. But let's give them a pass on that and then say,
okay, but once the crisis started unfolding in early 2007 and then really hitting it in August
of 2007, they should have, one would think they would have jumped on this.
Well, it's clear under the Bush administration that the SEC suffered greatly, mainly from
mismanagement, especially under Christopher Cox. Christopher Cox, it was widely reported,
was absentee during the height of the crisis when banks were going down
and was largely cut out of the whole effort to save the banks.
And it's an agency that's demoralized and in disarray.
Mary Shapiro has come in and done a massive reorganization and house cleaning.
The most obvious and acute scandal was the Bernie Madoff scandal. The SEC had
examined Madoff several times and missed most of the red flags with his Ponzi scheme. And so
that has been probably the largest scandal in SEC history. So Shapiro has had a huge
problem on her hands to really right the ship.
And Jake, the Bernie Madoff scandal originally reported to be in the 50 billion area. I think
now it's probably more something like 19 billion that was lost. It's a huge, embarrassing
scandal, but that is nothing compared to the overall financial crisis. But I don't think you
win a lot of political points by talking about CDO managers. I mean, nobody even knows what a
CDO is. It's really hard to explain, but it's pretty easy to understand Bernie Madoff was a
crook. Right. And it's easy to show intent when Bernie is forging investment receipts and
trades and things like that. So you know that he's doing something criminal. I mean,
as the Bear Stearns trial showed, it's very hard to convince a jury that there's an intent
to defraud. The argument that I think most of the players in the financial industry will use
is that they were just bad businessmen and that there's nothing criminal about that. They
just, you know, they all believe something and it turned out to be wrong. But I also think,
Adam, as you said, this business grew so quickly. 600 million worth of mortgage-backed
CDOs. In 2006, there were CDO managers popping up all over the place who were eager to take on
these CDOs and make what seemed to be easy money. So I think the SEC was just completely
behind the ball on this. They weren't able to react quickly enough to understand what was
going on. And I think that's part of the reason why there's such a lag now. You know,
there's sort of a scattershot approach because I think they're really trying to assemble a
picture of what happened. So Jake, we're really thrilled that Planet Money and ProPublica is
working on this ongoing investigation into the inner workings of Wall Street during the bubble
years, things that may or may not have led to the financial crisis, and we're going to be
bringing more reports in the future. What do you want to know, though? You know, a lot
of people listen to Planet Money who work on Wall Street or did work on Wall Street during
the bubble years. What would you love to know? Well, we certainly want to hear from people
who are involved in the production and sale of CDOs. Certainly, we've talked to a number
of CDO managers, and we'd love to talk to more of them to really understand how this process
worked and how the relationship between the CDO managers and the banks operated. Think of this
as a pledge drive. So you can email us at planetmoneyatnpr.org. We're perfectly willing
to take your information anonymously. We don't need to report your name. Jake and I have
set up an email at cdos.propublica.org. If people want to be anonymous or whatever,
you're more than happy to do that. It's really starting to sound like a pledge drive.
So that's right, only with your help. Planet Money and ProPublica bring light to darkness.
Well, guys, I can't wait for, hopefully soon we'll have some really cool stuff to report.
Jesse Eisenger and Jake Bernstein, reporters at ProPublica. Thank you both.
Thanks a lot. Wow. So that letter, I think my feeling is everybody knows the SEC is basically
as much as admitted that they were behind the ball in the beginning. I think the ball was
dropped. The ball was dropped, for sure. But my feeling is, well, better late than never. I'm
glad that they're at least starting to send out a letter now. It would be nice to piece
together some parts of this story. Right. And I feel like one of the things that's interesting
and one of the things that I think we're going to be looking into later is that,
as the Bear Stearns case shows you, a lot of what happened probably wasn't criminal or maybe
wasn't criminal. It's certainly hard to prove a criminal case. But that doesn't mean it
shouldn't be investigated. And I feel like that's one of the problems here. There's
things that need to be investigated, but there might not be a criminal at the other end of
it. Right, because the Bernie Manifes of this world are very satisfying to find, but
there are also maybe lessons to find in just sort of the larger, structurally understanding
what happened and how it worked and what we can change. Right. And it's very possible that this
crisis was not caused by a criminal. In fact, very likely that at the heart of this crisis
were not criminals, masterminds, you know, like fiendishly rubbing their hands together.
There was just people doing their jobs and maybe cutting corners here and there, but not
breaking the law. But perhaps with new regulations in place, the system could still be
made safer. So we would love to hear again what you know you can write to us at Planet
Money at NPR.org and the ProPublica email special email set up is CDOs at ProPublica.org.
