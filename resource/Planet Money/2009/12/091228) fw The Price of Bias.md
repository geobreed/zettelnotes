We may think of our independent press today as being the result of political awakening and noble efforts by those seeking truth, but that's not the whole story. University of Chicago economist, Matthew Gentzkow, says we've progressed not just because of good intentions, but because of basic economics. Gentzkow explains how advances in printing helped newspapers expand their audience beyond just one political party.

**faster whisper:**
How can you come to New York and not shop?
That was the main reason for today.
If we were at home, we would definitely be beating from the 50% off sales at our local
department stores.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt.
Today is Monday, December 28th and on the show today, Alex, we're going to be talking
about one thing, one, I have to say, pretty unexpected singular technological advance that
transformed American media.
And we are not talking about the internet.
Oh, man, because I have a lot of things to say about the internet.
I really think it's going to have a transformative impact.
We're not going there today.
Sorry.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
First, we need to do our indicator.
And it has to do with a conversation that we've been having here around the office.
You were talking about the pizza, aren't you?
You can't let it go.
It is crazy.
It is insane.
So the indicator is $30.
That's right, $30 for one pizza pie.
I went to this place, Lucales, in Brooklyn, New York.
And I should explain that right after the very next day, Adam Davidson went to that
same pizza place and ordered the same pizza.
After hearing me rant about the $30 price.
And he said that the pizza was totally worth $30.
In fact, it was the most delicious pizza he'd ever had.
Which is absolutely not true.
Anyone listening out there knows $30 is way too much to spend for a pizza no matter
how good.
Right.
And the point is you guys can't let it drop.
In fact, you bring it up even when you're doing interviews together.
That's true.
It is how we started talking to Matthew Genskow.
He's an economist at the University of Chicago.
He came on to talk to us about something that has nothing to do with pizza.
But we had to start by asking him that.
What is the most that I would pay for one pizza pie?
Gosh, really depends how good it is.
It's really, really good.
It could be a lot.
On the right day, I would pay, I don't know, $25, $30.
So I went to this pizza place that's down the street from my house.
And it was $30 a pie, which I thought was pretty outrageous for a pizza no matter
how good.
And Adam went to the same place last night and thinks that I'm crazy.
I would definitely pay $50 for that pizza.
I think on the right night when I'm hungry enough.
So that means I'm $20 richer, right?
What economists call that?
Consumer surplus.
You're getting more of it in this case?
Consumer surplus.
Yeah, that I would have paid $50.
I only had to pay $30.
Yeah, I think you're doing pretty well in that case.
So I can tell my wife that every time I eat there, I'm $20 richer.
Yeah, I don't know how that makes her better off at all, but it seems pretty good
for you.
OK, Alex, with that settled, Adam and Matthew Genskow are both insane suckers.
We can move on to the real question that we brought Genskow in to answer.
So here is that question.
There used to be a time, a time not too long ago, 100 plus years ago, when our
country's newspapers, they would have mission statements.
They would just come out with mission statements like, our goal is to serve and
promote and advance the interests of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.
It was totally accepted that newspapers were completely partisan.
And not only that, they would take money from those political parties.
The questions we ask today, is MSNBC biased, is Fox biased, is NPR reporting biased?
No one asked those questions because they would have been seen as stupid
questions.
Everyone knew all the major outlets were biased.
Right, everyone completely expected that newspapers were biased.
And so the question that we had was just, you know, how did we go from that
not that long ago to what we have today, where, you know, say what you will about
bias in our newspapers.
We all think bias is a bad thing.
We expect that news media should not take money or bribes from politicians,
shouldn't be funded by one particular political party.
You know, basically, how did we get an independent press?
And Genskow told us an interesting story about how that happened.
To start, he said, you have to go back to the 1870s.
Newspapers in the 1870s were partisan in a way that makes partisan media today seem
quite balanced and independent.
Most newspapers in 1870 were explicitly affiliated with a political party.
And what were the articles like?
Yeah, I think there was, again, just a degree of explicit partisanship that would
be, I think, quite surprising to people used to reading modern newspapers.
So they were like really, really emotional, worked up editorials.
We looked at one scandal, the Credit Mobilié scandal that happened in 1870.
And so this was a case, basically, of some people bribing congressmen.
And the newspapers on the side, on the Republican side that were defending the
Congress people said things like, this is a libel invented by knaves and
retailed by fools.
There were lots of ad hominem attacks on the editors and publishers of the
opposing newspapers.
There was lots of very heated rhetoric.
And how did the money work?
So not only would you be a newspaper in, say, you know, the newspaper of
Springfield, and you would say my mission statement is to advance the
Republican cause, but you would also be taking money in order to do that.
Sure.
So there were a few different ways that money flowed from the Republican
party to the Republican newspaper in Springfield.
The most important was probably the awarding of these printing
contracts by the government.
So there would be these provisions in the law saying that all of the laws
that were passed, various other proceedings of government had to be
published for public distribution or for various kinds of distribution.
And so probably the single most important way you channeled money to
newspapers was giving them those printing contracts.
There were also jobs.
I think newspaper publishers were often made postmaster general, which was
a very lucrative and not all that demanding job.
And then there are also examples of private individuals who were running
for office, who were privately financing newspapers for pretty
clearly political reasons.
So if I'm the Republican paper in Springfield, if I fulfill my
mission of promoting the Republican cause, which I most likely believe
in myself, I may get a lucrative printing contract.
I can get donations from that guy running for reelection or this
new young Republican up and comer to give me money.
And I may get to be a postmaster.
So there's a lot of benefits.
And now that the Democrats in Springfield, they might not buy my
paper, but that's okay with me because I'm making tons of money
from my Republican friends and funders.
So Genskow says, as with anything in 1870, publishers were doing
a basic cost benefit analysis.
If I was publishing a newspaper in Springfield, I had to weigh what kind
of content is going to win me the largest readership in Springfield
against the possibility that some of the stories I might report would
anger or be against the interests of the party that I was partially
funded by moving a little bit in the direction of independence or
nonpartisanship typically was associated with winning more readers.
So that newspaper faced a trade off between can be a little more
partisan, which is going to make the party happy or be a little bit
less partisan and potentially increase our readership and
profits from selling newspapers.
So we have the 1870s, we have these, this newspaper in
Springfield that is making this calculation that the trade off
between getting this government contract where I can print my
paper versus the readers that I'm losing because I'm putting out a
biased product that that's working for me.
I figured out the balance there.
And then you described that that changed a little bit over the
next couple of decades.
That balance really shifted.
Yeah.
So there were a number of really important changes.
The first, I think, was just the cost of printing
newspapers fell dramatically.
So there were innovations in technology.
Probably the single most important was figuring out how to make paper
from wood pulp.
So in the 1850s or 1860s, newspapers were printed on rag paper
like linen, like basically like linen.
Yeah, exactly.
Which was really expensive.
So newsprint in 1870 cost, I think, in today's dollars,
something like twenty five dollars per pound.
And by 1920, the cost had fallen to more like five dollars per pound.
Wait, there was paper was not like wood based until the 1880s.
Yeah, that's correct.
I think in 1867, the process for making paper from wood pulp was invented.
The wood pulp paper was not at all durable, but it was really, really cheap
and conducive to the printing newspapers.
The telegraph was introduced in 1844, which meant that the amount of
information newspapers had at their disposal to print was much, much bigger.
And there were big increases in literacy over this period.
So the number of people who could buy and read a newspaper grew.
Putting all those things together, they meant the money you could make
by running a newspaper grew exponentially on both sides.
The supply was cheaper and the demand was greater.
Exactly. There were there were more people.
There were more people who could read them.
The quality you could produce because of the telegraph and so forth
was higher. The cost of printing it was lower.
And just as you would expect, what that meant was there was a huge increase
in the number of newspapers, prices of newspapers fell.
And so all of all of that together meant that the newspapers
were a very profitable business.
So now if I'm that publisher in Springfield, things have changed for me.
It's a lot cheaper for me to print my paper and there's more people
that I can reach and there's more people who are interested
in what I'm putting out.
Yeah, exactly. So that tradeoff you were making between catering
to the interests of a political party or trying to make money
by selling newspapers has tilted pretty dramatically in the direction
of you might want to try to sell some newspapers.
Because because that government contract to print the newspapers
isn't as big a deal to me anymore, given that I can make
some of that money by just selling my paper to more people.
Exactly, exactly.
So the the lesson here is is wood pulp has given us our independent press.
Our idea of press is being independent.
Hannah and I owe the very idea of our jobs to cheap wood pulp.
I think that that's perhaps a slight oversimplification,
but probably true.
So pretty close to the truth.
I mean, this story is so crazy.
And the thing I love about it is that you can imagine it.
The hearing is like, you know, the march towards progress
and towards the independent press.
And it has to do with like political awakening and grand,
you know, these grand causes.
When really, it's just about like it's all based on wood pulp.
It's all just about wood pulp.
You know, and I find it interesting to think about the story just,
you know, the way he frames is an economic tradeoff.
It sort of makes sense that publishers respond to demand
and to what we, you know, the consumers want.
And the incentive is not necessarily, like you said,
this grand strengthening our democracy or telling the most true real story
but rather it's just about what you lose if you don't do that.
Now, of course, we assume being creatures of 2009, almost 2010
and not of the 1870s, that we are better off
because we have an independent press.
Our reporters are not taking bribes from politicians.
If that did happen, we would think it was very scandalous and very wrong.
Right. Which is just when you took that bribe, I told you,
I think that's scandalous and wrong, remember?
Just like I said, pizza shouldn't be $30.
Exactly. We all have our moral compass.
Right. And we think that this means in the end,
we get a truer picture of what is actually happening.
And, Hannah, you and Adam asked Genskow about this, right?
Right. Because that seems obvious, like an independent press means
you get, you know, less bias, a more true story.
But we're just sort of curious, like, was it possible in the 1870s
if I was just your average citizen and you have the Republicans,
you know, calling the Democrats liars and corrupt and vice versa
on the front page and, you know, both sides probably printing lies
in their own papers that they fund about each other.
But was it possible to actually get a true sense of what was happening?
Do we get more access to the truth with our independent press than they had?
It's not at all obvious which of these things is better.
There's an analogy to the way we run courts in this country
where we don't appoint a single attorney whose job is to present
an unbiased, balanced view of the defendant's case and the prosecutor's case.
We say we want to have one attorney whose job it is to just represent
the defendant and one attorney who's going to do everything they can
to represent the prosecution.
And you can think of the kind of press we had in the 19th century
as similar, a kind of conscientious reader who really wanted to get both
sides of the story and who would go out and read both the
Democratic newspaper and the Republican newspaper,
could have learned most of the facts involved and potentially even more
facts than they would have learned if they had an independent newspaper.
The problem is, of course, that most readers didn't do that.
And so it's a very different thing.
If you had if you had a courtroom where, you know, half of the jury
only listens to the defense and half of the jury only listens to the
prosecution, then this kind of adversarial judicial system doesn't work very well.
So, Alex, the obvious thing that I kept thinking through this whole
conversation is how, you know, 100 plus years ago, our news media
was transformed and it was all thanks to this one moment, you know, one guy
kind of or maybe a woman in a room inventing wood pulp.
And that totally transforms the way our news is distributed
and in turn, what the news is.
And of course, here we are today in exactly the same moment.
I knew we would get to the Internet because I have a lot of thoughts
about the Internet. I really do think it's going to be transformative.
But it is the same thing, right?
There's some, you know, some military scientists in the 1960s
create this ARPANET, which eventually becomes the Internet.
Right. And the way that the Internet has transformed media is really under covered.
Alex, I hope that you do get to it.
But, you know, there is going to be revolutionary.
Mark my words.
And if you think about it there, there is also this cost benefit
trade-off that's changing things.
You know, it's much cheaper now, again, to distribute content.
And it's also created this environment in which it's expected that that content
is free. So that is a story that we will not.
Talk about now.
Right. And that is it for us today, as a matter of fact.
Coming up on Wednesday, we are going to talk about the Internet
and one small, interesting idea for making money in our current
media world.
And this is an idea that is shifting the cost benefit calculation.
