Figuring a little cushion couldn't hurt, West Virginia's Centra Bank got involved in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Then CEO Douglas Leech decided the restrictions weren't worth the hassle and moved to repay the money. Getting out cost the healthy bank $750,000, for complicated reasons.

On today's Planet Money:

-- Figuring a little cushion couldn't hurt, West Virginia's Centra Bank borrowed $15 million from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Then CEO Douglas Leech decided TARP's restrictions weren't worth the hassle and moved to repay the money. Getting out cost the healthy bank $750,000, for complicated reasons. Now David Kestenbaum has the chance to live his radio dream: Stopping his NPR story midway so he can explain it for the rest of us.

-- When the Treasury announces the results of the banking stress tests this week, says Douglas Elliott of the Brookings Institute, we'll be looking at numbers based on a lot of information and a slew of judgment calls. Elliott, who's got a new paper out on the tests, says the real test for the economy isn't the toxic assets, but the growing defaults on far more ordinary loans.

-- It's tough out there for a clown. Mandy Dalton takes apart the business of buying $300 shoes for entertaining kids in the middle of a deep recession and a swine flu panic.

Marc Chandler, a currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, sent over a primer on President Obama's announcement about a move to end overseas tax shelters for companies. Chandler says he's all for the plan.

The counter-argument, I'll just say, is that the economy depends on the free movement of capital and that companies are supposed to maximize profits, including by moving capital overseas and seeking every legitimate tax advantage.

Back to Chandler's primer, which is a touch technical but not frighteningly so. It starts with a "check the box" rule that took effect in 1997:

    Initially adopted to reduce paperwork (and who is not in favor of that?), it allowed business to classify their corporate structure in the most tax efficient (minimization?) without triggering an IRS challenge. These rules, so the critics argue, were gamed and multinationals apparently created subsidiaries whose sole purpose was to shift profits to low tax countries. One the corporate assets were in in the low tax country, the multinational parent would borrow from the subsidiary. The interest payments were deductible from the US tax and tax fee in the tax-havens.

    The Clinton Administration, which had initially adopted the rules, quickly realized their shortcomings and tried to rescind them, but ran into blow-back from companies and their legislative allies.

    The other parts of Obama's proposals are reportedly modeled on proposals form the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 2007. These include a proposal to defer most expense deductions, including for interest paid, until the US tax is paid on the foreign income. Under current practices, a US company can deduct 35% of interest paid to a foreign-based subsidiary that owes little or no tax to its host country. Obama seeks to close this window for tax arbitrage, which in effect reduces the corporate tax burden at the expense of the US Treasury. The Obama Administration appears to be compromising here as some wanted an outright repeal of these rules.

    Another part of Obama's plan addresses the foreign tax-credit rules. US rules gives companies a dollar tax credit for every dollar in foreign taxes it pays. US companies are projected to use this rule to "save" about $4.3 bln a year.

    The key point regarding the Administration's plans is that they can still be rejected by a blue-ribbon panel appointed by Obama and led by Paul Volcker. Like other developments in the new Administration, panels and reviews are conducted, but the President is not waiting for them to conclude before moving ahead.

The Obama administration says shuttering the tax havens will generate something like $210 billion over 10 years. Chandler puts the number closer to $190 billion.

**faster whisper:**
I don't doubt that this is unpopular. It's unpopular here. This is, the President didn't
come here to, as he said, run auto companies or bail out banks.
Hey, welcome to Planet Money. I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt in New York City. And I'm David
Kestenbaum, also here in New York City. We are one big happy Planet Money family
this week in our New York Bureau. Everybody is here. And David, I like getting to see your face over there.
Same here. I actually had no idea what your face looked like.
A little fatter than you thought.
No, it's the blue hair that threw me.
All right, David, this show, we know we promised we'd get to GM. We are going to do that a little later this week.
We have some other stuff we want to get to first, like a little dance party remix of a piece you did, David.
It has to do with a banker boy scout and how the government messed him over.
That's how he feels, right?
Right. But first, we have our Planet Money indicator. It was actually a tough pick today.
There were new construction numbers, new housing numbers, but we're going to go with this.
Eighty seven percent.
That's a tweet we got from a clown. She works in the Baltimore, D.C. area.
And eighty seven percent. That's how much business has dropped off in January to April.
Which, of course, raises a lot of critical questions, such as what exactly are the expenses involved in running a clown business?
Right. And what is the plan B for a clown when business goes down?
So Caitlin Kenny just had to follow up on that tweet, and she did. And we're going to have that in a little bit.
But first, the remix, David. This is something that I always want to do with radio stories, particularly business and finance stories,
where there's all these little details packed into four little minutes.
And, you know, it's like you're listening to all things considered and this great story is playing and it's making sense.
And then it just sort of is not.
Thanks very much.
You know, it makes sense, but there's a little detail that you just want to go, wait, wait, stop, explain that.
David, I loved your piece last week, but I was hoping you wouldn't mind playing the start stop game with me a little bit today.
Yeah, for your fat face, huh? Sure.
OK, here we go. It's about this little bank.
It took tarp money, decided it wanted to give it back and the bad things that happened.
Let me tell you about Centra Bank in West Virginia.
Douglas Leach, the CEO, helped found the place back in 2000 by maxing out his credit cards and mortgaging his house.
It is not a big multinational bank. It's a community bank.
Leach says he's never done subprime loans.
When we make a loan, we can see the collateral, the businesses.
We see them open their doors and close their doors in the evening.
We go to church, to school with our neighbors, and that's where our business has been done.
Also, he promises if you call, an actual human being will answer before two rings.
Thank you for calling City for Bank. This is Megan. How can I help you?
That was one ring.
So Centra was more than healthy, even with all the economic troubles.
And when the government unveiled its tarp program to lend money to banks, Leach thought it sounded like a good idea.
Tarp was seen as a bailout for the big troubled banks, but it was also meant to help healthy banks keep lending.
Receiving tarp funds was really like a merit badge kind of in the Boy Scouts.
It was being made available to only the strong banks.
And you, in fact, may not be looked at quite as favorably if you didn't receive the tarp.
Centra filled out what Leach remembers as a three-page form.
And pretty soon, the Treasury Department wired the bank what amounted to a $15 million loan.
The government got $15 million of preferred shares that paid 5% dividends.
But okay, you can just think of it as a loan at 5%.
The Treasury also got what are called warrants, and we'll get to those in a minute.
But for the moment, everyone was happy.
The bank had a little bigger cushion and more money to work with.
But then Leach says Congress threatened to change the rules.
There was talk about putting restrictions on how the tarp money could be used,
restrictions on taking over other banks, for instance.
So Leach called Treasury and said Centra wanted out.
They said, we understand.
We're developing the process to exit the program.
We don't have those details worked out.
They told me that I was the first banker to call them.
Centra wired back the $15 million plus a little interest to Treasury.
That went fine.
But then there was the issue of those warrants.
Under many tarp contracts, the warrants give the government the option
of buying stock in the bank at a set price.
The idea was that if a bank recovered and its stock recovered,
the taxpayers would make some money.
But Centra Bank is a private bank.
And the way these warrants were set up to protect the taxpayer,
the warrants let the government pay $750 for
preferred stock worth $750,000.
Wait, okay, stop the tape there.
Thanks.
I have some questions, David.
We got a lot of questions about this particular part,
which is why would a bank ever enter into this kind of deal?
It just sounds insane, right?
Right.
All right, so we're going to play it out here.
Okay, I get to be the small, charming bank owner.
All right, I get to be the Treasury Department with the big wallet,
which I'm taking out now.
So I'm going to give you, look, I have $15 million.
Here you go.
Wow, cool.
And you're going to have to pay me 5% interest on that.
Okay, sounds like a good deal.
And you have to give me those warrants.
Wait, I'm paying you interest on the loan.
Isn't that enough?
No, because we really want to protect the taxpayer.
So I'm going to also get these warrants from you in here.
I made a form for you to fill out spelling out the terms.
Great, okay.
It says warrant in big capital letters, I,
and you can write a fat face bank or whatever you're called.
All right.
Promise to give the Treasury Department, that's me, $1,000
in preferred stock for $1.
And then just sign it there.
All right.
So now give me the warrant.
And you're actually going to give me 1,000 of these.
And okay, the deal's done.
I'm actually going to use my warrant already.
I will give you all these 750 warrants.
And they're each $1.
I have to pay $1.
So I'll give you $750.
And you have to give me $750,000 in preferred stock.
Now, here is where it gets confusing.
David, it kind of seems like I'm getting ripped off here.
Right, so why would a bank ever, ever do that, right?
And why did so many banks do this?
Because they did.
And the reason it makes sense for the banks to do this
is that the interest rate on the loan, on the $15 million,
is so low that even though you fork over these warrants,
which is painful for you there, right,
in the long run, over five years, the whole deal,
it still makes sense for you.
Because it works out to a $15 million loan
at something like 6.5%.
So it's a little higher.
But it is still something that is worth doing for you.
Well, unless I want to get out of it early.
Right, unless you want to get out of it early.
Because now it sucks for you, the bank.
Because you've got to buy back these warrants,
or the preferred stock that I got from them.
So this is why Douglas Leach at Sentra Bank
decided basically, look, government,
you know, we only had this money for a matter of weeks.
Now it looks like the terms of the deal
might be changing, and we want out.
And here's how we think we should handle the warrants.
We're going to buy them back from you.
But we're not going to give you $750,000 for them.
You only spent $750 for them.
So that's what will give you back $750.
Two days later, the lady that runs our wire transfer
department came into me and said,
Doug, we got a wire back from Treasury for $750.
Simultaneously, my assistant delivered to me
a letter from Treasury indicating
that in order for us to exit the TARP program,
the pathway was to wire $750,000 plus interest.
So not $750, $750,000.
Even though the bank had only held the money for six weeks,
Sentra had to pay the equivalent
of a 60% annual interest rate on it.
Ouch.
If Sentra had stayed in TARP longer,
that loan would have actually been pretty cheap.
But exiting early came with a real penalty.
And in his case, Leach says, TARP backfired.
It was supposed to give banks extra capital,
but Sentra lost $750,000.
This happened two weeks ago, and Douglas Leach
has been to Washington.
He talked to West Virginia lawmakers,
including Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito.
Capito says she's not sure what should be done,
but certainly what happened to Sentra Bank feels unfair.
And I think we need to look at it
to make sure that we don't penalize people
who are trying to do the right thing,
pay the TARP money back, and in a lot of cases,
our local lenders who are very healthy.
Sentra was the first bank to fully pull out of TARP,
but Douglas Leach says other banks' CEOs
have been calling him, also wanting out.
So it sounds like this is just not something
that people anticipated, that no one thought
that the banks might want to get out of TARP early?
I think these contracts were written up by people
who, frankly, had not gotten a lot of sleep.
I mean, remember, the country was in total crisis,
and they were trying to do a fair job
and trying to protect the taxpayer.
Douglas Leach, he says,
he doesn't actually blame Treasury or lawmakers.
He says he sees this as kind of a glitch.
I mean, it is worth pointing out
that it's probably not gonna be so expensive
for some other banks to get out,
because Sentra is a private bank,
and so those warrants are basically
for a fixed amount of money, preferred shares.
But for a publicly traded bank,
the warrants actually allow the government
to buy regular old stock in the bank.
And right now, those bank stocks
have mostly gone down, right?
So the warrants, they're worth a lot less.
They're what people call underwater.
And so it's gonna be a little less painful
for those publicly traded banks
to buy them back from Treasury and get out of TARP.
So, David, we've been talking about small banks
who took TARP money, baby TARPs,
they're sometimes called.
But of course, the bulk of the money
went to a small number of really big banks,
mama TARPs.
Mama TARPs, and the mama TARPs,
they're also saying,
hey, we would like to get out of TARP,
but there's a different catch here for them,
which is that the government
may not want them to give the money back.
Right, it's like the hospital patient
who's saying, I'm fine, I'm fine,
I wanna go home, let me outta here.
And the government regulator is saying,
whoa, lie back down,
we're not sure you're out of the woods yet.
Yeah, or like, maybe we're convinced
you're gonna live, but the economy's still sick,
and sorry, bank, it depends on you.
So this actually came up at a recent hearing
by the Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP.
Representative Jeb Henserling of Texas
asked Tim Geithner, our Treasury Secretary,
about a Wall Street Journal article
in which Geithner indicated that
the health of the banks was not gonna be
the only factor that determines whether
they'll be able to be allowed
to repay the bailout money.
Here's what Geithner said.
Ultimately, though, we have to look at two things.
One is, do the institutions themselves
have enough capital to be able to lend,
and does the system as a whole,
is it working for the American people for recovery?
And that's the standard we're gonna look at.
But of course, nothing would make me happier
than for that resource to come in.
My time is limited at the moment,
but just to understand then,
there will be other considerations
besides the individual institution's
financial stability.
I'm a little confused on what-
Well, I'm not sure I would say it right there, Wayne.
As I said, this is a judgment that I don't make.
It's a judgment that the federal banking agencies make
under the conditions that were established
in the Recovery Act.
And they're in the process now,
the Fed and our agency are in the process
of working through how to make these judgments.
But again, the critical thing we care about
is whether the system as a whole
is in a position where it has the capacity
to support the credit the recovery requires.
That's the ultimate test.
That's our treasury secretary, Tim Geithner.
Hey, Hannah, I don't know how often this happens to you,
but I get questions from people on these topics
that I have been covering,
and I just, I don't know the answer.
I mean, they sort of seem simple,
and I feel like I should know the answer right away,
but I don't.
That's funny, David.
That actually never happens to me.
Okay, so like for instance,
what are you talking about?
Well, the other day someone asked us
about the stress tests that the Treasury Department
is conducting on the banks to see how healthy they are.
And Laura Conaway here was the lucky party
getting the question.
Right, you're talking about those stress tests
that we are expecting results
on the country's 19 biggest banks on Thursday.
Right, and what the person wanted to know
has to do with toxic assets,
the stuff that's on the bank's balance sheets
that nobody wants to buy
so no one can say for sure what they're worth.
And if no one knows,
how can anyone run a proper stress test?
So say you have a toxic asset,
the bank says it's worth 50 cents
and the market says it's worth 25 cents.
How are you supposed to value what it's worth
in some dark, uncertain future?
Right, so it sounded like
some kind of awful circular logic.
So Laura called up Douglas Elliott
and he tracks banking for the Brookings Institution
in Washington, D.C.
The stress tests are going to require judgments
to be made about the value of these assets
that are hard to value.
So it's a somewhat subjective call.
You gather as much information as you can
and you form a judgment.
I mean, anybody who asked to value this
would go through the same process
with as much information as they could get.
In this case, the regulators
will have a ton of information
and hopefully they'll make a reasonable judgment.
But there's still a range
within which they could easily fall.
Elliott says that folks from the treasury
used a mix of techniques to put a price on the loans.
So for you super nerds out there,
that means a little market to market,
a little mark to model
with a lean toward mark to model.
Douglas Elliott also said this other thing,
which is that while we're all so obsessed
with toxic assets,
that's probably not the central place
you need to be looking right now
because he says that two thirds of the bank's losses
are probably going to come
from ordinary loans to businesses.
Right, which is the bread and butter,
the loans in the banking system.
And you know, you might have heard
that we're in a big whopper of a recession
and in a recession, all sorts of loans go unpaid.
The big categories that are the coming losses
are commercial industrial loans,
which is just the general category
of most business loans
and commercial real estate loans.
So for instance, the IMF estimates
have gone from a few percent losses
in these categories
to I think they're at 7% now,
maybe heading towards 10%.
So there's something we can all look forward to.
Hannah, let's get back
to our planning money indicator, 87%, right?
That is the amount a clown named Mandy Dalton
says her work was down from January to April.
So Mandy's been a professional clown for 27 years.
It's been her main source of income
for most of that time.
But lately she is starting to look around
for other opportunities
because one, business hasn't been good
and two, it's really physically rigorous,
demanding career with all the juggling
and the walking on stilts
and the slipping on banana peels.
So Mandy told the Planet Money's Caitlin Kenny
business this year is the worst she has ever seen it.
Look, we used to have an old saying
which is the best argument against,
there are three great arguments
against being a full-time entertainer
and that is January, February, and March.
It's our down season naturally anyway.
But this was unreal.
This was no movement.
I had friends, I myself received no calls,
no gigs in February.
I had friends who received no calls in February.
People who've been doing this for a long time
have really established reputations and such.
We just saw nothing.
And then all of a sudden today,
just as things are picking up
and I started seeing like some gigs coming in,
April was looking okay,
but May was starting to actually look like
kind of a normal May.
All of a sudden, I'm getting calls today saying,
well, we're not sure yet,
but we think we might be canceling
because we're not sure what's gonna happen
with the swine flu thing.
And this is a public event.
I understand it, but then another part of me is like,
well, you know, what I've been hearing
about the whole swine flu thing is that
the regular flu ends up killing more people
than it's been infected worldwide just in the U.S.
And so once again,
I'm seeing like the economy's already bad
and now public officials are ramping up
their preventative measures on this thing,
but I'm not sure that that's really helping.
So Mandy says these are the kind of events,
you know, mainly municipalities
and quasi-governmental organizations usually throw
with, you know, big events
where people are wondering
whether or not they should have a large group of people
in one small area.
And since she works in D.C., Baltimore,
these events are really the bulk of her work.
This is just one of those examples
of how interconnected the economy is, right?
We have a global pandemic
that's hurting a small-time entertainer.
And there's this other part to her story,
which is that Mandy has another economic problem.
She has a client who can't afford to pay her back
and the client is someone we've talked about
on Planet Money, general growth properties.
Aha, so David, you did a whole story on them, right?
Yeah, the general growth properties,
the second largest mall owner in the United States.
They filed for bankruptcy protection
because they had billions of dollars of loans
that came due they could not refinance.
So Mandy, it turns out,
did a performance for general growth properties
at a family fun day
at one of the shopping malls in the Baltimore area.
And she recently got a phone call
from one of the people who arranged it,
saying she probably isn't gonna see the money for it.
I can just jump in with the other creditors.
And when we're talking about something
like general growth properties,
the creditors meeting for the bankruptcy
is gonna be in New York City.
And I, well, you know, frankly,
I only charged him $200 for the gig.
I have to wait.
Do I want to spend the money that it's gonna take me
to go up to New York for an overnight
to sit in on the creditors meeting
where other people are gonna be there for,
you know, if not millions,
certainly in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
looking for payment from them.
And I'm supposed to go to the judge
in charge of the bankruptcy and say,
I want my $200,
and I'm gonna get pennies on the dollar.
I mean, you can understand it's not,
it's not the kind of thing
that I'm jumping up and down
about getting out there to do.
I mean, I could still do it out of print.
I have some friends I've talked to about this
who, you know, a magician friend of mine, definitely,
he's in the, oh, whatever it takes, however much,
even if you go in the hole on it,
you should go up there and make us out of principle.
And I'm looking at it going,
I wish I could,
but the future is also not looking so great.
And maybe I want to save that money that,
you know, and just kind of keep to say it,
let them off the hook.
And so Mandy says, by the way,
if you're thinking $200 is a lot for a clown show,
she says, actually, when you factor in
the time getting to gigs and prepping for them,
it works out to something more like,
she's getting paid something like $15 an hour.
That is without expenses,
things like costumes and props that really aren't cheap.
Clown shoes, man, clown shoes, they're expensive.
Clown shoes will run you about 200, 300 bucks a pair,
easy.
Wow, because they're so big and floppy?
Yeah, well, mine aren't as big and floppy.
Mine are a little pretty and dainty.
I don't go for the big floppy thing as much as I used to.
I used to have the big water ski type clown shoes.
Why are they so expensive?
Well, they had, most of the time they're custom made.
Oh, gotcha.
You know, people don't have a big,
the people who make shoes like this,
they don't have a big inventory,
a big feet that they can fit.
So they try to keep their inventory low
and they just make them one at a time per order.
It's pretty expensive.
The makeup, the makeup's not too bad
as far as expensive goes,
but I do a lot of face painting,
so I go through a lot more makeup than most people.
Oh, there's another expense, liability insurance.
Clowns have to carry liability insurance.
Really?
Yeah, yep.
If you're like me, you've been doing it for so long
and you're doing these gigs out in the community
and you're doing them for shopping malls
and shopping centers and public squares
and stuff like that, they have liability requirements.
It's not like they'll just take anybody.
They want to know that you're covered
at least for a million dollars
if they get hit with something.
So yeah, clowns have to carry liability insurance.
So do magicians, so do jugglers.
How much does that?
Nearly everybody who does this kind of thing.
How much does that cost to you?
That, luckily because of the group I belong to,
it's relatively inexpensive.
It's for the entire year.
You know, a million dollar insurance policy
costs around 215 bucks for the entire year
and it covers me for like, you know,
like if I'm juggling and for some reason
a ball strays and hits somebody on the head.
You know, God forbid that should happen.
I'm a lot better than that, really.
But God forbid something like that should happen.
I am covered for it.
So not only is Mandy hurting,
but that also means that the clown shoe manufacturer
is hurting and the clown insurer
and the makeup manufacturer
and I'm sure many, many more people.
I feel like this is gonna be your fallout
to the economics of pirates.
Okay, for now I think we're out.
Devin Dwyer's got a great Planet Money video

It's hard finding a job.
It's also hard finding a volunteer gig.

and a weird thing for non-profits.
