At issue: whether the latter misled the former into selling insurance way too cheaply. Securities lawyer Zachary Rosenbaum decodes the briefs. Plus: Listener Renee Rico responds to the Elizabeth Warren interview.

ELIZABETH WARREN: I actually had to eat a slice of pizza, or I was going to pass out. I needed something. So...

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Sure.

WARREN: So I went ahead and ate something.

DAVIDSON: OK. Great. And, Chana, some level from you.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

We also had a very rushed lunch, and we walked back. And there was a line of police cars out front, which I had never seen before, which Adam tells me is a regular occurrence.

WARREN: Limos.

JOFFE-WALT: That's them...

DAVIDSON: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Showing off, too, maybe.

WARREN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: I think so. Or it could be the last of the assets of the - you know.

DAVIDSON: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

WARREN: You know, they pulled them all in to have a big auction.

DAVIDSON: I'm rolling. Yes. OK. Great. So we're good to go.

JOFFE-WALT: Good.

DAVIDSON: Excellent. All right. So, Elizabeth Warren, what's the exact chair?

WARREN: Yeah. I'm chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel that oversees how the TARP money...

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: ...Gets spent.

DAVIDSON: And let's start 'cause this - actually, this week is a bit on point. What is the job of the COP?

WARREN: Right. So...

DAVIDSON: Do you call it COP?

WARREN: Yeah, I do.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: That's fair. Or the panel or, you know, oh, my gosh, that thing again.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: You know, it's all of those things to me. So think about how Congress set this thing up. Secretary Paulson goes to Congress and says, I need money by - immediately or else the economy is going to collapse, and I need $700 billion. And he wanted it on a kind of a, you know, no-strings-attached basis. And Congress said, now, wait a minute. We can't quite do it that way. So they put in some, you know, to help the economy and families and foreclosures and that sort of thing.

DAVIDSON: They put some limitations. He couldn't...

WARREN: Well...

DAVIDSON: ...Just spend 700 billion however he wants.

WARREN: They kind of put some hints, OK? But...

DAVIDSON: Not actual limitations.

WARREN: That's not...

DAVIDSON: Nothing with teeth...

WARREN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Is what you're saying.

WARREN: Well, but what he did is they set the structure up. They said, we're going to give you the money, and we're not going to put a lot of strings on it. Look; let's be fair. You don't tell a fireman, you know, we're going to give you water to try to put out the fire, but you got to put so much on this side, and you got to aim it over there, and you got to aim it this way and put so much pressure. So they did leave a lot of discretion, which is what you do with someone in an emergency. And they said, but we're going to create this other thing, this oversight panel, and they're going to have to produce reports every month to talk about what you're up to and how it works and how it's structured, and is it headed in the right direction?

So basically, they created this kind of back-and-forth process. Treasury does something, and we do something. And Treasury does something, and we do something. And that's how the money ultimately works its way on into the economy.

JOFFE-WALT: How was that communicated to you? Like, when you got the call, what did they say we want you to do?

DAVIDSON: And who called you? Harry Reid?

WARREN: Yeah, it was Senator Reid. I - actually, I think I - maybe I'd shaken hands with him once at, you know, some function or something. But I really hadn't met him. And I was at home, and I was having a barbecue for my law students - my first-year law students. And so, you know, the doorbell is ringing. And here's the guy from Redbones with, you know, a zillion pounds of coleslaw and ribs and stuff. And the dog is running around going crazy because the stuff smells really good, and the phone's ringing. And this person on the other end says, this is Harry Reid. And I'm thinking, who's Harry Reid? And just for a second...

DAVIDSON: He's the Senate majority leader.

(LAUGHTER)

WARREN: That's right. Thank you.

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: I've figure that out since then. In fact, I think I probably shouldn't have just said that.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

WARREN: But - so he says, I want you to be the head of this congressional oversight panel. When we got the money, we decided we wanted to set up an independent panel on the outside to watch what's going on, you know, ask tough questions, do what needs to be done. And I said, me? You know, because I'm - look; I'm outside that political process. I'm not in that. And he said, yeah, you. And he said, and somebody who brings your interest in families and focus on economics and your background in bankruptcy. He said, you're going to be great at this, and we want you to do it. And...

JOFFE-WALT: But what was it? Like, what did he say? You're...

WARREN: Oversee. And, you know, read the statute. He said, we'll send you the statute. And it is.

DAVIDSON: I think...

WARREN: It's very short.

DAVIDSON: ...The reason this is relevant today is two of your - three of your committee members have said - and we don't have to go too far down this road. But...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Three of your committee members have said that this report extends beyond the core job of the Congressional Oversight Panel. And so - I'm just trying to open this up here. I'm trying to get the exact - well, I guess Hensarling just said I don't support it. He didn't say why.

WARREN: Right. He doesn't support it and - sorry about the...

DAVIDSON: Right, but he didn't say why. He just said I don't...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: I'm not into it.

WARREN: And the other four people voted in favor of it. So I'm not - you actually have me at a disadvantage here. I don't know what the - what folks are saying. But we have four people who voted for it and one guy who didn't vote for it. And the guy who didn't vote for it hadn't voted for all of the reports except one. He just never votes for it.

DAVIDSON: Can I tell you what I want to do?

WARREN: Sure.

DAVIDSON: This is - I'm from New York. My mom's Israeli. I like to - I get afraid of how blunt I can be sometimes.

WARREN: That's OK.

DAVIDSON: And I feel like I have a love affair-hate affair with the Congressional Oversight Panel...

WARREN: OK. OK.

DAVIDSON: ...Personally. I feel like I want to say all the things that I've said behind your back.

WARREN: OK. All right. I'm ready.

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: I'm ready.

DAVIDSON: All right.

WARREN: I'm here. OK.

DAVIDSON: And I want to say this with - you know, in a polite, friendly way.

WARREN: That's OK.

DAVIDSON: So No. 1 thing is - and this isn't you. This would be talking to Harry Reid. The - in a way, we're doing the same job. I mean, there's a lot of things that you spend your day doing that we're spending our days doing that are exactly the same. I think we can certainly agree that the - both the current administration's Treasury Department and the prior administration's Treasury Department, shall we say, has not been completely successful in communicating to the world and to us individually what their plan is, what their goals are, how we can assess their success or failure. And I think we share tremendous frustration. I think I can say that, even as an objective journalist, that this is very frustrating. I've said that publicly many times, and that I think we both agree that it's essential for - I mean, forget about the TARP. It's essential for democracy. This is a crucial moment. We are massively changing the rules of the game - you know, some of the core bedrock assumptions of how capitalism works. And this is an essential moment for clarity and transparency. And I feel like that's something I demand. I think you have very publicly demanded it. And so there's a lot of love affair here. So, you know, the - kind of we're doing the same job. We're fighting the same fight. And it's a really, really hard fight.

WARREN: Yes.

DAVIDSON: And I'm guessing that the three people in this room, if you had asked us a year ago or two years ago to explain the waterfall payment structure of a collateralized debt obligation, I mean...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...It's both - it's technically really complicated. And it's politically complicated and on a...

WARREN: And it's momentous.

DAVIDSON: And it's momentous. And it feels - probably for us more than the average person in America. The average person in America has a - probably, I'm guessing, a kind of vague, inchoate, something big is happening. Maybe I'm getting screwed. I don't know. But I don't like it, right? And we're actually facing it. And then sometimes I say to people, man, if you knew what I knew, you'd be a lot madder than you are now.

OK. So first off, what frustrates me about this panel is the organization because I look at Jeb Hensarling, who is - who's a very ideological-based - you know, he's not someone I would go to for a nuanced, subtle view of an economic issue. But I look at you as an advocate of a very specific area of concern having to do with bankruptcy, credit card protection, home foreclosure - that area - but not a I'm - you know, I'm just an objective observer. You have a view. You have a point of view. And we've actually had some great talks on this podcast with Damian (ph) Silvers, right?

WARREN: Mmm hmm.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: Damon.

DAVIDSON: Damon Silver (ph). Right. I knew I was missing - and a smart guy, engaged guy. But, you know, clearly from an advocate point of view of - you know, I mean he's counsel for AFL-CIO. Clearly, they're not a - and, you know, for me as a reporter, what I try to do is talk to experts who are not advocate - they don't have an agenda - a specific sub-agenda. Their agenda is just, is this stupid? Is this smart? Is this good? Is this bad? And I don't look at your panel and see that. And it makes me - on an optics level.

WARREN: So I got to tell you, I just think you're wrong. OK? So we can do our love affair-hate affair here.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: But I just think you're wrong on this. I mean, let's start with this. I get about people who have agendas in the sense that they work in an industry. They get paid. You know, my agenda is I spent 30 years doing research. I was a registered Republican, if we want to just start there. I'm somebody who believes in free markets. I'm somebody who's trained in all of this. And I have exactly one job and that is the job to do as much research as I can, to work as hard as I can and then to tell what I believe is the truth. Now, where that ultimately has put me - and it took me a long time to get here - is that the American middle class is under assault. They are getting the wrong end of a great, big financial deal overall. This is a generational shift.

DAVIDSON: You're not talking about...

WARREN: I'm not talking about TARP.

DAVIDSON: ...Specifically TARP or TALF or...

WARREN: I'm not talking about anything else. I'm talking about how this economy has shifted. I'm talking about...

DAVIDSON: Through - since the '70s is what you're saying.

WARREN: That's right. Basically...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: ...Since the '70s, that we have undergone a profound shift in America. And it's a shift that has not been supportive to the middle class. That's what I think the research says. Look; there are people who disagree with me. There are people who agree with me, and there are people who don't think about what I say. But that isn't - I'm not an advocate. I don't get paid for anything. And I don't - what I do is I'm an empiricist. I'm data driven. I change my mind on a lot of things. You show me numbers. And by golly, you know, this may be shocking, but I'll sit down and shut up if you've got the right set of numbers. I go out and collect original data and try to analyze it. I put it out there for other researchers to be able to deal with.

So I think the notion that that somehow makes me an advocate - you know, to me, an advocate is a lobbyist. You know, I'm not a guy who does it. I'm not somebody who works for Goldman Sachs. I'm not somebody who works for one of the big banks. I'm not even somebody who works for one of the consumer groups where somebody else has to decide what your agenda is. I'm driven by my work and, ultimately, what I think that work says. And look; that work will change over time 'cause - let me tell you where there's a big difference.

I got asked a few years back on a - you know, there was a debate. And they wanted me to appear on a radio show or a talk show or something. And I said, so who are you going to get on the other side? And they named a bank lobbyist. And I said, look; let me just point out the difference to you. If the bank lobbyist says, hey, up is down, and in is out, and, you know, the moon rises in the morning, he goes on to his next job. And he said, ha ha, you know, it doesn't matter. I can say anything, and this shows you why I'm valuable as a lobbyist 'cause I can take any position and sound persuasive and credible. I live with what I've said for the rest of my life. And if I get it wrong, then I have to live with that.

So I try to be careful about what I say. I try to be data driven about what I say. But don't put me in the stack of the lobbyists and people who get paid to take a point of view 'cause I could be wrong, but if I'm wrong, it's because I just - I couldn't get the pieces together right. I'm not wrong 'cause I got paid for taking a point of view.

DAVIDSON: And I think that's a very solid point, which I - and I hadn't thought about it in that specific way. And I - you know, we as reporters, we're constantly interviewing people where you're like - so I could say anything, and you'd just say that talking point.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: And it is maddening, which is one of the reasons why we try and have academics. I remember one of my favorite professors when I was in college said, the one thing you know as an academic is you're always wrong about almost everything you say, but you are working in a system that will find that out through truth seeking, and you're approaching the truth asymptotically.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: Something like that.

WARREN: No, it's - and look; I have written things from years ago I wish I could take back. You know, some of my early academic research, I just - I didn't have my arms around it...

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: ...Right. I didn't have the right insights. And 20 years from now, I may say, this is - actually, it's funny. I will bring it to this moment. This is what haunts me right now. I wake up at 3 in the morning almost every morning, and I think, what am I missing? What is it that I'm going to discover a year from today, five years from today, 10 years from today that I should have asked Treasury for? What document should I have looked for? What line of inquiry should I have pursued, and I missed it? That's...

DAVIDSON: And...

WARREN: ...The terror of it.

DAVIDSON: ...I will say - I mean, I don't know you. This is my first time meeting you. But it's certainly the impression one gets from you that you are a voracious truth seeker. That - and - but I think my point - and again, it's not fair to even bring it to you. But you're sitting here. Harry Reid isn't. I think you are well known as - at least in the public perception, as someone whose work points to a conclusion that banks and credit card companies are giving a raw deal to consumers. I think it would be not terribly hard to find a lot of people who would agree with you. But that you are - that your work is in opposition to the banks.

I guess what I'm saying is the panel is structured - it seems to me it was like, OK, we're going to have three lefties and two righties. And that doesn't speak to the seriousness of this moment. Like, I feel like I wanted a panel that didn't - that wasn't so clearly - like, if you were on a different panel where there were five academics, I might feel differently about it.

WARREN: Well...

DAVIDSON: I mean, you know what I mean?

WARREN: Fair enough. Look; would I rather be on a panel with five academics? I like academics, right? I'm used to this kind of - we have our own way of going hammer and tongs about things, and I think that's a good thing. But if you don't have somebody who cares about American families, then they don't have a seat at the table in this debate. I'm going to actually push back on this point because I think this point is really important.

I think what we have here is we have a little, tight, insider world who understands exactly what synthetic derivatives are and how the mortgage-backed security market works and would like nothing better than to say, you know, this is too hard for everybody else. You guys don't worry yourselves about it. We'll just go into a room, and we'll tell you how much you should write a check for, and we'll pass it out among ourselves in the ways that are appropriate, and we'll write a set of rules going forward that really works for us. And I think that when those folks get taxpayer money - which they've obviously got lots and lots of - the taxpayers, ordinary families, middle-class families, working people, should now have a seat at the table. They should be a part...

DAVIDSON: And that's you.

WARREN: ...Of the discussion. And I think that's part of my obligation is to bring that. And I don't think I'm the only one. I encourage the panel to come in that direction. But look; it's five people. I don't get to write these reports by myself. If we don't have three votes, we don't have a report at the end of the day. So I got to spend a lot of time talking with other people on the panel - people who have very different backgrounds from my background, people who are not as excited about this range of issues.

But I'll say at least how I see it, and that's all I can do. I can just give you an honest broker's point of view on this, and that is my job in this world is to make sure that when these enormous, profound economic decisions are being made - because that is where we are today - that the American family is there. They are part of that process because if they are part of the process, the rules that get made, the decisions that get made will be different. So...

DAVIDSON: But that...

WARREN: ...I take this as the acknowledgement of how important this is. We can't leave the American family behind by saying, let's get five neutral people who really don't know anything and don't care a whole lot, but they know what a synthetic derivative is. Not good enough.

DAVIDSON: Right. Well, not who don't know anything but who...

WARREN: Who what? Who are indifferent to what's happened to the American family over the last 30 years? Who are totally uninformed about what's happened to incomes and savings and debt and wages? I mean, I just - who don't know what? What kind of person do you want in there? Someone who says, hey, maybe we're all doing great; maybe we're not doing great? That's just not evidence based.

DAVIDSON: No. Someone who says that our assignment here - we are not the Congressional Oversight Panel of the American family. We're not the Congressional Oversight Panel of 30 years of the American economy. We're the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and its Troubled Asset Relief Program. That's our job. This is a technical project. And our job is to look at it technically and see if it's technically doing the job right.

WARREN: No, this is a policy-based undertaking. There is an inspector general whose job - he's called the special inspector general of the TARP, right?

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: And he's the SIGTARP.

DAVIDSON: We've talked to him. He's great.

WARREN: Right. And he...

DAVIDSON: Yes, SIGTARP. Yep.

WARREN: And he really is terrific. But he has a very specific job. Were laws broken? Have we technically followed the rules? That's Neil Barofsky's job. And good for him. And I - as far as I know, he's good at executing on this. And he's out there with a whole team of forensic accountants, and they're checking that out. Our job is different. Our job is to stand on the outside. And every time Treasury says, you know, here's how we're going to organize it, here's the move we're going to make, here's the direction we're going to go, our job is to stand there and say, why are you doing it that way? Is there a better way to do it? Have you done it with adequate transparency? Are you really asking for any accountability?

DAVIDSON: But that's not what you're saying.

WARREN: Yes, it is.

DAVIDSON: But what you're - I mean, what you're just saying now is - what I thought you were about to say, based on what you were saying earlier, is our job is to stand there and say, don't just think about the banks. Think about the American worker. Think about the 1980s, the...

WARREN: Read the statute. That's what the statute tells us to do. The statute specifically says, come on, we were not empowered to say, Elizabeth Warren, please - and Congressional Oversight Panel, please watch out just in this little square box to make sure the banks survive. No. I'm sorry. Go read our enabling statute. Our enabling statute is about what's happening to the American taxpayer, whether they're getting a fair deal, what's happening in mortgage foreclosures. We are taken directly into the question - the $700 billion is to save the American economy, not simply to save a handful of big banks. That was - that's not what the statute says. What the statute says is it's there to help all of us. And so our job is to ask, is it helping all of us, not just the biggest financial institution?

DAVIDSON: OK. So this is - I found - so one of your members, Jeb Hensarling, Republican congressman, just - he just said, I don't vote for this. He didn't give any reasons. He just said I'm not - I don't like it. Right? And he's done that for all of the reports or...

WARREN: I think there was one he voted in favor of.

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: But I'd actually have to check my records.

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: I'm pretty sure he's voted against six reports.

DAVIDSON: OK. So Richard Neiman, who we know here in New York, is New York state supervisor of banking, (inaudible) banking.

WARREN: Yeah. He's the banking regulator for New York.

DAVIDSON: Banking regulator for New York. Good guy. I know him well. Well is strong, but I know him. John Sununu, Republican from New Hampshire, and...

WARREN: Former senator.

DAVIDSON: Former senator. So their view was Neiman voted for the report but with reservations. Sununu voted...

WARREN: No, Sununu voted for the report, too.

DAVIDSON: Oh, for the report but with reservations. So here's the reservations.

WARREN: Are we talking about the May report? They just voted.

DAVIDSON: This is the April.

WARREN: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm one report off from you.

DAVIDSON: I'm sorry. OK. Gotcha.

WARREN: We just voted. We literally just voted about...

DAVIDSON: Oh, OK.

WARREN: ...Two hours ago. And I'm...

DAVIDSON: Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. OK.

WARREN: So I'm thinking, hmm.

DAVIDSON: No, I'm not that in the know.

WARREN: OK. Sorry. Sorry.

DAVIDSON: OK. So that report - the April report, I'm sorry.

WARREN: The April report.

DAVIDSON: The last report that I have access to...

WARREN: Fair enough. Fair enough.

DAVIDSON: ...Says the primary mission of the panel is to evaluate the effectiveness of Treasury's actions, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It is not our role to design or approve Treasury strategy, nor should the panel's mission be expanded to encroach on that authority. You don't agree with that sentence, do you?

WARREN: Well, I'm not quite sure what that sentence means. Let me just remind you what the April report said, OK, so we're - at least now that we're on the same page...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: ...Because I thought we were on a different report. The April report had nothing - it was not a discussion of consumers or consumer credit, let's just be clear here. The April report looked at how other financial crises have been handled in other parts of the world and at other points in time. So for example, we had a hearing, and we looked at - we had the person in from Sweden who handled the meltdown of the Swedish banks. We had a specialist on Japanese economy who talked to us about the lost decade in Japan. We had a specialist from the RTC who talked about here in the United States what happened the last time we had a major...

DAVIDSON: With the S and L.

WARREN: ...Banking crisis with the savings and loans. And we had a specialist on the Depression. We also...

DAVIDSON: And someone on Continental Illinois.

WARREN: That's right. We talked about Continental Illinois. And so we wrote a report that said there are three basic tools. It's possible - when you've got a financial system that's in crisis, that's under pressure, there are really three things we can do. We can liquidate it, right? That's what we did with the RTC. We can reorganize it in place. That's kind of what Sweden did. It's what we did with Continental Illinois. Or we can subsidize it. And right now we have taken the route of subsidization.

DAVIDSON: Which, by the way, for people who visit the presentation Alex Blumberg and I gave, this is pretty much exactly what we said.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: We actually called it a bastardized half-measure between other options, what we've done now. It's sort of not any one of the pure options. It's a mix of options.

WARREN: There's a little mix. But you're right - but dominant, right?

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: Trying to describe three buckets here - those would be...

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: ...I think we agree.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah.

WARREN: Those are the three buckets.

DAVIDSON: Oh, no question. Yeah.

WARREN: So this report talks about the three buckets. It talks about what the experiences were. Japan followed this subsidization route and didn't try reorganization in place, didn't try liquidation of their financial institutions.

DAVIDSON: How did that work out?

WARREN: And they ended up - well, and they ended up in economic hell for 14 years. And so we kind of go through, see what we can distill out of that. And we said, you know, what really comes out of this is the importance of transparency. When you try to hide how the books are, as the Japanese did, you end up with nobody trusting them. Everyone pretends that everything's OK, but, in fact, no lending gets restarted. You really don't have a strong base. We talk about accountability, that other times, other places when you hold the leaders of the financial institutions accountable for the mistakes that these institutions have made, when you hold the institutions themselves accountable, that has a really profound influence on what happens. And when the government has a really clear position - when they articulate what they're doing, say this is the plan, this is how we're going to execute it. This is how we're going to steer through it.

DAVIDSON: And I will say that everything you just said is - I would say my theoretical panel of nonpartisan academics. I mean, almost every economist we talked to ticks off almost - pretty much every one of those. That is pretty mainstream view.

WARREN: Yeah, no. That's exactly right.

DAVIDSON: Now, whether there will be people who advocate different ways, different types of plan, but I think...

WARREN: Nuance, shadings - you bet. You bet.

DAVIDSON: But transparency, speed, fairness...

WARREN: Transparency, accountability, right?

DAVIDSON: ...Accountability - right, right - fairness.

WARREN: Accountability, I think, is really big in this and clarity.

DAVIDSON: And clarity, yeah.

WARREN: I think that's absolutely right in describing this. So that is the report. I've just given you the April report. But the difference here...

DAVIDSON: But don't you come out effective? I mean, basically, you can't read that report without saying - thinking we should nationalize the banks.

WARREN: Well.

DAVIDSON: That's clearly the choice we should make.

WARREN: That's - the report does not say we should nationalize anybody. What the report says is these are the options. And we don't have three votes for a position that says here's something we should do. And so the report does not say that. I just want to be clear. Some people think you shouldn't even say it. Some people think you shouldn't even talk about the fact that there are three tools in the toolbox - liquidation, reorganization and subsidization. Some people don't like calling giving money to banks subsidization. They like - Henry Paulson liked calling it investment...

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: ...Investment opportunities.

DAVIDSON: I prefer transfer. I think that's a clearer way of explaining it.

WARREN: Fair enough. Fair enough. But the point is, there are people who don't like that clear, flat language. There are people who think we shouldn't be talking about these issues. And I understand that. They're entitled to say that.

DAVIDSON: But - OK, I want to get back - all right. So I don't want to talk about stuff you and I agree on - that's not fun.

WARREN: OK, OK.

DAVIDSON: ...Which is a lot. There's no question. And I would love, if you get a minute or one of your staff to watch our presentation, 'cause I think it's basically - you know, maybe there's more jokes - but it's pretty similar to your report. But - OK, so I was talking earlier more about the optics of it. I mean, it just felt like Senate Democrats were saying, we're not going to see this. I remember when - that dramatic week when I think - around when Paulson presented his three-page document, and then Congress said, come on, you can't do that. We need something more substantive. A friend of - me saying to my friend, well, here comes the partisanship. My friend said, no way, they're going to rise above partisanship. And it just feels like they didn't rise above partisanship in many, many ways. And so that was literally my entire - like, it's not a criticism of you. It's a criticism of Harry Reid. Why - I mean, you're the person I - you and Richard Neiman make the most sense on that panel. I don't actually understand why any of the other people are on that panel.

WARREN: But Richard Neiman and I don't agree with each other much of the time.

DAVIDSON: No, no, I'm fine with that.

WARREN: And...

DAVIDSON: But Richard Neiman has a...

WARREN: ...So I'm not sure why that makes it then political.

DAVIDSON: No, no. Right. So I'm saying you're a lifelong academic - you know, analyst of banking policy on working families, I guess. Is that a way to describe you?

WARREN: Right, right. But I'm also a - just to be clearer, I'm a lifelong studier of failure and rebirth. I mean, that's what I do. I teach...

DAVIDSON: Bankruptcy. Right.

WARREN: ...Chapter 11. I teach bankruptcy. I teach transnational failure and coming back, how institutions go into crisis and come out of it on the other side.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: That's what I do for a living.

DAVIDSON: But when you say - so - OK, so you make total sense. Richard Neiman, who was a latecomer, I guess, to the panel, he...

WARREN: No, no. He was appointed...

DAVIDSON: He was one of the first?

WARREN: Yeah, he was appointed, I think...

DAVIDSON: Oh, OK. All right.

WARREN: ...About the same time I was. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: But Richard Neiman - lifelong regulator, I think well respected.

WARREN: Yeah, so he's been in it from a regulatory...

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I mean, you see...

WARREN: ...Perspective.

DAVIDSON: ...Why - OK, so I see why you're on the panel. I see why he's on the panel. I don't see why the general counsel of the AFL-CIO and two partisan Republicans are on the panel. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

WARREN: So we can talk about Damon Silvers. But here's what I'd say about Damon. What Damon...

DAVIDSON: Oh, by the way, let me just say what we've learned about Damon - 'cause we've actually gotten to know him a little bit - he happens to be someone who is incredibly curious, who has...

WARREN: Amazing.

DAVIDSON: ...Worked really, really hard to understand these issues.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: He's - he was talking to one of our colleagues about how he had just forced himself to understand the balance sheet. I think it - in particular depth, I think it was of Citibank, and he was running all sorts of experiments. But I don't think he was picked - I mean, I think when you say we're going to have - I mean, I just don't - like, it just seems clear to me. You look at this panel. You say advocate for working families - or not advocate - academic whose focus has been on the struggle of working families against large banks...

WARREN: Right, but also about the death and rebirth of...

DAVIDSON: And that's a rebirth - right.

WARREN: ...Large economic institutions, right?

DAVIDSON: And like I'm saying, like, you - like, I see you on that panel.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: General counsel of the AFL-CIO, of all the people I know - and I like Damon Silvers. I think he's smart. I think he's curious. He - I'm sorry, Damon - is not on my list of serious people in America who I would want on that panel.

WARREN: So let me tell you why he'd be on my list 'cause...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: ...He is on my list. And here's the reason he's on my list. He has both a law degree and an MBA. He is deeply schooled in how big corporations work because he has to be, 'cause that's his job. He plays back and forth on - remember what he does. He does labor and corporate policy. He spends all of his time worrying about kind of these policy concerns, how the big pieces move around. It matters, right? What matters to labor is not just a particular negotiation, but what's happening in the industries where they still exist. What industries are industries that may become part of the union movement? What should labor be doing? Will labor work in different patterns? So I find Damon a big thinker, and that's what I like about him. And he's a big thinker who was an outsider, though, to the particular game that's going on here. So I'll tell you how I divide this. I divide this as we had two outsiders, Damon and me. We both stood on the outside studying the system, and...

DAVIDSON: Outside to banking and to Congress.

WARREN: To banking and to Congress. And then we have someone who's a little more of an insider, someone who comes from a background of having been a banker and a regulator. And that's Richard.

DAVIDSON: Richard, yeah.

WARREN: He's on the inside. So I say - at least the three that were appointed by Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, and then jointly by Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi - that those three are three who study this. But none of them - we study it from the inside. We study it from the outside. And that's probably not a bad mix. I think that's not an unreasonable place to go.

DAVIDSON: All right, so my effort to get you to say on national radio that your panelists should not have been picked and you wish your other panelists were off it has failed...

WARREN: It has failed.

DAVIDSON: ...Although I didn't hear a spirited defense of the two Republican members.

WARREN: You'd have to ask the Republicans how that happened.

DAVIDSON: OK.

JOFFE-WALT: So I still don't quite get what the point of the - I mean, I don't mean this in a way - I don't get what the point of the panel is. Like, the inspector general I get. That's about, like, checking what's happening and what should be happening, what shouldn't be happening. The panel, it seems like - I don't understand what the role is that you're playing.

WARREN: Well, then, so let me give you an example. Maybe it's easier by specific example. OK? So Secretary Paulson gets the first $350 billion. And he immediately moves away from what he had originally announced, and that is there's going to be - we're going to buy toxic assets. Remember, that's how it got the name TARP, because it was going to be the toxic...

DAVIDSON: And this podcast was the first media outlet to break the story that he was going to - that he had the right to move away and that he might move away...

WARREN: OK. OK. So he moves away. And...

DAVIDSON: ...Which, by the way, most economists I know applauded. They liked that move away but...

WARREN: That's right. So he moves away, and he starts a program - let us remind ourselves - called the Healthy Banks Program. He says - he describes the problem, the economic problem in America, as a liquidity problem. He said the pipes are frozen. Remember how you use that analogy? And he said, so what we're going to do is we're going to put more money into these banks. These banks don't need it. They are financially healthy. We're going to put more money into these banks, and that will cause things to thaw, and there will be more lending, and when there's more lending, we can have more business activity, and the economy will right itself and be OK, all right?

So we do our December report, and we said we want to hear a little bit more about this exchange. And Secretary Paulson writes back - we want to know if the American taxpayer is getting a good deal, 'cause this is one of the statutory things we're supposed to ask. So Secretary Paulson writes back, and he said, well - he said, yes, they are. This is an investment. You may remember he kept using those words - no taxpayer is going to lose any money. We actually may make money on this. This is last October and November. He sends a letter back addressed to me, and he said these transactions - money into the banks for which the banks gave back preferred shares of stock and warrants. He said these transactions are good for the taxpayer. They occur - and here was the quote - "at or near par." So that just means for every $100 in, we're getting $100 at least on that day - $100 worth of stock.

DAVIDSON: Which - and I will just say, for those of us who cover the economy and for most experts I talked to, that was clearly ridiculous because - basically, if the government was going to pay par - in other words, if the government was going to pay the market price then there was no need for the government to do...

WARREN: No, that's not right. You're just wrong. If it's a liquidity issue - that is they are perfectly solvent, but they just literally don't have enough money to lend because people have stopped lending to them - then it's perfectly reasonable to take par in these transactions. It's just putting more cash in so they have more cash to lend out.

DAVIDSON: But par would have gone...

WARREN: Par is $100 in, $100 out. And that is exactly what Henry Paulson said he was doing. Now, we could have bowed politely, said thank you very much. But we decided that the appropriate thing to do was to check him on the numbers. So we got two academics who are specialists in how to look at valuations. And we hired an independent company that does nothing but sit around and value this kind of thing. And they crunched numbers. They went through different models. They basically developed three different valuation models, as you know. There's a little art as well as science in this.

Fortunately, all three models came to just about the same number. That gives you a lot of confidence you've got it right. And what they said on average is that in the first nine transactions - about $258 billion or so - they said for every $100 put in, the American taxpayer got back stock and warrants worth about $66. In other words, Paulson's description that this is entirely liquidity - he was putting it entirely into healthy banks - we came up with the numbers and said it did not happen. You subsidized these financial institutions. And you subsidized them and told us something very different.

DAVIDSON: But if it's at par - I just want to go back to the - the par value would mean the market neutral value. It's what they could - they would have gotten it from a Saudi prince or gotten it from Warren Buffett or something.

WARREN: Well, in fact, we checked that. In fact, there were three other very large transactions that took place roughly about this same time. One was Warren Buffett. One was Mitsubishi. And I'm just - Abu Dhabi was the third one.

DAVIDSON: The investment of...

WARREN: That's right. And the answer was on those, in fact, one was a little bit below par, and the other two were well above par. So the investments in the private market did occur for par - or better than par.

DAVIDSON: Can we - I want to get to some base level. Do you think that - between September of 2008 and now, that our banking system could have collapsed, that several of our major banks making up - depending on which ones - 40%, 60% and 90% of our banking system could have collapsed - that credit markets could have collapsed and that our economy could have come to a stall, like Bernanke and Paulson warned. Like...

WARREN: You mean if we hadn't done anything?

DAVIDSON: ...Yeah.

WARREN: I don't know. I mean, I can't answer the counterfactual. What I can say is...

DAVIDSON: I mean do you think the stakes were as high as the two administrations have told us they are, or...

WARREN: ...I truly don't know. And I believe here that people will be writing academic dissertations on this for another two generations, you know, as they...

DAVIDSON: ...But you must have a gut - like, do you think it was kind of foolish and they were overblown and this was really we weren't that dangerous, or do you feel like, yeah, there's a reasonable positive number chance that...

WARREN: ...You know, I'm not coy. I've just not seen the numbers. And I can't - I don't even have a good gut feeling because I haven't seen the data that would give me a strong push.

DAVIDSON: But isn't that the most important...

WARREN: No, it is not. What's most important at this point is that $700 billion was allocated to Treasury to try to improve this economy. And the device was through the banking system, to try to make sure that we have a working banking system. And look. I get it. We can't run this economy without a banking system. We cannot go to bartering pigs for haircuts. That's a nonstarter. So I get why we need a banking system. The question is, is the $700 billion being spent in ways that are appropriate, in ways that are truthful and transparent, in ways that ultimately are going to help this economy...

DAVIDSON: But wasn't the...

WARREN: ...That's what we're looking at.

DAVIDSON: ...Basically, the deal we seem to have made, that Treasury Secretary Paulson made with Congress in 2008 and this administration has continued is we need $700 billion to save our way of life. If we - this was not the stimulus money where the argument was we need 800 and whatever billion to lessen unemployment or to improve - you know, this was, we need 700 billion or we are going to be in a condition worse than the Great Depression. And so to me, if that's not true, then this 700 billion is totally wasted. There's not a penny of it that makes any sense.

And if it is true, then it - then I guess you do give the guys some slack. I mean, if it really is true that they had to quickly - I mean, when I give public talks, what I say is, they were, as far as we can tell, they were genuinely terrified. I don't know. But my sense is that Paulson and Bernanke and later - well, Geithner at the time, and were genuinely - they, as far as I can tell, I have no reason to think they didn't genuinely believe it - and that they clearly chose speed over transparency, accountability, and fairness.

They broke the fundamental rules of capitalism, which is that you succeed to the extent of your success, and you fail to the extent of your failure. They broke that fundamental rule. And that you're open about it and you're clear about it. But they did it to save the system. All right. Let's just go there. Do you agree with what I just said? That they genuinely believed it, and they chose speed over transparency, accountability, and...

WARREN: Look. I...

DAVIDSON: ...Fairness.

WARREN: ...I have no more information than you do. For this, I am an outsider. I was not there. I was not a party to it. But I have no reason to doubt anybody's good faith on this. And so in that sense, of course I believe it. They said we are in imminent danger of having a complete financial meltdown in the United States - I mean, I think that's part of the public record now. And I have no reason to believe they were not truthful about this. I'm just saying, I've never seen the numbers...

DAVIDSON: But isn't it - I mean, this is the missing...

WARREN: ...And there will be people who will go back and rehash this.

DAVIDSON: ...WMD, isn't it? Like, this...

WARREN: No.

DAVIDSON: ...Is - if we went to war with Iraq for WMD, we've spent $700 billion violating every rule of capitalism to stop the WMD in our banking system. If there's no WMD there, then everything else is irrelevant. This is criminal.

WARREN: It is...

DAVIDSON: If there is WMD there, then maybe...

WARREN: ...It is not irrelevant.

DAVIDSON: ...But you don't care.

WARREN: No, it's not that I don't care. What I'm saying is it's not relevant to the issue in front of us right now. Because, acting in good faith, Congress said, here's $700 billion to the Treasury, and here are the things it's supposed to accomplish. It's supposed to do something for the banking system, but it's supposed to do something for the American people, and something about home mortgage foreclosures. Remember, it's - all of that is written into the statute - here's $700 billion for that. It is the immediate job of the Congressional Oversight Panel to keep pressing on Treasury to see whether or - to ask them, are you meeting those goals, and are you doing it in ways that are transparent, that have high accountability, and that have some clarity in the program?

So we are where we are today. We have $700 billion that is - I have to do the math in my head really quickly - of 6/7ths spent and committed. And we got a little more out there, another about $110 billion to go. What's important is how we're spending that money and how it is we're using that money to restructure or not to restructure the financial services industry and the impact that's going to have on our economy.

JOFFE-WALT: And what if all those things can't happen?

WARREN: What do you mean if they...

JOFFE-WALT: What if all of those things can't actually happen? We can't do all of those goals that you just laid out. What if they all can't happen?

WARREN: Well, you know, you use the money in the way you can best. I mean, it's - nobody said at the beginning of this, this is exactly a $700 billion problem. Indeed - let's be really clear about this, because I think this one gets lost in the conversation. The first $350 billion, it went out the door, no strings attached. Henry Paulson said, here's the money. And there it is. All I have to do is certify that you are, in my standard, a healthy bank and you've got it.

You know, AIG, the one systemically significant, you know, that they started out with treating it differently. But here's the money. No strings. No tell me what you're going to do with it.

DAVIDSON: That's like, 250; 125 to the nine biggest banks and then 125 billion to...

WARREN: That's right. Well, and on down the line.

DAVIDSON: And on down the line. Right. Right.

WARREN: It's $350 billion...

DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah. All the way.

WARREN: ...That leaves.

DAVIDSON: Right. Right.

WARREN: And it leaves under a basically no-strings-attached program. And that's the end of Treasury one. That is the...

DAVIDSON: TARP one or whatever.

WARREN: Well, it's the end of Paulson one - right? - the Paulson Treasury. Then what happens is Geithner comes in. He only has $350 billion now, OK, and still clearly has a big problem on his hands.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: Geithner...

DAVIDSON: And by the way, 700 billion was never anyone's number. There were people whose number was 2 trillion. There's people...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Who's number was 1.5 trillion.

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: There's people's number was much lower, but 700 was just clearly a political...

WARREN: And even today, if we're talking about the Fed guarantees and the FDIC behind it, 700 billion's not the right number.

DAVIDSON: Right, right.

WARREN: But we're focused here on TARP. So Geithner comes in, and Geithner says, OK, I look at this, I've got 350 billion left, OK, that I could have to work with here. He immediately moves into home mortgage foreclosures, which is what the statute had told him to do. And he tries to put up a program that's going to hopefully cut down on the number of mortgage foreclosures, try to put some floor in the fall on the housing market in certain areas. He then says, I'm going to try the capital investment program - right? He tries these different programs, the PPIP, the Public Private Investment Program, the TALF, which is what our May report's going to be about. So to try to work on asset securitization, so he's putting some money here, some money there, some money here. And he still got 110 billion roughly, that he's holding in reserve.

Now, things will unfold. You know, there's - nobody gave us a guarantee one way or the other about what would be needed, what the right moves are, because the process is it moves back and forth. Treasury takes some moves, and the economy takes some moves, and the economy takes some moves, and Treasury takes some moves. I can say this - the way - Treasury two, the Treasury under Geithner, has spent the $350 billion or tried to spend it - is very different. And I will make this point. It is more transparent than it was with Paulson. There is more accountability than there had been with Paulson, and we're getting some...

DAVIDSON: Is there sufficient accountability?

WARREN: ...Programs. Of course not...

DAVIDSON: ...Sufficient transparency?

WARREN: ...That's my job...

DAVIDSON: Correct.

WARREN: ...This - you were asking what my job is. My job is as they get more transparent, as they get more accountable, is to ask them for yet more transparency and more accountability.

DAVIDSON: Right. But can I - so I want to get back to this issue of WMDs, because your basket of preexisting issues - the working family, the major shift in our economy from the 1970s to now. If our economy was truly in an acute crisis, and may still be in an acute crisis, then I am very sympathetic to those who say we don't have time to think about long-term structural issues. This house is burning down. And so I am inclined to think, maybe, Elizabeth Warren's issues are really interesting. They're really important. Maybe if we don't all die in the next year, or our economy doesn't collapse, then we can think about them.

WARREN: OK, I'm going to say it exactly the other way. But this is, you know, reasonable people can differ...

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: ...But I'm going to take the cut in exactly the opposite direction. We may be able to glue these banks back together. We may be able to give them enough money and let them earn enough for a long enough period of time that they will all fly through this storm entirely intact. That is at least a possibility - we don't know. That's a possibility. But I guarantee this - having an intact number of mega financial institutions will not save the American economy by itself. This is not some trickle-down theory or some, you know, we all fly on their backs. Ultimately...

DAVIDSON: And by the way, there's a very key point. And I've read - you know, Ben Bernanke wrote much of the key work in this area. I think any serious person agrees, we need a healthy banking system. I don't know of anyone who thinks that means any particular bank should...

WARREN: That's...

DAVIDSON: ...Exist. And I think everyone now, except for the executives of a handful of banks, agrees that this too big to fail top-heavy banking system is not the kind of banking system we need. So all of that - yes.

WARREN: OK.

DAVIDSON: And I'm not even saying that we need to...

WARREN: So we've got to have some banks. But the real point, from my point of view, is we've got to save those 117 million economic units that are known as families, households, and that...

DAVIDSON: Have you been reading Ben Bernanke's work on credit intermediation?

WARREN: Sure.

DAVIDSON: And, you know, it's fascinating. I mean, the basic idea is that banks or the banking system does something that no one else does, which is turn savings into investment, and creates the opportunities that make our way of life possible. And I spent a year in Iraq, which did not have a functioning banking system. And like many, many emerging markets or not emerging markets, it - when you're in an economy like that, the people who get money are rich people who are already rich, not smart people with good ideas who need access to capital...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Or good, working people who are a good bet on getting a house or a car...

WARREN: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Or whatever. And without that credit intermediation process, the life we live is gone, and we're closer to feudalism, right? Are you...

WARREN: No, no, I completely agree with this. But...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: ...But let's remember what happened to savings for the American family.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: The American family has not been participating in this. The American family savings rate has gone to zero, right? And it did it from 1970. A one-income family in 1970 was putting away about 11% of its take-home pay in savings, right? And what did that go to? By the 2000s, we're in boom times and the families are putting away effectively zero. But what has switched is that they were carrying back in the early 1970s - about 1.3% of their income in credit card debt, revolving debt, short-term debt. And they moved up to about 13% of their income in short-term high-interest debt. So the families I mean, it's - I'm all for this. I get the point. I understand.

DAVIDSON: But...

WARREN: I want a banking system that works, but I want it to work across a wide range of America.

DAVIDSON: So but...

WARREN: So we're all strong. The point is not to make the top strong, the point is to make us all strong. That's why this country works.

DAVIDSON: But if the house is on fire, you don't...

WARREN: What house? Which house is on fire? All the houses on the block are on fire. Families are on fire. Have you looked at the unemployment data? Have you looked at the data on foreclosures? Have you looked at the data on the number of people without health insurance who are getting sick...

DAVIDSON: And strikes you as...

WARREN: ...And who are losing it all?

DAVIDSON: ...That's as acute a crisis as the credit intermediation crisis, right?

WARREN: It's - they're - they are part of the same crisis in the sense that the financial services industry has counted on these families to produce revenues. And the big shock that finally occurred last year was that the promises that had been made in the subprime mortgage market, in the prime mortgage market, in the credit card markets, simply can't be borne up. The families just don't have that much money. They don't have the income to be able to produce on that. And that means that all of those fancy pools that were pulled together and put into trusts, and sold in securitization, and then sliced and diced again in tranches and ultimately moved into the balance sheets of banks, ultimately moved into my 401k, ultimately moved to China and Saudi Arabia and all kinds of other places, they're just not worth what we all thought they were worth because the families can't do it. So these problems, these are not two separate worlds. These are two worlds that are deeply integrated.

DAVIDSON: They're deeply integrated, but they have a different pace. The pace of credit market collapse and banking system collapse...

WARREN: You know, well...

DAVIDSON: ...Is an afternoon. The pace of the American middle class losing its way as a generation...

WARREN: I'm sorry but if you're losing your house, that looks like a pretty fast pace. If you're moving out onto the street, it looks like a pretty fast pace. If you lost your job - if you were one of the half million Americans who lost their job last week, that looks like a pretty fast pace...

DAVIDSON: But to put it horribly...

WARREN: ...That your house is on fire.

DAVIDSON: But to put it horribly crudely, to the system - or to me, OK, let's just - I'll be the jerk, OK? I'm not losing my job. I cover economic crisis, so I'm not losing my job. It's fun times.

WARREN: It's boom times for you. Yeah, you've got job security.

DAVIDSON: Right, I live in New York, so I don't own a house.

WARREN: You have health insurance.

DAVIDSON: I have health insurance.

WARREN: Good for you. Do you have money in the stock market?

DAVIDSON: Well...

WARREN: All right, there we go.

DAVIDSON: ...A 401k but not - yeah...

WARREN: Uh-huh, OK.

DAVIDSON: So...

WARREN: You're young enough you're not worried yet about your retirement.

DAVIDSON: Right, I know - I - look, I personally, if I could choose who's saved for me - like what I want saved, it's definitely the foreclosed guy over Vikram Pandit or Ken Lewis or whatever. Obviously, that's where my sympathy goes. That's where my heart goes. But I have been convinced that if - and I actually, I'm not even talking about saving the banks, like, I'm totally game for the idea that maybe nationalization is the best way or insolvency is the best way. But I am convinced that if the banking system collapses, that's going to hurt me much, much harder than the horrible number of foreclosures, the horrible number - in a more quick and acute way.

WARREN: Look, we get enough foreclosures here. You better understand - there's - the banking system cannot survive a high enough number - let's just not talk about where that number may be - a foreclosures or high enough unemployment. If you have enough unemployment, this is not about your heart. This is about your head. The profits, the product, is generated family by family. They're the folks who produce the haircuts and the cars and the socks. They make things. They go out and make it happen. They're what make this economy work. And if they lose their jobs and can't pay their credit card bills, if they can't pay their mortgages because they're reset, and they're crazy and the numbers just won't add up for - if they can't...

DAVIDSON: But we can have a - I mean...

WARREN: ...Pay when they get sick, you aren't - you can't save your banking system.

DAVIDSON: But unemployment can...

WARREN: You can't save a banking system independently of its underlying economy. It just doesn't work. The numbers don't add.

DAVIDSON: But the pace - right - over...

WARREN: Over what? Over a week? I mean...

DAVIDSON: No, not over...

WARREN: ...Over a month. We're at seven months now. And the American family keeps getting deeper and deeper into trouble. These two things are linked to each other. If the American family recovers, if they're strong, if they're really back and people are back to work, the American banking system starts to right itself as well.

DAVIDSON: So would you have spent all of that 700 billion on the American family to stop the foreclosures?

WARREN: I understand the point that we cannot advance an economy without a banking system. And I'm with you. That doesn't mean any particular bank is indispensable. A system is indispensable. It cannot be the case that, you know, I've got to be able to write a check and put it in the mail or put it in my bank and send it to my daughter out in California and not worry about whether or not some bank in Columbus goes up. And...

DAVIDSON: Right. Although, that's not the key issue. There would be other payment systems, probably. The key issue is the credit intermediation. They - yeah...

WARREN: Well, we got to have it, right?

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: We got to have this system and I understand that. We've got to have this system that works. We cannot run an economy without it. But having a banking system by itself is not a substitution for having a viable economy.

DAVIDSON: But - all right...

WARREN: It doesn't make the economy viable by itself. It's a necessary but not sufficient condition.

DAVIDSON: But that's obvious. There's no question about that. That's obvious...

WARREN: Well, then...

DAVIDSON: ...But the - what we saw...

WARREN: But I don't understand why our voices are raised.

DAVIDSON: I don't either. But I'm going to raise mine more...

WARREN: OK.

DAVIDSON: ...Because I think that what it feels to me that you are missing is that - and I am in no - I'm absolutely not endorsing the way either Treasury secretary handled this or any of the actual activities of either administration - in no way am I saying they did it right or they did it beautifully...

WARREN: And why do I hear a big but coming? OK.

DAVIDSON: ...But...

WARREN: But.

DAVIDSON: I think that in September and October of last year, certainly - and for much of the last six to - whatever it is - seven months - it is very reasonable, perhaps likely, that - I was there the week of Lehman Brothers at the commercial paper markets. Big companies were not able to borrow the money they needed to pay payroll that week. Major banks were not able to just get the basic cash they needed for day-to-day activity. You know, we've talked a million times on this show, the TED spread - which has historically been the most boring thing in the world - was up close to 500 basis points, which basically means the global economy was almost dead. And I remember we did one show all about the question of, was it clinically dead for at least a few minutes on the operating table? I think we put aside your pet issues. I think we put them aside. I think we put them aside until this crisis is over.

WARREN: The - this - you...

DAVIDSON: And then we - and I - and to make it...

WARREN: What you're saying makes no sense. Now, come on. What you're saying just - I'm sorry...

DAVIDSON: I don't - I think the...

WARREN: ...It just makes no sense. Yes...

DAVIDSON: ...The banking...

WARREN: ...On an emergency basis, on one day, one week, one month, there's no doubt in my mind, we've got to step in. We've got to make sure that we have a functioning banking system. I think I've said that like nine times now. Of course, we have to have a functioning banking system.

DAVIDSON: Wait. Wait. I want to go farther. I want to make you madder before I...

WARREN: No, no, no. We're now at - what? - we're now seven months, eight months into this. And it's the second part of what you said. We can't do anything about the American family until this crisis is over. This crisis will not be over until the American family begins to recover. This crisis does...

DAVIDSON: But - but that's your...

WARREN: ...Not exist independently.

DAVIDSON: But that's your crisis, that's the...

WARREN: No, it is not my crisis. That is America's crisis. If people cannot pay their credit card bills...

DAVIDSON: But you are not in the mainstream...

WARREN: ...If they cannot pay their mortgages...

DAVIDSON: ...Of views on this issue. You are not...

WARREN: What? That if they can't pay their credit card...

DAVIDSON: No.

WARREN: ...Bills, the banks are going to do fine? I - who's - who are you looking at?

DAVIDSON: The - you...

WARREN: Who says a bank is going to survive if the - who is not worried about the fact that Bank of America's default rate has now bumped over 10%? That's at least the latest data I saw. This is a threat back to the banking system. The threat to the banking system started when people said, I cannot pay my mortgages. The threat to the banking system is there every time one of those little producers that we also call families can't make the payments on these financial instruments. So the idea that somehow, we're going to fix the banks and then next year, next decade, we're going to start worrying about the American families, it just doesn't make any sense. The pieces don't add up.

DAVIDSON: The American families are not - I don't - what you said one day, one week, I think is one year, two years, five years. I don't think that there has ever been a systemic banking crisis. Japan's a disastrous example. Our Great Depression is a disastrous example - let's hope it's not 15 years - but Sweden, which people are holding up as a model example, Britain, which at least made some of the choices that maybe you would be comfortable with, it takes a year, two years, three years, it takes a while for this to perpetuate. And here is what - these issues of the crucial - the essential need for credit intermediation are as close to just accepted principles among every serious thinker on this topic. The view that the American family - that you hold very powerfully - is fully under assault and that there is - and we can get into that - but that is not accepted broad wisdom. It is...

WARREN: Whoa, wait. Wait. Remind me who it is who thinks that wages have not stagnated, that unemployment is not up, that debt levels are not up, that savings are not down, that the net worth of the American household - just in the last 18 months - has shrunk by 20%. I'm sorry, those are Federal Reserve numbers. This is...

DAVIDSON: Right, but that is...

WARREN: ...Not a question of your numbers, my numbers. We're not making this up.

DAVIDSON: But do you find that what...

WARREN: This didn't - I didn't get these out of a Cracker Jack box. These are numbers...

DAVIDSON: Unemployment is up...

WARREN: ...That anyone who reads the numbers - they're there.

DAVIDSON: Yes, we're in a severe recession, obviously.

WARREN: Well, so what is the part that is controversial? Everybody thinks that means it's good, that you can make your payments?

DAVIDSON: No.

WARREN: I don't know what world you live in here. The default rates are rising.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, obviously.

WARREN: And that means the income is not there. And this - the credit will not work in a system like that. We have to think about all of the parts.

DAVIDSON: But that view is a - I talked to a lot, a lot, a lot of left, right, center, neutral economists. You're the only person I've talked to in a year and a half of covering this crisis whose view is that we have two equally acute crises - a financial markets crisis and a household debt crisis that is equally acute in the same time and way. I don't - I literally don't know who else I could talk to to support that view.

WARREN: You know, I don't know what to say at that point. The numbers are the numbers, the fun...

DAVIDSON: And you are uniquely right.

WARREN: The fun stuff is to look at the big banks and how we've moved around billions of dollars there...

DAVIDSON: Nobody's talking about fun - what are you talking about? We're talking about a system that is the basic plumbing is dying. And maybe they approach it right, a lot of people - probably more people - think they've approached it wrong, the administration. This isn't about the administration, actually. What I'm saying - I literally don't know anyone other than you who has that view. And you are the person appointed to Congress to oversee it. And you are presenting a very, very narrow view to the American people.

WARREN: I'm sorry. That is not a narrow view. What you are saying is that it is the broad view to think only about trying to save the banks and to say...

DAVIDSON: No, I'm saying - no...

WARREN: ...Hey, the American economy will recover at some point, we'll worry about the families.

DAVIDSON: I am saying that we have...

WARREN: I think that that is the narrow view and I think I have the broad view. The broad view is that these two things are connected to each other and the notion...

WARREN: And equally acute...

WARREN: ...And the notion...

DAVIDSON: And equally...

WARREN: ...And the notion that you can save a banking system while the American economy goes down the tubes is just foolish.

DAVIDSON: But I want to make clear...

WARREN: It is not going to happen.

DAVIDSON: ...To the listeners, because I think we've lost a lot of listeners who don't actually understand why we're yelling at each other.

WARREN: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: So I want to make clear why we're yelling at each other.

WARREN: OK.

DAVIDSON: And let me see if I can define it and see if you agree with why we're yelling at each other...

WARREN: I - do I then get to give my definition of why we're yelling at each other...

DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

WARREN: ...Afterwards? OK, OK.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

WARREN: OK.

DAVIDSON: So here's what - let me see, and maybe even we'll agree about why we're yelling it. Or we could yell at each other about why we're yelling at each other. So here's what I think it is. That my view is that there are huge structural changes to the average American household income, debt savings - big issues need to be addressed. They are generational issues. They need to be addressed over the course of generation. Clearly health care, pension - all of these issues are massive and coming and going to get bigger. And at some point in my lifetime, they hopefully will be dealt with.

There is a short-term, and by short-term, I mean one-year, two-year, three-year financial market crisis that is much faster moving, much more violent, its destructive potential is more intense and short term. And they are - they may be - it's - I think there could be an argument that the household issue is a more important issue, but the financial market issue is a more acute, more pressing, more emergent issue.

So, you know, two people walk into an emergency room, one guy has a gunshot wound to his chest, the other guy has serious, you know, sclerotic problems. The triage nurse says gunshot wound, you're all we're thinking about for the next while. We'll get to you, Mr. Sclerotic, in a while. And we got to talk to you about all the doughnuts you're eating, but we don't have time for that now. We got to talk about this other thing.

WARREN: I think the difference is that there's a - there's another part that's happened. I've been talking about the American family. Look. You know, in 2005, when I wrote my last book on this, there were people said, hey, it's boom times, you know, stop crying wolf. You know, it's not that bad. The part you're leaving out of the story is that the American family is reaching a tipping point now, too...

DAVIDSON: On a one-year, two-year, three-year tipping point.

WARREN: ...Unemployment is now growing at a half a million a month. The number of families who owe more money on their houses than the houses are worth is now - we think it's about one in five. The number of mortgage foreclosures is continuing to rise. The only reason it's not rising faster is the banks aren't even pushing on people because they're afraid. They know how many people are now in complete collapse on being able to pay. In other words, the end that feeds the financial system. If you want to look at it from your perspective about saving the financial system...

DAVIDSON: No, no. They only reason...

WARREN: Oh, no, no, no...

DAVIDSON: I want to save it is for the us - I don't want to save it for it's own sake.

WARREN: But the front end, the notion of where this money's going to come from to push it back into the system and to help us stabilize on these financial products is with families, that now millions of them are in crisis themselves...

DAVIDSON: And that's a 2009 issue.

WARREN: They, too...

DAVIDSON: That if that's not resolved in 2009...

WARREN: This is a 2000 - well, we've got to start working on it, and we have started working on it. As you rightly pointed out, part of what we've done is we've looked at the stimulus package. Part of what we've done is we're starting to talk about healthcare. Part of what we've done is we started even talking about things, like how we finance college. So, you know, there are a lot of things that help put economic pressure on the family. And that means there are a lot of ways you can start relieving the economic pressure on the family.

But my point is we no longer have the luxury of saying we'll worry about the family in 10 years. We could have said that back in the 1990s, but we're now reaching a crisis point. We're coming out of a boom, a boom time, in which Americans made almost zero headway on income - that is unlike any boom we have ever emerged from in history. We always used boom times to get ahead and then you fall back in recessions.

DAVIDSON: Right.

WARREN: We are also...

DAVIDSON: Also financial market (inaudible).

WARREN: ...Coming out of a boom. That's right. We are coming out of an economic boom laden with more debt than when we went into it. That has never happened before in history. We have to pay attention to the signs, the hard data signs. Not - you can't dismiss me as, well, you're just an advocate because you care about middle class families. It's data. We have to pay attention to the data that tell us that the American family is now in a crisis moment. And we're talking about two patients in the emergency room. Or I might even say it's really one. They've suffered the gunshot wound. There's a lot of bleeding going on here. We - it is the wrong metaphor to talk about this as if only the banking part of the system is in crisis. The crisis is all the way through the system right now.

DAVIDSON: But I'm not arguing with that. I'm arguing - it's the triage. It's the triage. It's do we - what do we need to deal with...

WARREN: Well...

DAVIDSON: ...First...

WARREN: ...But...

DAVIDSON: ...And you are - but I want to make clear what I think - what I'm hearing you say. And I want to see if I'm hearing you correctly. You are saying that right now, 2009 is a tipping point. This is - in the other long-term crisis, the crisis of household unemployment, and debt, and lack of savings, we are in an acute moment where it is not responded to very quickly this year or in the next short period of time, or just like Ben Bernanke said about our financial way of life, our financial way of life is - now I feel like, you know, I feel like you've accused me of giving you cheap shots. I'm going to accuse you of giving me a cheap shot in that I'm not - I don't want to save the financial system for the financials. I don't care about the financial system other than it serves us, like, that's the only thing...

WARREN: Good. Then we agree.

DAVIDSON: That it serves - then it serves...

WARREN: Then we agree.

DAVIDSON: ...Human, regular people. I just think the triage is - there are things that if you don't deal with it this month or this year, and there's an argument to be made they're not dealing with them, but then we're screwed. And the stuff you're bringing up, I feel - I'm not disagreeing with the data. I'm not challenging you on the data, I'm not challenging you on the issue. I'm just challenging you on the, it needs to happen now.

WARREN: When - but, I mean, now is a, you know, is a somewhat flexible term. It doesn't mean between now and 5:30 this afternoon. But given what's happening in this economy on the income side with unemployment and stagnant wages for those who have it and cutbacks in hours, all the things that are going on there. And given what's happening on the outgo side - the debt commitments that people can't meet, whether it's mortgages or credit cards. We - the American family, there's no more flex in this system. They're out. We're now hitting more and more American families who are just smacking straight into the wall. They just - they got no place else to go. They're moving out of their houses, giving up their houses. They're in bankruptcy...

DAVIDSON: Well, we are getting out of a housing bubble. I mean, that - isn't that why, like - that's not the 1970s problem. That's the post-housing...

WARREN: ...Well...

DAVIDSON: ...Bubble problem, apparently.

WARREN: Well, but what we have are people who can't make their monthly housing payments. And for some of them, it means they're moving to apartments. For some, it means they're moving in with mom. You know, we're going to start seeing three-generation households now. Or they're moving in with the sister or, you know, somebody else. And for some, we're actually starting to see people in shelters. Now that's crisis time. This is important. And we have to think about these issues. And look, I just want to be clear here. I think even Treasury gets this. Tim Geithner's - one of his very first proposals when he gets in, is to say, I've got to do something about the mortgage foreclosure crisis. President Obama said the same thing. We've got to do something, because if we don't put a floor on this housing market, if values of homes continue to drop, it's not only bad for families, and it's bad for the economy, and ultimately ruinous to the financial system.

So I just think everything about this metaphor that, you know, we've got one in crisis and one, well, who's got some long-term problems, but we'll fix it by telling you not to eat doughnuts is just the wrong way even to describe it. Now I'm going to tell you why I think it's a wrong way in one more sense, since you let me have a shot here. And that is, it's a very dangerous way to describe it, because what it really says is, you know, American people, write another check for another multiple hundreds of billions of dollars because that's where the crisis is. It's not you - you're not at the table here.

When we're talking about solutions, just talking, just trying to figure out what should, you know, how should we describe this? How should we be thinking about it? You don't even have a seat at this table. This is a table only to talk about how derivatives move, and how the asset-backed securities market should be stimulated in the following ways. And that means that not only the question of the allocation of dollars, but the allocation of policy is different. The policy becomes about nothing but the insiders - about the banking system serving the banking system. If the American people have a seat at the table, then the conversation is different. And I think they belong at that table, making that conversation different.

DAVIDSON: And I think, luckily, we might be able to end on a point of agreement (laughter) because, I mean, if when I think about ways to sum up what we've been through, and I've talked to insiders who've sort of given me - confirmed this view. It's that, for probably honest intentions, good faith intentions as far as we can tell, a decision was made that you might disagree with, but that we do have to triage this crisis. We have to solve the banking crisis. And the way we're going to solve it is to transfer taxpayer money to rich bankers who don't deserve it. And lots and lots of people disagree with that. You know, lots of Republicans and Libertarians disagree with that, as do lots of Democrats and more progressive people.

But at the very least, you can understand that if you're thinking about speed, and you're thinking about just solving the crisis quickly, you can at least understand why they might have thought that. I don't think it was let's enrich our friends. I think they were trying to put out a fire. And I think they thought, well, politically, this is untenable. We can't sell this to the American people. So we're going to make it really, really complicated and really, really confusing. And my hunch is the people they were most concerned about was Congress. And they wanted to make it really complicated and confusing and...

WARREN: So what you're telling me is - and I'm the skunk at the garden party...

DAVIDSON: ...And that you...

WARREN: ...Because I keep coming...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

WARREN: ...In, saying, hey, you know, it's really not that complicated. It's really not that confusing. Let's make it all really transparent. Let's understand it completely, and let's give a chance for some other people to put some other points of view in here. You're right. I'm the skunk.

DAVIDSON: Right. And I think, frankly, we're trying to be the skunk as well.

WARREN: And on that, we can agree.

DAVIDSON: That we can agree (laughter) - that we're both trying to stink as badly as we can and...

WARREN: And be disruptive (laughter).

DAVIDSON: Be - well, no, we want - we just - I mean, honestly, I just want to - I - literally, I just want to explain it. Like, I think it's...

WARREN: Me, too.

DAVIDSON: ...As simple as that. All right. Well, now I feel like I don't even know why we yelled at each other so much.

WARREN: I know, but it sure was fun (laughter)...

DAVIDSON: It was fun. It was good.

WARREN: ...There we go.

DAVIDSON: Yeah (laughter). All right. Good.

WARREN: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: Chana, do you want to yell at us about anything?

JOFFE-WALT: I don't want to yell at either of you.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter) OK. All right. Elizabeth, no hard feelings. It was good. We're friends?

WARREN: I think we can be.

DAVIDSON: OK.

WARREN: I think we can be.

DAVIDSON: All right. Thanks very much, Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. All right.

**faster whisper:**
Initially, my department had planned to give each bank a numerical grade of 1 to 100,
100 being a perfect score.
But then we decided that that might unfairly stigmatize banks who scored low on the test
because they followed reckless lending practices or were otherwise not good at banking.
So we changed to a simple pass-fail system.
However, on reflection, a few of us felt that that system was too rigid.
So we changed it once again to pass, pass with an asterisk.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
It's May 11th, 2009.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
We're both here in Planet Money headquarters in New York City.
That was Will Forte from Saturday Night Live doing his Tim Geithner impression up at the top.
And we have a full and good show today.
We'll be talking about suing the bastards.
That's right.
Specifically, the bastards who caused the financial crisis.
Only, unfortunately, it's other bastards who caused the financial crisis doing the suing, but that's OK.
Bastards suing bastards.
Right.
And we'll talk to a securities lawyer about the pros and cons of that.
But first, Adam, our Planet Money indicator, a personal one for us.
The indicator is over 280 and counting.
Right. And probably well above that by the time you hear this podcast.
That is the number of comments that we got about Friday's podcast.
People, many people were not happy with the way I handled my interview with Elizabeth Warren.
And boy, did they let me have it in the comments section of the blog.
Our blog, of course, is www.npr.org slash money.
Elizabeth Warren, for those of you who didn't hear that interview or don't know, is the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the TARP,
the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Basically, she's Congress's bailout monitor.
That interview got a little heated.
We played a bit of the heated exchange here on the podcast.
And Laura, Planet Money's Laura Conaway is here and she can sort of fill us in on what happened next.
Yeah, Adam, I think you basically blew up the blog.
I know. Have we ever had this many comments?
No, we haven't.
And I kind of knew we were in fart on Friday when I went home and there were something like 67 comments.
I think the podcast had been up for, you know, an hour.
Right.
Something like that. Yeah.
And people called you all kinds of things.
And I'm glad to say that really only a few of them were things that were not actually allowed to post on NPR.
Like there was a code?
No. Yeah.
Like that one? Yeah.
Well done, guys.
Yes. Okay.
But there were any number of people who said, and this was upsetting to me personally, that we had been rude to a guest.
You never like to hear that.
I called up a listener who's been on our show before.
Her name is Renee Rico.
She happens to be a Presbyterian pastor in California who describes herself as an econophile.
She really loves economics and understands the counterintuitive stuff that goes on inside economics.
And Renee Rico said, you know what, you guys, you kind of blew that.
Part of it, Adam, was just the way you sounded.
I think just the tone of the interview itself.
I couldn't imagine him arguing with Tim Geithner.
He was so careful, deferential in his interview with Tim Geithner.
And I felt like, what's with that?
You know, I mean, my original comment, I think, even when I heard the teaser on the blog was,
it sounds like Adam is trying to get an upper hand on the interview with a woman smarter than him.
Yeah, and clearly with the Geithner interview, I was more deferential.
I like to think I tried to push Geithner, but I certainly didn't talk over him.
I was not rude to him.
And, you know, and I really do regret that.
I regret that part of the Elizabeth Warren interview.
Well, the other thing about it, Adam, is that Renee Rico and a lot of people like her, just like some of what Warren has to say.
And Renee Rico kind of put it for me like this.
She wants to hear Warren's arguments about the lived economy, meaning people's homes and jobs and credit card debt.
She wants to hear those arguments.
And then she wants us to follow them up so that we can find the weaknesses or strengths or whatever in those arguments.
Right. And I think that's my biggest regret.
I feel like that's how I let down the listeners the most is I just didn't give Warren a chance to lay out her views calmly, dispassionately or passionately.
And, you know, and then move on from there.
And, you know, that's certainly what we will be doing in the future.
I think it's safe to say all of us here at Planet Money learned a great deal from this.
Yeah. One of the things I learned, and I just want to say this, is that it is not necessary for all of us in the audience or here on the show
to agree about that interview.
Any given interview are the 280 comments on the blog.
But you Planet Money listeners have really kept the discussion on there at quite a high level.
I've never seen a discussion online go on for that long with as few comments as had to come down.
It's really civil for the most part.
Yeah. I mean, there was only one guy who called me.
Stop it. That got deleted.
PG on the blog, people.
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, it really is like you see, you know, you can, especially on the Internet, like, you know, where it's sort of bare-knuckle, no-holds-barred fighting.
You know, it was really impressive.
Right. It was substantive.
It was people responding to each other's views.
I mean, yeah, I found it very instructive and I really appreciated the intelligence of the discussion.
It's a nice crowd. Thanks, guys.
Okay. So let's move on to the rest of the show here.
The question on everybody's mind lately, it seems to me, sort of out there, is who did what to cause this crisis, this financial crisis? Who's to blame here?
Yeah. I mean, we're obsessed with it.
The nation is clearly obsessed with it.
Not just in some broad general way.
Oh, Wall Street's to blame.
But what exactly did they do? Who did what?
How did it get so wrong? What did they know?
How guilty are they?
And there's been dribs and drabs of revelations in Congress.
There's been some nice articles in the press.
But it seems like there's this one area that you and I have just recently kind of peeked into where there are right now hundreds and hundreds of people working all day, all weekend, all night, trying to figure out what went wrong.
And since this is America, of course, we're talking about lawyers and lawsuits.
Right. And we talked to one of those lawyers, a security lawyer named Zachary Rosenbaum, who is currently working to try to figure this out himself.
Now, he couldn't talk to us about the cases he himself is working on, but he did show us another case that's underway right now.
I'm looking at 42 pages of what some may look at as legal mumbo jumbo, but nonetheless is the description by MBIA, a large mortgage insurer and guarantor, of the reasons why it believes it was defrauded.
So the legal mumbo jumbo he's talking about might be one of our best shots right now at figuring out exactly what went wrong.
Who did what? Who's to blame? And that is so rare right now.
Yeah, exactly. Rosenbaum said that Wall Street's code of silence is worse than the one the cops have or the mob.
Wall Street folks don't talk about stuff like this, and they normally don't sue each other over things like this either.
They don't want to admit that they screwed up.
But right now, everyone knows that everyone screwed up so bad that it's actually not that scary to sue right now.
Right. So the case that Rosenbaum is showing us is MBIA, a major force on Wall Street suing Merrill Lynch.
Also obviously a major force on Wall Street. MBIA sells insurance.
It's a special kind of insurance on bonds that folks like Merrill Lynch create.
In this case, they were selling insurance on CDOs, and probably everyone who listens to this show have heard of those.
They're now called toxic waste.
Right. And Rosenbaum said that MBIA sold its insurance on these CDOs for very little money
because Merrill Lynch convinced MBIA that the CDOs they were issuing were totally safe.
And Rosenbaum actually, I think it's a little complicated, so he used something sitting on the table in front of him as a metaphor to explain.
I tell you, I'm going to sell you this bottle of Poland spring water.
And Poland spring, as you know, is some of the best water that money can buy.
And it comes from the springs from Maine or wherever they advertise.
And there is absolutely no risk to you that this is anything but Poland spring water.
So you just pay for a nominal fee, a very nominal fee, why would you need a lot of money to guarantee that this is good water?
Because it's almost money for nothing.
So I'm going to pay you a nominal fee, and I'm going to get your guarantee that this is Poland spring water.
And this is great water.
As it turns out, it's not Poland spring water, it's sewer water.
And the analogy is that Merrill Lynch, in this case, knew it was sewer water,
was in a better position than MBIA, notwithstanding MBIA's sophistication, to know it was sewer water.
And MBIA thinking it was guaranteeing Poland spring, guaranteed the sewer water.
And MBIA is saying, hey, if we knew this was sewer water, we would have asked for a lot more money to guarantee it
because sewer water is crappy.
Either that or we wouldn't have gone near it because we couldn't guarantee sewer water.
OK, so Adam, obviously right now it's easy for anybody to say Merrill Lynch and a lot of others sold a lot of sewer water.
But the hard thing is to prove that it was fraud.
Because for it to be fraud, Merrill Lynch had to know it was sewer water
back when they were first selling the stuff before the housing bubble popped and the whole financial crisis started.
So the key, in essence, to most fraud claims is whether there was a misrepresentation and whether a lie,
a lie that you knew was a lie when you said it, because there can't be an actionable misrepresentation of future fact.
I can't tell you that it's going to be, you know, I know as a matter of fact it's going to be sunny tomorrow,
even though I know the forecast is rain and be accused of fraud because it's a future fact.
If I tell you I know the forecast is that it's going to be sunny tomorrow and I know the forecast is going to rain, that's different.
But no one can make an affirmative present misrepresentation of a future fact.
So it's got to be when it occurred.
And here, at its most simple level, you know, and I take you back to the example, which is the Poland Spring bottle.
The allegation is that Merrill, it was able to know that sewer water was in the bottle while MBIA thought it was Poland Spring.
And that in essence is the claim. And that the fraud or the lie, as it's alleged, is that it was Poland Spring when I knew it was sewer water.
Merrill Lynch has three lines of defense, three ways of saying MBIA is not going to win this lawsuit.
Defense number one is, hey, we didn't know that was sewer water. We thought it was perfectly delicious water.
We were taken by surprise like everyone else.
Right. Defense number two, Merrill Lynch can say, MBIA, you are as sophisticated as we are.
You've hired the same fancy physicists and analysts. You have all the stuff we have.
If it was sewer water, you should have known it too.
And then there's defense number three, MBIA, we told you it might be sewer water.
I mean, we gave you hundreds of pages of warnings.
Any buyer of a CDO receives what's called an offering circular.
And one significant piece of any offering circular is hundreds of disclaimers,
usually comprising anywhere from 75 to 100-something pages of disclaimers called risk factors.
And one of the elements of any fraud claim is that you need to have reasonably relied on the misrepresentation.
And often in the face of a fraud claim, the seller of the note will say,
you could not possibly have reasonably relied on my alleged misrepresentation of some fact,
because the risk factors tell you so clearly all of the risks associated with this transaction.
Therefore, even if I said something that was a misrepresentation, you couldn't possibly have reasonably relied on it.
Therefore, your case should be dismissed.
You know, Adam, this makes me think just when you said that.
I've got to start reading all those software agreements that I'm clicking on every day.
You know what I mean? Right. Yeah, I know.
One day the people from iTunes are going to show up and say that they own my house and firstborn child.
Right. That's my terror too.
All right. But Alex, you and I do not happen to care whether MBIA is right or Merrill Lynch is right, right?
I mean, that's between them and whatever. I don't care.
The case that we care about is the people of the United States versus Wall Street.
We want to find out what did Wall Street do wrong and why are we the taxpayers on the hook for it?
Exactly. And Congress has clearly heard that sentiment voiced,
and they're making noise about doing something just like that.
They're talking about holding these hearings.
They've bandied about names of people who will lead the hearings.
Paul Volcker is one name, Sandra Day O'Connor, the retired Supreme Court Justice is another.
But Rosenbaum says there are dozens of these lawsuits, these big, huge lawsuits going on right now.
Wall Street insiders are right now being forced to testify under oath about exactly what they did wrong.
We do not need to wait for Congress if these court cases make their way to trial.
My opinion as a litigator, I think they're better.
There's an economic angle to it, which is you're properly incentivized because you want to recoup some of your money.
That puts you in a pretty good position to go learn the truth.
And that is, at our most idealistic level, what a trial is.
It's a search for the truth.
And that's why the American system allows discovery, because we want you to have the best tools in your belt to find the truth.
And part of that is going and getting the information from those you're suing.
Well, we can't wait to read more of this.
And we're going to link to some of these documents on the blog and make some pretty fascinating reading.
Also make some really boring reading.
Really?
Yeah, surprisingly long legal cases about securities fraud.
But there's some juicy tidbits.
We can highlight the juicy parts for the people.
Oh, that would be an excellent value added.
I like the way you're thinking.
And of course, do go to npr.org slash money.

Thank you very much for listening.
If I take a hundred years to grow it all, I'll sit and listen to the sound of sand and gold.
Thank you very much.
