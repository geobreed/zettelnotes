Credit card companies have decided to become your pal, before it's too late. If they chat you up instead of sounding threatening when you call, they figure, you might pay them back first. That's the message from New York Times reporter Charles Duhigg, who just published What Does Your Credit Card Company Know About You? While they're getting friendly with you, credit card companies have managed to learn a thing or two about exactly your ways. For starters, they're never happier than when customers buy premium bird seed, or put their kids' pictures on their credit cards. But if they hang out at Sharx, an upscale pool hall in Montreal? That's bad news. With a special guest appearance by Sharx regular Laura Roberts.

Jen Weiss traded a dollar for the coin.

Lisa Fleisher, a real estate reporter and blogger at the Newark Star-Ledger, sends this indicator:

    One.

    That's 1 silver dollar — a real, Dwight D. Eisenhower silver dollar.

    On Fridays, we have bagels in the office, one for a dollar.

    The silver dollar was in the coffee mug. People usually hang onto pieces like that, right?

    "People really are down to their last dollar" — that's Kathy O'Brien, the columnist here who brought in the bagels this morning.

**faster whisper:**
Christ has been up and down over the years, like many automobile manufacturers, and we
always stayed with them, you know, and we don't run, you know, and it was a mistake
we should have done something before.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson in Planet Money headquarters in New York City.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg, also in New York.
Today is Friday, May 14th, and that was Stanley Balzikas II, you heard at the top of the show.
He is the owner of Balzikas Chrysler, and he was recently told that he would be one
of the 798 dealerships to be closed by Chrysler as it restructures.
Alex?
Yes, Adam.
If I say the words, credit card company, how do you think people are going to feel?
You just hear that phrase.
Do you feel happy or do you feel angry or sad or some bad feeling?
I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I feel like the association is probably negative,
possibly hateful.
I think most people probably don't have a really great positive view of credit
card companies.
And that is what we're going to be actually talking about today on the podcast, credit
card companies, what we think about them and what they know about us.
Right.
We're talking with New York Times reporter and our friend Charles Duhigg about his
excellent piece.
It's in this Sunday's New York Times Magazine.
It's all about the credit card industry and how they affect how we feel about them.
But first, let's get to an indicator.
The indicator today, Adam, is zero.
That is the number of bank executives who've been replaced or forced out by the US government
after their institutions have gotten bailout money.
What's interesting is if you look at the banks and compare them to other industries
that have gotten bailout money, like take GM.
They got 17 billion dollars in bailout money.
Rick Wagner, chairman and CEO, kicked out by the government.
Same thing at others like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Both CEOs kicked out by the government.
AIG CEO is kicked out of the government.
And up until now, the government has had a lighter touch with bank CEOs.
No one's been forced out.
But Sheila Baer, the chairman of the FDIC, says that's all about to change.
In an interview on Bloomberg Television today, she said that as part of the evaluations
that the government has been doing of the banks, they're also going to be evaluating
executive performance.
And she said it's likely that some of those executives won't pass these tests and will
be getting the boot in the next couple of months.
It is a...
Some people say long overdue.
Others say, I don't know, we should be switching horses in midstream.
And others say it should be the shareholders' decision or the board's decision.
And others say the shareholders and the boards have not shown themselves to be making
good decisions.
It is a confusing area.
And if I could step in with a little bit of inter-agency gossip, some people also say
it's a FDIC versus Fed battle.
So we will be bringing you more on that.
But Alex, let's move on to credit cards.
Yes, let's.
Yesterday, we had our friend, New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg in
the studio.
And we asked him to do something.
We asked all of our Planet Money guests to do.
We asked him to take out his wallet.
Charles just wrote this really great piece for the New York Times magazine about credit
card companies.
And we wanted to know what type of plastic he was carrying.
So you have a credit card in there, an interesting credit card.
This is a credit card with my son Oliver's photo emblazoned on the on the front of
it.
Now that is incredibly cute.
Look at that.
He's a good looking kid, huh?
Yeah.
OK.
So this is an adorable credit card.
It is a Capital One credit card.
And the entire thing just looks like a snapshot of a very cute, very smiley Oliver
with the numbers on it, which OK, it's just sweet.
How nice of Capital One to allow you to have a picture of Oliver on your credit card.
But you wrote an article in the Sunday New York Times magazine.
And I now know this is like one of the most manipulative things corporate America
could have done.
Capital One has essentially turned my son into a marketing device for themselves.
And I fully participate.
And not just a marketing device, a collections agency device.
That's right.
That's right.
They got you to do it.
I mean, that's the most amazing thing about it is that I willingly went to their website
and I spent a good probably 15 or 20 minutes finding the right photo to upload so that
I could get it put on my credit card.
And what Capital One has told me and I interviewed some of their executives and
one of the things that they said and they didn't know that I had done this with
my my son's photo is that one of the executives said, you know, we find a lot
of people who go to this website called Card Lab, right, end up putting photos of
their children on their credit cards.
And the best part about it is they put it in the front of their wallet so that every
time they open their wallet, they can see their kid's photo.
And so that's the card that's easiest for them to grab when it comes time to pay.
And then and then they the Capital One credit card becomes associated with all the good
feelings that you have.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
It's you know, Foucault once said that we create prisons without walls.
Turns out we don't even need the prisons anymore.
Just need a website and a good credit card.
All right.
But no.
OK.
So if I had not read your really excellent Sunday magazine story about credit card
companies, I would have thought that all this is is marketing.
The whole point here is just, hey, you're going to like the card.
You're going to use it more.
But it's more than that.
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Because you have other credit cards in your wallet and you might.
Wow. You actually have a lot of credit cards.
So first off, looking at the five credit cards you pulled out and are in
front of you, obviously, you're going to grab the Oliver one just because you
probably have better feelings.
But it's more than that. If you owe money on those cards, which one are
you going to be more likely to pay?
Right. There's basically two questions that the credit card companies are
grappling with right now.
The first is how can they understand who you are better in order to
determine whether you're a good risk or a bad risk when they give you a
credit card? But then the second thing is, and this is particularly true
as we go into a recession, is that everyone is going to have too many
bills. Not only are you going to have five credit card bills every month,
you're going to have a phone bill and a cable bill and a water bill and a
rent bill. And what the credit card companies want to figure out is how do
they get to be the first bill that you pay or at least the first credit
card bill that you pay?
Wait, wait. Caitlin and Jacob, can you stop the tape right there?
I want to talk about the first question, how the credit card companies
make these decisions, because according to Duhigg's article, the way they
determine that is a lot more complicated than I certainly thought.
Before I read the article, I figured any credit card company has these
big databases filled with information about me that they knew how old I was,
what my credit score is, you know, where I live, where I used to live,
where I travel.
Basic data, basically, yeah.
Yeah, just like basic demographic data.
But what I didn't realize is those big databases are doing a lot of
analysis of every single thing I buy, you buy, anyone buys,
and trying to figure out what kind of portrait of a person that portrays.
He told us about a study that this company called Canadian Tire did in 2002
where they analyzed every transaction made by their credit card holders in
the previous year.
And we should explain Canadian Tire isn't just a tire company.
It's sort of like, according to Duhigg, the Canadian Walmart.
It's a huge company. It issues lots of different types of credit cards to
lots of different types of bars.
And what they found was pretty amazing that specific purchases,
individual products that you buy tell the credit card companies a lot about you.
What you buy, in fact, what we buy, what I buy, what you buy,
reveals things to the credit card company that we might not even know
about ourselves.
If you buy premium wild bird seed, chances are that you're going to end up
paying off your credit card.
In fact, that's the I think you said that was the single biggest
predictor, that actual purchase.
That's the safest type of purchase you can make.
And why? Because with the premium bird seed example, you're the type of
person who goes out and feeds birds you don't own.
You feel this sense of responsibility towards the world.
You're so obsessed about responsibility that you pay off your credit card bill
every month, even if you don't have to.
OK, so if I'm if I if I have a credit card, what do I not want to see on my
customer's bills? What is the worst?
What is what? What is the purchase that tells me as a credit card
executive? Oh, my God, this person's never paying me back.
If if Alex, if you if you were to buy a chrome skull accessory for your car
and if you were to use your card to buy drinks at a place called Sharks
Pool Bar in Montreal, you would basically be a credit card nightmare.
Yeah. Tell us about Sharks.
Well, this is real. You're not making you're not making this up.
This is what the data said.
And it's sharks with an X.
There are sharks with an X.
Right. The types of people who go out there and use their credit cards
for things like chrome skull accessories or at Sharks Pool Bar.
Data showed that those were the people who walked away from their deaths
most frequently.
Sharks is on St.
Catherine, which is kind of our main drag.
When you go in, it's I guess I would say it's pretty kind of like in the
basement.
That's Laura Roberts, who lives in Montreal and obviously has been to
sharks. Caitlin Kinney and Laura Conaway went on a huge Twitter fueled
search around the globe for people who have actually been to sharks.
Right. Because after hearing what Charles had to say about sharks,
we figured we got to find out what this place is like.
Right. His article specifically says something like 47 percent of people
who have been to sharks, who have used their credit card and sharks
will default at least four out of the next 12 months.
That's crazy. So we sent out this request on Twitter.
We said, anyone who's been to sharks, please
let us know. We don't want to talk to you.
And Laura Roberts was the first to respond.
Now, Adam, I have to admit, I didn't think the answer to our question
about sharks would come from a person named Laura.
I was imagining someone named Crusher or Bruiser, I don't know, Mongo.
I mean, I guess I was picturing basically the meanest, dirtiest biker
bar imaginable, like the place where you actually ride your motorcycle
into the bar and play pool from a copier hog and beat someone up.
Yeah. And you don't drink the beer.
You crush people's heads with the beer steins.
Right. Like a public radio kind of bar.
Exactly. Yeah. Laura says it's not like that.
It's kind of subterranean, kind of dark, kind of cool.
It's got kind of like, I guess, sort of an upscale vibe to it.
I mean, it's kind of weird because it's a pool hall.
So you think maybe not so upscale, but it's like very clean.
It's very well maintained.
Like the pool tables are not going to be all beat up.
And, you know, like they have, I guess, sort of a
not necessarily like a high class crowd, like it's university students,
but it's like people are behaving themselves, I guess, as opposed to,
I mean, I guess I'm more of a person who would go to maybe a rougher place.
Like a rougher place.
Yeah. Like I don't necessarily want to go to Sharks,
I would say, because it is so.
I don't know. It feels like it's a chain.
I'm finding this very surprising
and I'm going to get to why, but I have a personal question. OK.
How, how, how up to date are you on your credit card payments?
Um, hmm, that's a good question.
I think I probably need to pay them, but I do pay every month.
So do you go, are you late ever?
Um, sometimes, yeah, I try not to be.
But would you say that in the last year,
have you missed four payments or more?
Hmm, I would say maybe only two.
I mean, it kind of depends because I am a freelancer.
So the money is sometimes like, is it there? It's not there.
I can't pay them on time, but probably not for.
OK, but some years it might be four. Yeah.
OK. And it's not zero. No.
And it might be four.
Sounds like the last year.
You're not you didn't you didn't totally sell me on this, too.
I got to be honest. Yeah.
Yeah, it might be more.
That's sort of mind blowing.
It sounds like the Sharks, I guess, is sort of like
now putting together what we know about Sharks from Laura,
it seems like maybe it's more like an aspirational place.
So maybe it's like college kids and other young people and professionals
going to a cool place and maybe spending more money than they should.
And that's I mean, it's just it's very it's really confusing.
We actually called and I spoke to a manager at Sharks named Kelly.
And she said that, not surprisingly,
do Higgs story is making the rounds, they're reading it online.
And they are they are frankly just befuddled.
They have no ability to understand how they are the riskiest bar in Canada.
The closest they could guess is is that that it's sort of aspirational,
you know, people in their mid 20s who are maybe in their first job
and spending a little more than they can afford.
But they don't understand why they're on that list.
But that's that's the thing about this.
It's data. And so like that's that's what we're saying.
Like the credit card companies know the stuff that like
as a regular, subjective human being, you might not pick up on.
Exactly. And they have another problem the credit card companies do,
which they solve also using their analysis of who we are by looking at
what we buy.
The problem is, how do they get us to pay their bill first?
You know, if you have a bunch of bills and you're not in a position
to pay them all the credit, each individual credit card company is saying,
hey, pay us first, forget about those other bills.
So they are studying what we buy.
They also study what time of day we check our balances,
how we sound when we call them.
And all this information allows them to take a much more subtle
and, I guess, friendly approach to getting their money back.
Charles Dewey went to a training session where Bank of America
was training its customer service representatives
how to get people who owe a lot of money to pay up.
The folks who who lead these training sessions are enormously well intentioned.
There's there's no, you know, sort of evil manipulation
that seems to be behind the behind the screen here.
I mean, what they basically told these trainees was
become a friend to the people that you call.
And we listen to recordings of telephone calls where someone would say,
you know, my husband just left me and I can't pay off these debts.
And the answer that what the credit card representative was supposed to do
was to give them a shoulder to cry on, to talk about their problems,
to become their friend.
So one guy in the class says, well, look, when someone tells us
that their husband just left them or they their kid just got cancer,
how are we supposed to ask them for money at that point? Right.
That's kind of a terrible story.
And what the instructor eventually said was, you know,
you don't ask them for money at first.
What you do is you let them know that you're there for them.
And eventually that person is going to feel so grateful
that you're going to say, how much do you think you can send in this month?
And that's how the credit card companies get paid.
And they'll even go so far as to say,
we need to move you past this horrible experience.
Let's just get rid of this debt that you got with your ex-husband
and just move past. Right. Exactly. Exactly.
And we all know that this is true. Right.
Like it's when you have credit card bills, it's like this
like weight on your shoulders.
And if someone calls you up and says, look, I want to
I want to help you get past this weight on your shoulders.
I want to make you feel better about yourself and the world.
How could you not appreciate someone like that?
So from the credit card
company's point of view, you know, credit,
they've extended a lot of credit.
They're they're probably thinking a lot of it at this point
isn't going to get paid back.
The recession is we're in the recession.
It could be getting a lot worse.
Are they just sort of looking at this as like, oh, my God,
there's a tidal wave coming and we've got a.
Is are these training sessions sort of a direct response
to this fear of like ever rising defaults out there?
Absolutely. So there's been a big change.
So this stuff has been going on for years
because there's always been people who are who skip out on their debts.
But what's changed recently is a lot of the psychological profiles
that credit card companies would develop.
They used to use to sell you credit cards to try
and get you to charge more on your credit card.
Now, as you pointed out over the next five years,
about three hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of credit card
debts are expected to go bad.
So because we're in a horrible, because we're in a recession,
because people run out of money and they lose their jobs.
And and and it tracks unemployment.
And so now what they're doing is they're taking all of their science
and they're saying, we're not selling any more credit cards.
Now we're focusing on how to make sure that we get paid
and figuring out who responds to which type of persuasion,
which is all psychology.
It makes a huge difference.
And did they do that from the purchases you make?
Is that how they do it from everything?
Every single interaction that I have with a credit card
feeds into understanding my psychological.
You wrote that they write down how you respond when they call.
Do you sigh? Do you growl?
Do you say, hey, how's it going? Absolutely.
Are you chipper and upbeat?
Do you seem like really worried and and, you know,
worked over by this stuff?
Who is chipper and upbeat when the credit card company calls
asking for their money? I don't understand.
Says a man who doesn't have his child's photo on his credit card,
cold, heartless.
So I want to talk about fairness.
Now, there's a lot of upset when this concept of universal
default came out, that if I am late on my
Citibank Visa card, that my Chase MasterCard
interest rate goes up and a lot of people say that's ridiculous.
That's unfair.
My relationship with Chase MasterCard is that they have no business
looking at my credit report and figuring out what my relationship with Citi is.
This seems like way, way less fair.
Like if I happen to be in Montreal and I get a drink at Sharks,
my credit card rates going to go up because some other guys in Sharks defaulted.
And I, you know, I'm at Walmart and the guy next to me is buying me
is buying premium birdseed.
And I happen to like chrome skulls.
And it just doesn't seem fair at all.
It doesn't seem like a reasonable way to allocate credit.
I mean, I think that's a really you're you're obviously touching on
the issue of justice that seems to be the one that drives a lot of talk of
credit cards. But I guess let me pose it to you this way.
Two answers, the first of which is that capitalism isn't just.
It never has been. Some of us were born rich and some of us were born poor.
And some things like banking get paid a lot more than going on the radio.
Let's ask the question from the other perspective, which is,
is it fair or just that anyone on the face of this planet can go borrow money
from a big company with essentially no collateral?
Right. Like, I mean, I can basically be a guy who is homeless.
And I can in two years ago, I could send in a credit card application
and I could probably get a thousand or two thousand dollars worth of credit.
And then I could go buy an Xbox and then I could just walk away from my
debts. I mean, we live in a place where justice and fairness, when it comes to
money, has very different meanings now.
And they're evolving. And that's part of what this crisis is, is trying to
figure out what should be just.
Right. Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's the sort of the like when I think
about like there's so much anger at the credit card companies.
I mean, it's hard to find anybody out there who wants to come to the
defense of the credit card companies.
And I'm not sure that's what we're doing right here.
But there is the flip side of the 30 percent interest rate is just what you said.
Like, I can get a thousand dollar loan, you know, unsecured, basically.
And it's because they can charge somebody 30 percent that they can sort of
justify that risk.
Also, if I think about in my own life, like I spent a summer doing an
unpaid internship, which I funded with a credit card, which if there
hadn't been credit cards and there hadn't been 30 percent interest rates, I
would not have been able to do.
That led to basically I'm here right now because I borrowed all that money on
my credit card and that and I paid it back.
But, you know, it's sort of like you're borrowing your friend, you're
borrowing money from your future self is basically what you're doing.
Absolutely. And it used to be that there was no way in America to do
that. If you wanted to buy a motorcycle or go to an unpaid internship,
you had to save up for a year.
Then you bought the motorcycle.
Now you buy the motorcycle and you pay it off over the next year.
And some people would say it's better if you have to save it up and do it.
Some people would say that.
But but I think there's also a lot of other people who would say we live in a
better world now. If you look at guys like Jeff Bezos, when he started
Amazon, he lived off of his credit cards.
Right. There's tons of companies out there that exist because the
entrepreneur was able to basically float his life for a year or her life
on a credit card. That's an amazing economy that we live in.
It's the possibilities are so much so much bigger now because of credit
cards.
Then the flip side, though, is that like we are now living out the
consequences of too many people who shouldn't have gotten credit getting
credit. You know, it's like so that that is the that is the flip side of
that. And sort of the for every person who was able to make the credit
card work for them, there's somebody else who's sort of buried under
crushing debt who's not going to be able to pay it off.
Absolutely. And it's sort of hard to figure out like which balances
out. Is Jeff Bezos or me, frankly, worth some of these people in
your article who got who now are who now are sort of like their
credits destroyed and they're they're feeling overwhelmed and and
there are certainly things that credit card companies have done in the
past that are, I think, objectively unfair and very difficult to to
gel with any sense of justice.
For instance, people who had, you know, a relatively small credit
card balance because they had used it and then missed a couple
of payments and then their interest rate shoots up and they have
all these late fees and over time.
And this happens very frequently.
The late fees and the interest rate charges become larger than
the principal balance of what you actually spent in the first
place. And you're in this cycle that you can never get out of
where you can never pay off your credit card.
And are there we talked about fairness, but the other issue is
privacy. Do I mean, am I just legally if I use a credit card to
buy premium birdseed or chrome skulls, am I explicitly giving
the credit card company permission to do whatever they
want with that data and analyze it as much as they
want?
Unless the law is written otherwise.
And there's a debate going on right now about what the law
should say.
But in general, yeah, the transactions that you do with
your card, your card company is allowed to see and is allowed
to make decisions based around.
I mean, the question of privacy is a really interesting
one. And I anticipate that a number of your readers will
feel like I'm a I'm a shill for the credit card company
or I'm not harsh enough.
But the interesting thing about it is that when you ask what
credit cards should be allowed to know and what they
shouldn't be allowed to know, I think that's a totally
appropriate conversation.
Just recognize that there's consequences for every single
answer. So France is a great example, by the way, in
France, here in America, any credit card company, anyone
can request a credit report on me or you or Alex, and
they can learn how much debt I have, how many credit
cards I have, if I have a mortgage, they can learn a lot
about me. In France, you can't.
In France, to get a credit report on someone, you have to
get them to sign a form giving permission for you to
learn something about their credit background.
And as a result, it's much easier to get a loan in
America than it is in France.
It's next to impossible in France to get a loan.
So it's fine to place limitations on privacy.
And I think we should.
I think these are really, really interesting questions
that deserve a lot of sophisticated thought.
But the part to remember is there is a consequence for
every single action that we take.
And if we limit the right, if we limit the ability of
credit card companies to learn about you, they will
become more less willing to give certain types of
people credit who now get it.
