You're kidding me, thought Simon Johnson of Baseline Scenario, after reading an analyst's call for the U.S. to pay top dollar for toxic assets — or else. Johnson and Adam Davidson call up the person who wrote it, Joseph LaVorgna of Deutsche Bank. Plus: Adam put himself through a viewing of The International, a supposed thriller. For real edge-of-your-seat cinema, he says, listen to this tale from John Moscow.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Once Congress passes this plan and I sign it into law, a new wave of innovation, activity and construction will be unleashed all across America.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANNY ELFMAN'S "MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE THEME")

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello. And welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

And I'm Alex Blumberg. It's February 13. And today on the program, we have a good show. Economist Simon Johnson accuses Deutsche Bank of sending out a ransom note to the American people. And, Adam Davidson...

DAVIDSON: Effectively.

BLUMBERG: Effectively.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Not actually writing a ransom note.

DAVIDSON: Well - no, all right. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. More or less.

DAVIDSON: He also calls it a robbery note.

BLUMBERG: Robbery note. And, Adam Davidson, you, my co-host, offers us the first ever PLANET MONEY movie review of possibly the world's first-ever action-adventure movie about a bank.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE INTERNATIONAL")

CLIVE OWEN: (As Louis Salinger) Two years ago, we began receiving intelligence regarding the International Bank of Business and Credit. Anyone that's ever been in a position to move against this bank has either ended up dead or disappeared.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) You are accusing the world's largest bank of conspiracy and murder.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Of murder. Now, that sounds like a bad bank.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: But probably not what the policymakers were talking about when they were starting - when they talked about starting their own bad bank.

DAVIDSON: Right. We're not accusing Timothy Geithner of murder.

BLUMBERG: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: So that's the new movie out. It's called "The International," starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts. You might have seen the commercials. I went to see it the other day with a real live banker. Well, she's a bank attorney. And I'll tell you all about it. But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator, Alex.

BLUMBERG: Which is zero, as in zero foreclosures for mortgage customers of Citibank and JPMorgan Chase.

DAVIDSON: These two big banks say they won't foreclose on the mortgages of their customers for a little while so that the Obama administration can have some time to figure out the details of its foreclosure-prevention plan.

BLUMBERG: And we should note here that this only covers homes that the owner actually lives in. These are not speculator or landlord homes. And it'll only last a few weeks. But it sounds like, you know, a good experiment, anyway, right?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, but pay your mortgage (laughter).

BLUMBERG: Right. Right.

DAVIDSON: It's only - it's a limited-time offer. So speaking of experiments, we're trying one ourselves. Simon Johnson is often on the podcast as an expert guest. He was chief economist of the IMF. He teaches at MIT. We like Simon a lot. We work with him a lot. And so we decided to bring him in as a guest host every once in a while.

BLUMBERG: And in exchange, Simon is going to bring us on as guest IMF economists and MIT professors. Just kidding.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: It's actually...

DAVIDSON: That would be a very bad idea.

BLUMBERG: I guess - basically, what - the take-away here is that it's a lot easier to host a podcast than it is to decide which countries get bailouts and stuff like that.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And we should note, Simon is not accusing one of the world's largest banks of murder.

BLUMBERG: Just extortion (laughter). He wrote about it on his blog, baselinescenario.com. And, Adam, you and he talked about it.

DAVIDSON: So you brought us this piece of paper today. This is - having you laugh. Can you tell me what this is?

SIMON JOHNSON: Well, this came from a friend of mine in my early morning email. It's a note from Deutsche Bank. It's part of their U.S. daily economic notes series.

DAVIDSON: This is some staff economists there that send this out every day.

JOHNSON: That's right. And they send these round to clients and to people that they want to have conversations with, and of course, it goes to government. These are very influential, these kinds of things. When Mr. Geithner says, I'm looking for public input on how to structure public-private banks, he's talking about sending - he's saying, send me your research notes.

So this research note, the title is eye-catching. It's called "Falling Short: The Government Needs To Buy Toxic Assets." So it's a very straight statement, obviously speaks to the issues of the week. And the paragraph - it's a one-pager. And the paragraph that - the bolded text - they bolded it - that really struck me and, I think, summarizes the tone of it is - it says, ultimately, the taxpayer will pay one way or another, either through greatly diminished job prospects and-or significantly higher taxes down the line to pay for the massive debt issuance required to fund current and prospective fiscal spending initiatives. We think the government should do the following - estimate the highest price it can pay for the various toxic assets residing on financial institution balance sheets, which would still return the principal to the taxpayers. Now, if I can cut through the - if I can translate that, this is...

DAVIDSON: Right. You have a phrase for this note.

JOHNSON: It's either a ransom note or a robbery note.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: I think, actually, if you walked in - we should try this. Maybe we can do this afterwards. If we walk into a bank on the street and I hand this to them, will they give me a lot of cash?

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

JOHNSON: I think that is how you rob a bank these days. You know, you don't pull out a gun; you just give them a note, they give you the cash, and then they try to arrest you later. This is a robbery note. It's saying, guys, either you'll have 20% unemployment or debt to GDP over 100%, in the red zone. And this is in the document you and I worked on together and we co-produced, national debt. We'll push - national debt will go up to these dangerous levels unless you buy toxic assets, not for what they're worth, not for what the market price is - as much as you can pay.

DAVIDSON: All right, let's - I think we can get - this was a note written by Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank. So let's find out what this ransom-note-writing chief economist says.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE DIALING, RINGING)

JOE LAVORGNA: Joe LaVorgna.

DAVIDSON: Hey, Joe. It's Adam Davidson from NPR.

LAVORGNA: Hi.

DAVIDSON: Hi. So I'm on the line with Simon Johnson. He was - he's an economist with the Peterson Institute.

LAVORGNA: OK.

DAVIDSON: And he used to be at the IMF, and he also teaches at MIT.

LAVORGNA: OK.

DAVIDSON: Simon meet Joe.

JOHNSON: Hi, Joe.

LAVORGNA: Hi, Simon. How are you?

JOHNSON: Good. How are you?

LAVORGNA: Good.

DAVIDSON: So your note today - did you write it or you wrote it with your staff?

LAVORGNA: Me.

DAVIDSON: You wrote it.

LAVORGNA: Right. Yep, I wrote it.

DAVIDSON: OK. Excellent. Can you just kind of summarize? What are you saying? We're trying to, you know...

LAVORGNA: I think the bottom line is simply someone has to pay for the mess that's been created, and that's - there's no escaping the taxpayers on the hook. The taxpayer effectively is on the hook just simply because of all the risk the Fed itself has taken. We forgot about those arguments from last year about the Fed balance sheet blowing up. So ultimately, the taxpayer is going to pay. It just depends if it's explicit because the government goes in and buys assets above where the market currently is or indirectly through just us kind of going through this long, extended period of weak-ish growth. So my view - and there's a variety of ways with which this could be done - conceivably, the plan that was outlined - and outline is probably the best way to describe it - this week would help eliminate these toxic assets from bank balance sheets. But what I think is the most efficient way to go about fixing the problem is find a price that the government can pay. What's the most the government can pay with still a decent risk they're going to get back their principal?

DAVIDSON: So Simon has a blog that we're - baselinescenario.com, where he talks about current economic issues. And, Simon, you had some comments about this particular note today.

JOHNSON: That's right. I did on my blog - I didn't use names. I just put out the striking powers. I think, Joe, I found it refreshingly honest, but it also kind of took my breath away. And the reaction - so I put it out there, and I asked people what they thought of this key paragraph that you were just discussing and the key issue - the taxpayer will pay one way or another. And at least the people who looked at it, who, I must say, not generally people who rant and rave - it's a fairly sensible discussion on the website that they felt it looked kind of like a - I don't know - a ransom demand or a, you know, note you give when you walk into the bank and you say, give me $2,000. So one guy said, quote - he's sort of paraphrasing what - how he read the note. He said, "That sure is a nice global economy you've got there. It'd be a shame if anything happened to it." And other people sort of had similar reactions. I'm sure that wasn't what you were intending, but was there a shock - were you looking for a shock value here?

LAVORGNA: No, I think...

JOHNSON: Because I was shocked. I was shocked.

LAVORGNA: I've said this on - I've said it before in other outlets that - no, look. I just think that this problem is very deep. Look. Part of this - there's many people who believe nationalization is the only way to go. We're going to follow some type of Swedish model. That's the same thing. That's not inconsistent with what that note read.

DAVIDSON: Now, full disclosure, Simon, you are an advocate of nationalization.

JOHNSON: I don't use the word - I call it reprivatization.

(LAUGHTER)

LAVORGNA: We can call it whatever we want. But that's fair. I mean, I think that's...

DAVIDSON: I call it pineapples.

LAVORGNA: I think, look. I guess - no, the point of the note is that the problem is not going to go away on its own.

JOHNSON: I totally agree, Joe, and that's why I said refreshingly honest. But just on the nationalization comparison - and let's pretend we can use that word on national radio. I'm sure it's really banned. But, you know, nationalization - you wouldn't - the taxpayer wouldn't pay the highest price. They would nationalize - let's name a bank - Deutsche Bank. Obviously, the U.S. government doesn't get to nationalize Deutsche Bank, but somebody would. And then it - you're totally right. Of course, the taxpayers on the hook, and I think we're on the hook for the total liabilities of the banking system anyway, as you say, one way or another. But if we nationalize it and do - let's say we do the Swedish model, again, as a basic blueprint here. That's not paying the highest price, surely. And that way of cutting through it gives the taxpayer a lot of upside compared to some of these other alternatives.

LAVORGNA: OK, here's the thing. The problem I have with nationalization is that the market - equity market is trading on nationalization. And you see it in a lot of these various bank stocks.

DAVIDSON: Wait, wait, wait. I just want to translate some of this for our general audience. So what you're saying is that the people who are actually investing in bank stocks already think this is going to happen...

LAVORGNA: That's where - this is the route we're going.

DAVIDSON: ...That the government is going to take over the big banks.

LAVORGNA: It's a slow, inexorable march toward overt nationalization or something close to it.

DAVIDSON: Right. So here's what - oh, Simon, you had...

LAVORGNA: But here's the - so the issue is, look. There is a massive cost - and I don't want to use names, but if a firm ABC is going down, I just think it's naive...

DAVIDSON: Can we just say firm C?

LAVORGNA: What's that?

DAVIDSON: Can we just say firm C?

LAVORGNA: Yes, firm C. Right. If firm C is going...

DAVIDSON: Type C into Google and see what comes up.

LAVORGNA: ...Then firm B is following and then probably maybe firm J or perhaps maybe firm W because the market's not going - it's going to be a sort of a mini repeat of last September, where the market's going to look for the next target. If nothing else, the fact that the stocks of these other healthier institutions would, I think, go down significantly, their ability then to raise capital would be severely compromised. You can't just - I guess what I'm trying to say is you just cannot, in my opinion, selectively nationalize those institutions which are now insolvent. To do that, you wind up - I think you're going to see the market will paint everybody with a broad brush. And the ultimate cost, I think, will be larger, if nothing else, just through where equities would be.

I would argue - and again, I'm just - this is total speculation - but if we start nationalizing banks, I personally think we'll, without question, break the November lows of not hitting into the 500 to 600 on the S&P because if you look at the Sweden, their output collapsed much sharper than the U.S.'s. And they came back a couple of years later. I don't know. I don't want to make that bet.

DAVIDSON: And let's - I don't want to go too far down this discussion. I think we do need to talk about it on the podcast, but we're just running out of time. And this opens up a huge can of worms. I think, Simon, do you have a quick response?

JOHNSON: I think Joe's...

DAVIDSON: 'Cause I think you agree with some of that, disagree with some of that.

JOHNSON: I really think Joe was being refreshingly clear and hard-hitting on the analysis. And I agree completely about, you know, if you start picking - you know, nationalizing over weekends, doing one bank and then another bank, it's going to cascade in the way he's saying. I think what you have to do is reboot the financial system, and I think you've got to do that way that gets taxpayer value. And I don't actually think - Joe and I disagree on that - I don't think there's a lot of people out there who are completely convinced by this idea that we pay the highest price we can. Maybe if Joe fleshes it out into a longer document, we could see that.

I think that the view that I hear out there, the view I hear in Washington is, you know, unless and until - unless the treasury secretary comes up with a better idea - and I think I agree with Joe that he hasn't convinced us yet - you know, we're going to have to reboot, and that rebooting will include a big nationalization or re-privatization of a lot of banks - big banks, not all of them. And that's a big mess. And I agree with Joe also that there is no - there's pain. There's pain in that route, and there's pain in other routes. I don't think the Apple fall in Sweden was due to the nationalization, but it's not a magic bullet, no question about it. We are in a very tough spot.

DAVIDSON: And, Joe, I got to say, what I love about your note, if we - do you mind if we call it a ransom note?

JOSEPH LAVORGNA: I wouldn't prefer - if I was on my own, I would say fine, but I wouldn't say a ransom note. I would say a reality check.

DAVIDSON: What I like about it is I feel like the Bush administration and, I got to say, the current administration and many people in Congress meant - there's this game people are playing, which is that there's some magical recipe out there where the taxpayer benefits, homeowners benefit, the economy recovers, and it's just easy and good.

JOHNSON: And we'll tell you in two weeks what it is.

DAVIDSON: And we'll tell you in two weeks what it is.

LAVORGNA: Yeah. I mean, look, I try to be very - I don't say ransom, because honestly, I get paid based on our analysis and our forecasts. So I don't have an axe to grind. But it's remarkable. I mean, as bad as the Republicans have allowed things to play out - 'cause they've certainly responsible - the Democrats seem to be doing their best to, like, also not deal with it. And it's very disconcerting because there's a definite, you know, human cost involved.

DAVIDSON: So I'm going to wrap up, but I think both of you - and Simon, I'm going to just say to - because we have to be boring and protect ourselves - you're not at this second speaking for National Public Radio, its member stations or affiliates or the staff of PLANET MONEY, or - you're not speaking for your mother or your cousin. You are only speaking for yourself.

JOHNSON: And my blog.

DAVIDSON: And your blog. But basically, what both of you are saying is, no matter what happens, it's going to hurt. And it's going to hurt taxpayers, and it's going to be rough, and it might not work, but the more we do sooner, the better off we'll be in the long run. And the more - the sooner we face this reality, I guess, is the point, the sooner we face the reality that we're in way too deep for some beautiful solution that is actually good for everybody.

BLUMBERG: And now more bad behavior from banks - this time, murder. And PLANET MONEY goes to the movies (vocalizing).

DAVIDSON: Anyway. So, yeah, the other day I went to this screening of "The International." It comes out today. It's billed as the perfect movie for our times, a thriller about banking and evil banks.

BLUMBERG: And you weren't that impressed with this movie?

DAVIDSON: No. I mean, it's just an absurdly silly movie - you know, ridiculous plot, all of that. I mean, it's fine as far as, you know, big thrillers go - lots of shot - you know, beautiful shots of people shooting people and all that kind of thing. But as a piece of banking analysis, I would like to say that it is no PLANET MONEY.

BLUMBERG: OK.

DAVIDSON: Let me - can I give a quick plot...

BLUMBERG: But we are no action-adventure movie either.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, fair enough.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: So quick...

BLUMBERG: Yeah, give us a quick plot summary.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, quick plot summary - so a big international bank controls many of the world's governments and is stifling the efforts of our heroes, played by Naomi Watts and Clive Owen, to bring them down.

BLUMBERG: And you went with an actual banker - banking lawyer - Kathleen (ph) Scott of Arnold and Porter, and she also had a bunch of complaints about how unrealistic the movie was, right? She said she never...

DAVIDSON: She wrote them down on a pad.

BLUMBERG: Oh, she did?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And she told me.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: She read them off the list.

BLUMBERG: She never heard of a bank actually killing people. Banks don't control the flow of arms to African revolutionaries.

DAVIDSON: And what was even more inaccurate in this movie - this really drove her crazy - a real bank would have a much more diversified customer base.

BLUMBERG: It's so unrealistic.

DAVIDSON: It's so unrealistic.

BLUMBERG: How do people sit there and watch it?

DAVIDSON: They were exposed to one sector of the economy.

BLUMBERG: That's crazy.

DAVIDSON: No bank would do that.

BLUMBERG: No. But, you know, when you talked to her, she said she did try to ignore all that stuff and just sort of lose herself in the story.

KATHLEEN SCOTT: But in your mind, you start thinking, well, if it were a bank, you know, this is how I would have, you know, maybe changed the plot a bit to make it more interesting. And I'm sure, you know...

DAVIDSON: Like, what would you have done?

SCOTT: I don't know. But something more bank-like, you know, possibly, you know, dealing with sort of, you know, murky debt deals and, you know, bonds and, you know, making things obscure as to where things were coming from or something, you know?

DAVIDSON: You're not selling me. I got to be honest.

SCOTT: I know. I know. I'm not selling you. Well, that's the issue, too, as I mentioned earlier.

BLUMBERG: And that basically confronts - this is the problem with trying to make a banking movie both interesting and realistic. She basically sort of laid it out there for you right there.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I mean, our office is filled with books about banking, not one of which would make a good movie.

BLUMBERG: Right. But - which is weird because this movie actually is based on a real, live scandal, the BCCI scandal of the early '90s. And you tracked down the actual Manhattan assistant DA who did that case, who investigated that case, who in the movie is played by Naomi Watts. And is the real DA also a beautiful young starlet?

DAVIDSON: Let me paint a picture of John Moscow for you.

BLUMBERG: John Moscow.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: That doesn't sound like a lady's name.

DAVIDSON: No. He's a great guy. I - you know, I spent an hour with him the other day, and I really liked him. But, you know, as he himself said, he's not pretty.

BLUMBERG: So let me get this straight. They took a rumpled, post-middle-aged, male Manhattan ADA, and turned him into a young, leggy blonde for the movie.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And, OK, we can understand that change.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: That change makes sense.

BLUMBERG: But he told you also that they didn't just change his sex and age and looks and hair color.

DAVIDSON: Are there any shootouts, like, at the Guggenheim Museum or in the middle of Istanbul?

JOHN MOSCOW: I am not aware of any.

DAVIDSON: Of any gunfire or assassinations?

MOSCOW: Correct.

DAVIDSON: All right. So first of all, Alex, I got to say, I was so excited. Like, I saw this movie, and then I find the real guy, and he's, like, three blocks from our office. I go over and hang out with him. He didn't even know there was a movie coming out about him, basically.

BLUMBERG: Oh, really?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. He didn't know anything about it.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

DAVIDSON: So it was really fun. So he told me what really happened - you know, the actual case. And everything he said, I kept thinking, that's the movie I want to see - the one he's actually describing, the real case. Hollywood actually made the story less interesting. The movie story is kind of cliched and simple. The real story is, like, juicy and fascinating. So let me - I'll give you...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Kind of a quick rundown. I've been reading about this all day. So the real bank, BCCI, Bank of Credit and Commerce International was owned by this elusive Indian Pakistani British banker who had deep connections to powerful American figures, Middle Eastern leaders, drug dealers, Latin American revolutionaries. And many of his bank executives in the U.S. were staples of, you know, New York and D.C. high society. There had been rumors about this bank for years that it was crooked. But people in the U.S. government, in the U.K. and France and really all over the world were - did successfully stop all sorts of investigations.

But finally, in the late '80s Moscow's boss, the Manhattan DA, you know, this famous guy, Robert Morgenthau, let Moscow loose on the case. He just said, I'm going to protect you. Go for it. And Moscow found out that the bank - he calls it Commerce - had lots of shady business. Some of the employees of the bank were laundering money for criminals and child sexual slave traders.

MOSCOW: There were other people in Commerce dealing in unlicensed pharmaceutical products, like heroin and cocaine, that...

DAVIDSON: And arms as well - some arms trading.

MOSCOW: Yes. The arms trading came in a number of different sorts and kinds. You had the private arms dealers, some of whom got caught. You had Chinese Army factories shipping weapons. You had possibly authorized, possibly not authorized sales of U.S. and British military equipment. There were some wonderful transactions involving French Mirage.

DAVIDSON: The fighter jets.

MOSCOW: Fighter jets. OK? There was all sorts of stuff.

DAVIDSON: So I asked Moscow to describe if we did shoot the movie of his real life, the real-world investigation, what would it look like? What are the visuals?

BLUMBERG: Which sounds - I mean, when he describes it - I mean, like, just sort of, like, all this unauthorized arms dealing and crazy stuff going on - all sorts of stuff, as he says - I mean, it sounds like - why not?

DAVIDSON: I mean, that - yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: You could make a really good movie about that.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: But if you want to follow the investigators like the...

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Like this movie "The International" does, if you just want to follow him and the other - there were other investigators around the world - Moscow said, you know, Hollywood would really have a problem...

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Making that movie because basically it would take place in lawyers offices, you know? He'd be talking to someone on the phone. He'd go visit someone else's office. They'd be reading a pile of papers. But he says, in the end, he and, you know, these other investigators around the world brought down this huge bank and sent a lot of people around the world to jail. But it wasn't all positive from his perspective. There were innocent people all over the world who lost their life savings. Hundreds of thousands of people, he said, were really hurt financially.

BLUMBERG: 'Cause they had to close down this bank.

DAVIDSON: Because they closed down this bank in parts of the world where there isn't FDIC insurance. And the bank had a lot of customers who were, you know, struggling immigrants from India to England, things like that, who just lost everything.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

DAVIDSON: You know, it's like the Bernie Madoff story. And as a result of this investigation, the world has changed a bit. Like, banking laws all over the world were changed pretty dramatically to prevent this kind of thing from happening again. Like, now banks no longer can say, oh, it's my customer's money. I don't know what it is. There's this new principle - know your customer. Bankers have to know what their customers are up to. So basically he said there was real drama in his life at that time, but he's not convinced it's something a movie camera could pick up.

BLUMBERG: Right. And, you know, another really crazy side note, which - when you were on the phone - I heard you on the phone talking to this guy, setting up the interview - and you said - I heard you say Moscow. When I asked what his name was, you said John Moscow. And he showed up in a "This American Life" story.

DAVIDSON: A story I love - I mean, I remembered it. I just didn't...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Remember the name.

BLUMBERG: Several years ago, about - it's a story that appeared on "This American Life" about - by Jack Hitt, a contributor to "This American Life" and a magazine journalist who lived in New York in the '80s and whose landlord - he lived in this just regular building on the Upper West Side. And his landlord, it turned out, with the aid of his - the building superintendent had murdered somebody and then was sort of engaged maybe to murder more people. And John Moscow was the guy who actually investigated the case and put the guy away.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. He's a - I mean, I guess basically you grab any Manhattan assistant district attorney who was there for a while, and they must have unbelievable stories.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

DAVIDSON: All right. Well, I think that's a wrap, Alex.

BLUMBERG: Yep.

DAVIDSON: Murder, extortion, drug running, sexual slavery.

BLUMBERG: Who says banks are boring?

DAVIDSON: Please send us your thoughts, your angry letters, photos of the recession to us. You can do it through our blog at npr.org/money, or email us at planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Adam Davidson.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thank you very much for listening.
