PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There are times where you can afford to redecorate your house, and there are times where you need to focus on rebuilding its foundation. Today, we have to focus on foundations.

(SOUNDBITE OF M.I.A. SONG, "HUSSEL")

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

And I'm Laura Conaway. This is Friday, February 27. And I think I'm looking at a very tired Adam Davidson.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, it's been an intense week, a good week. We have brought you stories on Morning Edition, on All Things Considered, and, of course, culminating in our big hour on This American Life this weekend. Ira, I got to say, says...

CONAWAY: Ira Glass?

DAVIDSON: Ira Glass says it's brilliant. It's wonderful. Alex and I say we're too tired and too - we've been working too hard and we have no perspective whatsoever. But I think it will be a good hour where we're going to really try and just - in a simple, straightforward way, like we did on the subprime mortgage crisis last year, just explain how banks work and what's wrong with them and some of the ways to fix them.

CONAWAY: Cool. For right now, we're going to talk about one of the ways for fixing a bank or maybe a way that one person doesn't want to see us fix the banks. And we're also going to hear from economists about your interview, Adam. One of the things that happened to you this week was you talked to Tim Geithner.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, the treasury secretary. Let's get to that in a minute. But first, there is a lot of news today on Friday. We've heard about this all week, but Citigroup does seem to have a new deal with Treasury. The government, you may remember, gave them $45 billion in exchange for preferred stock in Citigroup. Now, Citigroup, they're not getting new money. What they're doing is they're converting 25 billion of that 45 billion from preferred stock to common stock. That's roughly 25. The government says they want to go halfsies, basically, that they want Citigroup to find someone else.

CONAWAY: Man. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: So this means that the government could end up owning a far more significant share of the company, more than a third of it. But crucially, this was carefully, carefully designed to prevent the U.S. government from owning a majority of Citigroup and becoming its primary owner. But this does mean that the government will have voting rights, that they'll be able to kick people off the board, it seems like, and have a lot of influence over how Citigroup is run, even more than they do already.

CONAWAY: OK. But none of those numbers in the Citigroup deal are the ones that especially shocked us today.

DAVIDSON: No, 'cause there was one number that really...

CONAWAY: Big.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, this shocked us. This was our PLANET MONEY indicator, 6.2%, which is how much the U.S. economy shrunk by if you did it on an annualized basis using seasonally adjusted data for the last three months of 2008.

CONAWAY: Yeah. And that number is actually revised down from an earlier figure for gross domestic product, which is - course, is the sum total of everything bought and sold and paid and earned. The government originally said that GDP had been shrinking at 3.8%.

DAVIDSON: Which is pretty bad. I mean, a healthy economy, a healthy U.S. economy should be growing at 2.5-, 3% a year. So shrinking at any rate is bad, but shrinking at 3.8% is bad. Economists were very pessimistic. They said, I think that 3.8% number is a little low. We think the economy really shrunk at an annual rate of 5.4%.

CONAWAY: Yeah, but this thing, this - when they go back and tote it all up again and put in the final numbers and it comes out 6.2%, that is the worst shrinkage in a quarter century.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, I get so tired - I got to be honest - of every week having to read numbers and say, and that's the worst in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years. But there it is.

CONAWAY: There it is.

DAVIDSON: It's - we're reporting the facts. So at the end of the show, we're going to have a main street indicator for you from someone whose work has, like the U.S. economy, been shrinking a fair amount.

CONAWAY: So, Adam, in the middle of all this work you've been doing, you've had a couple of really interesting phone calls. One of them was with this guy William Isaac.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. He calls himself Bill. He tells everyone to call him Bill. He ran the FDIC back in the early 1980s. And I talked to him a lot about bank nationalization because, as the former head of the FDIC, he has a unique perspective on this issue.

CONAWAY: So what does he think?

DAVIDSON: All right. Basically, he says he personally, and uniquely, has been down this nationalization road before. And he says it's - in his view, it's a bad idea.

WILLIAM ISAAC: If you define nationalization the proper way, which is the government seizes control of the ownership and management of a company - in this case, a bank - as far as I know, I am the only person who has ever nationalized a bank in the United States.

DAVIDSON: What happens when you take over a bank, when you nationalize a bank? What - how many people are involved? How many people at the FDIC working for you were involved?

ISAAC: Oh, I don't know how many, but it probably was - at least a hundred or 200 people were involved.

DAVIDSON: And what are they doing? I mean, you don't suddenly have a guy from the FDIC working the teller window - right? - or, you know, stocking the coffee in the lobby or whatever. What do you do? What - do you eliminate positions and take them over? Is there actual government officials in the bank? How does it work? What's the mechanics...

ISAAC: Well, what we did back then was to try to do it in a way in which we had as little involvement as we could have. And one thing we did was we hired - you know, we brought about - I think it was about $5 billion of problem loans from Continental, and we - at a discount. And we hired Continental to manage those problem loans for us and collect them and service them and the like. We gave them an incentive arrangement, so they had every reason to make the collections properly. And then we also gave them guidance on what they had authority to do and what they needed approval from us to do. And then we had a team of people, lawyers and business people, from the FDIC who oversaw that collections and servicing process by Continental.

DAVIDSON: So...

ISAAC: And that's probably where most of the people that - would have been involved. We also removed - oh, I don't know - I think it was about two-thirds of Continental's board and required the bank to nominate new directors and subject to FDIC approval. We eliminated some of the top management. And we hired new people to come in and run Continental.

DAVIDSON: So it's kind of like if Warren Buffett had bought the bank. He might have said, well, I now have the vast majority of shares. I'd like to get rid of a bunch of board people. I don't like the management. It's not that terribly different, right?

ISAAC: Yeah. And the other thing is, though, the other things were pretty harsh because we said, give us a business plan for shrinking this bank by 50% within the next three years.

DAVIDSON: Which is not what Warren Buffett would've done.

ISAAC: No, he would not do that. He would say, give me a business plan for making it twice as big as it is in the next three years or something like that. And so our objective was to shrink this thing down and have it be less risky. And we also required - we had the right to approve hiring and firing decisions and compensation for senior people. And we also required our approval if they were going to undertake any new business activities or increase the risks in any way in the bank.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I wanted to go through - what were they allowed to do on their own without calling you guys? And what - when did they have to call you? Like, would the new CEO be on the phone with the FDIC every couple hours, do you think? Or was it once a week?

ISAAC: They had a - they knew what the rules were. And that is, if they wanted to make some major investments and - anything day to day, we didn't get involved in. But if they wanted to deal with hiring and firing the top - I don't know how many people it was - let's say 20 or 30 people and the compensation of those people, they needed to clear that through us. And if they were going to undertake any kind of new business initiative of consequence, they needed to come to us. But, no, they didn't call us every day.

DAVIDSON: And - but it's kind of weird. It's - they're no longer running it like any private business, to grow and make a steady profit, right? They were running it - they had this other goal, to shrink. I mean, it's hard to find a business whose goal is to shrink.

ISAAC: No, that's exactly right. And that's one of the things that I wrote in The Wall Street Journal. I don't see how you do it without destroying our economy. Continental held just under 2% of the banking assets in the United States. The three or four largest banks today have somewhere around 50% of the banking assets. If we were to try to nationalize them, they are going to shrink significantly, partly because the FDIC or the regulators generally will want them to shrink so that they can reduce the risks. It would be unacceptable for them to take on new risks and big new losses while they were owned by the FDIC. And - but even if they didn't want them to shrink, they would shrink because the marketplace would run away from them.

DAVIDSON: And so, yeah, let me understand that. So - because I got to say, so far, you've made me feel like, well, nationalization isn't that big a deal. You get a hundred technocrats to sort of oversee some details. You get some, you know, respected graybeards in there. And you give them some clear instructions. And that's that. Why can't we just do that for Citibank and Bank of America and...

ISAAC: If you were to do that today, you're talking about incapacitating, essentially, half the banking system. I mean, if you were to nationalize, let's say, the top four banks - and I don't believe we can stop at one, you know? Some people think, well, why don't we just do it with this one? Well, I believe that the marketplace would take several of them down. They'd...

DAVIDSON: You mean, if you do Citibank, then Bank of America shareholders and bondholders will freak out and run away. And then, basically, Bank of America collapses and you have to take them over.

ISAAC: Without using the names, because I don't like to talk about specific banks, but I believe that if you were to take down one of the big banks that then the short sellers and speculators would attack the next one. And once they got that one stock down to a penny or whatever, they'd come after - and it got nationalized, they'd come after the next one. I'd - this marketplace has been brutal.

DAVIDSON: Is there a manpower constraint here? I mean, you had a hundred people to nationalize - and I know we're talking rough numbers here, but roughly a hundred people to nationalize a $40 billion bank. Is it sort of equivalent to a $2 trillion bank, which is - I'm just doing the math in my head; 10, a hundred - like, 50 times bigger? So would it need 5,000 people? Or does it not quite work that way?

ISAAC: No, it (laughter) probably does work that way. You'd need a lot of people. And these banks are also so - they're so much more complex today. And they're spread out all over the globe. Continental was pretty plain vanilla by today's standards.

DAVIDSON: It didn't have bizarre securitized assets that maybe even the lawyer who invented them doesn't understand them completely. Yeah.

ISAAC: And, you know, the other - we haven't even gotten to the other part of it, which is once you do nationalize, let's say, several of these banks, what are you going to do with them? In the case of Continental, the FDIC didn't - wasn't able to divest it for seven years. It was seven years before it got rid of its - all of its interest in Continental.

DAVIDSON: And why is that? Just, like, you couldn't find a buyer who wanted a piece of it? You couldn't make a deal?

ISAAC: Well, I mean, I left the FDIC within, probably, a year or so after taking over Continental. So I can't really talk about, with firsthand knowledge, as to why they took as long as they did to get rid of it. I know they, I think - well, the strategy they took was they started unloading parts of it in public offerings. And the market can only digest so much at once. And so they - I think they did - my memory is they did several public offerings until they got it public entirely. And then, about three years after the FDIC got out, the Bank of America bought it, so it didn't stick. It didn't - it never did become a viable competitor again.

DAVIDSON: So...

ISAAC: But anyway, let's say we have three or four of these banks nationalize. They control 50% of the banking system. And they - you know, before nationalization, they're - they total maybe $8 trillion in size.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

ISAAC: Where - who are you going to sell them to? I don't know how you do a public offering that big or a series of public offerings that big.

DAVIDSON: Since you're selling the only companies big enough to buy...

ISAAC: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Themselves.

ISAAC: And you can't sell to foreign interests. You can't - we're never going to accept a foreign power having that kind of control over our economy. So you can just take all that foreign money or most of it off the table. It can be part of a deal. But it can't be a major part of a deal, or it's not going to pass muster.

CONAWAY: Adam, we'll link to that - Bill Isaac's piece in The Wall Street Journal when we post the podcast today. It'll be on the blog at npr.org/money for you out there. And you, Adam, had yet another call that - this one made a really big splash right here at PLANET MONEY world headquarters.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, that was when we got a call from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's office saying he would give us an interview. And I'll be honest, I did - I asked for a lower-level staffer. I even said off the record is fine. I just want to go over some details. And then they say, well, do you want to talk to the man himself?

CONAWAY: So we posted the whole thing, the whole conversation on the podcast Wednesday. And listeners, ever since, you guys have just been all over the map about it.

DAVIDSON: Right. I mean, Geithner clearly - you know, let's be fair, he stayed very much on message. And a lot of people, myself included, were trying to read through and trying to figure out - what the substance that he was saying? - because there was a lot of...

CONAWAY: Talking points?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, it was straight talking points.

CONAWAY: Yeah. But personally, I did think that he said some things that had substance to them. And in any event, we wanted to see what economists might say because, you know, they live in a different world. And they might hear what he was saying differently.

DAVIDSON: Right. So one guy we thought of right away was Amir Sufi, who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He says, of course Geithner stayed on message. He is, in many ways, the most influential man in the world right now. If he orders the wrong thing for lunch, it could cause a bank run.

CONAWAY: Yeah. And Geithner had to speak very, very carefully. But there is this one part, Adam, where Amir Sufi says he thinks that Tim Geithner tipped his hand. And I have to say, this part is mostly you, Adam. You're talking about a dollhouse that was bought with a mortgage for a hundred bucks.

DAVIDSON: Right. This is a metaphor that we used on the podcast before to explain how banks work. And it's something that will play a big role in our This American Life show. And it's something I talked to the Treasury secretary about. So in my stylized example, if I can - see if I can paraphrase you. You're saying the market thinks that house is worth $50, not because the house isn't worth that much, but because people aren't buying dollhouses because they can't get the financing. We feel confident that six months, a year, two years from now, that house will be closer to its par value, closer to a hundred. So it makes no sense for us to force that bank to collapse under the weight of the deficit.

TIMOTHY GEITHNER: Very well said.

CONAWAY: So Amir Sufi told me that what he hears in this is there are two ways you can view the bank crisis. The first is that it's this problem of insolvency, meaning that some of the big banks are really, truly broke and there is no reason to keep pouring taxpayer money into them.

DAVIDSON: Right. The government should just take them over, if you believe that, but - and then sell them to someone else. But the other argument is that we don't have an insolvency problem. We just have a liquidity problem. That's a fancy way to say that the banks have all these toxic assets, but they're really worth something more than people are willing to pay now. But people just don't have the money to pay, so they're not paying for it right now. But if the government can just kind of help the banks muddle through a while, the situation will stabilize, the banks will be healthy again, all will be well.

CONAWAY: So when Geithner says to Adam, that's very well said, Amir Sufi hears liquidity crisis.

AMIR SUFI: You never know what these guys actually believe, right? Because they can't say what they actually believe. But he did a pretty convincing job that he really does believe that this is just a liquidity problem. And therefore, the role of the government is to inject equity to get these banks through this liquidity crisis with the view that, look; you don't want to come in and restructure or force these guys into Chapter 11 or nationalize because they're not insolvent. They're perfectly solvent. They just need to get through these rough patches.

CONAWAY: Do you, yourself, come down on one side of the debate or...

SUFI: Yes, very strongly. These institutions, most of them are, in fact, insolvent. I don't believe it at all for a second that this is still a liquidity crisis.

CONAWAY: All right. We also talked to Russ Roberts. He's a George Mason University economist. He also runs the "EconTalk" podcast, which is award-winning.

DAVIDSON: Yes, I got to say that I was listening to the "EconTalk" podcast this week, and I said I want to have an opportunity to say on our podcast what I love about Russ Roberts' podcast. And it is this - Russ Roberts is an economist, but in his podcast, he's really struggling to figure stuff out. Unlike many economists - not all, but many - he's willing to admit that he doesn't understand a lot when he doesn't understand. I mean, obviously, Russ does understand plenty of things, but - and he's willing to be very clear about that. So that being said, one thing he doesn't need to figure out is what he thinks about much of what the Obama administration is doing. He doesn't like it. He hates the stimulus package. He doesn't like the bank bailouts. He really believes let the market sort it out. Let the banks fail.

CONAWAY: Yeah, let them fail. He also did not like listening to Geithner swerving around your questions, Adam. But Russ Roberts keyed in on a couple of parts, including this.

GEITHNER: The government has to take risks that the private market cannot take at this time. And that is a necessary thing to do, because if we don't do that, then we're going to see much more damage to businesses and families across the country.

CONAWAY: And here's what Roberts thought when he heard that.

RUSS ROBERTS: Well, we're not going to have a recovery until the private sector takes risks. It's always easy for the government to take risk because they're taking risks with other people's money.

CONAWAY: He's saying that the government has to be the player at the table. The government has to roll the dice.

ROBERTS: And with the justification - the justification is if we don't do that, it's going to be so much worse. And the right question is, how do you know? You're rolling the dice with my money, claiming it's for my own good, you're going to save me money in the long run? What's the evidence for that? Why am I not worried that you're going to make the wrong kind of investments with my money because you don't have the right incentives to take care with my money? I really don't find that comforting at all.

DAVIDSON: So we're going to turn to Simon Johnson, who you do hear an awful lot of on this podcast because, well, we do like Simon a lot. And he started this whole Geithner analysis by blogging his reactions on his own blog, baselinescenario.com.

CONAWAY: Justin goes straight to this exchange right here.

GEITHNER: I am confident that that broad strategy would be - would cause more damage to the economy and the financial system.

DAVIDSON: The nationalization strategy?

GEITHNER: That broad strategy would. People mean different things by it. But what many people mean - would be more damaging to the process - to the cause of getting the financial system working again more quickly and supporting the kind of flow of credit necessary for recovery.

CONAWAY: Now, Simon Johnson gives Geithner big points for managing not to say the word nationalization. Simon Johnson is a former chief economist of the IMF. He has been prepped himself for this kind of interview. He said Geithner does an Olympic-level job of avoiding a hot question, he calls it. But he also says Geithner got his message across - no nationalization.

SIMON JOHNSON: To me, this was the real clear clincher that the temporary nationalization, FDIC-type takeover of major banks is not imminent, not foreseen. And actually, funny enough, before they run the stress test, they've decided that this is the case. So I'm not quite sure the purpose of these stress tests, but they have it.

DAVIDSON: Now, we're hoping to talk more on some upcoming podcasts about those stress tests. We're going to dig into them. Many, many, many economists say the tests are, let's just say, not stressful enough. I also want to say we're getting deep into this on the This American - I don't mean to be so self-promotional, but I just spent a lot of time on it.

CONAWAY: Yeah, you've been working hard on this.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

CONAWAY: No, this is a big deal for us.

DAVIDSON: We get into this. You'll hear Simon Johnson. Anyway, a lot in the This American Life story.

CONAWAY: All right. Back in February, we got an email - came through with the subject line, Please hear me - all caps, lots of exclamation points.

DAVIDSON: That email was from Celeste Lewis. She's an architect in Portland, Ore., who specializes in residential remodeling.

CONAWAY: And in her letter, Celeste told us that as confidence in the economy has faltered, so has her business. She says potential clients who want to remodel without a loan were feeling less and less secure. They don't want to lay out the cash.

DAVIDSON: And then two weeks later, we got another email from Celeste saying things had gotten much worse. So PLANET MONEY's own Caitlin Kenney called her up to find out what happened.

CELESTE LEWIS: On a typical January, I might - or in February - might, you know, have as many as nine to 12 inquiries for new work. And not every inquiry leads to an interview, and then typically that leads to about - you know, two-thirds of those or half of those, you know, kind of become interviews. And then I'd say another half of those become new jobs for the year, which is generally between two and four new jobs per year. And I started to see a decline last year in my inquiries for new work, but I was very busy with work I had already taken on from 2007, so I kind of didn't think about it much. And those inquiries have really dropped off dramatically since September. And this year at - in January I was called three times, none of which actually capitalized on an interview.

CAITLIN KENNEY, BYLINE: So one of the other things that you mentioned in your letter is that - talking about laying off your employees.

LEWIS: Yes.

KENNEY: So how many people did you start with, and, you know, what are you looking at for staff now?

LEWIS: I had two last year, and, you know, I let one go in the summer, and then, you know, I have one very wonderful person working for me right now. And we - you know, we kind of both saw the work kind of declining. And in November, she agreed to, you know, work on a reduced hours. And then in January, when - you know, late January when it looked like I was not going to get any work or potentially not get any work, you know, especially - I waited until after the inauguration to kind of make this call - I, you know, started in discussions with her quite openly that, you know, there wasn't a lot of work around. We'd already kind of neatened up the office. We've compressed our space. We've done a lot of things, you know, that we needed to do to kind of get our housekeeping in order after you've been busy, but that really - you know, if something didn't break that there would be no work. And we've just had a very open discussion that's - you know, every week we've reviewed the situation, reviewed the amount of work, what we're doing, and each week we've agreed to continue on until the next week. And we've been doing that for about four or five weeks at this point. And, you know, I'm kind of coming down to the end. I still hold hope that, you know, next week someone will call me. I mean, I'm really, like, a phone call away from canceling the doom and gloom, but I'm also, you know, a meeting away from deciding, well, this is the end.

CONAWAY: You know, Adam, we see these projections from economists about how long this recession is likely to last, and people like Fed Chairman Bernanke saying, well, we could start to see recovery in 2010. That's a long ways away if you're watching a business wither.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, it means thousands of businesses, one can assume - maybe hundreds of thousands - will not last.

CONAWAY: Yeah, it's just too far away for them. Keep sending us your PLANET MONEY indicators, please. You can email them to us at planetmoney@npr.org or post them to our Facebook page. We'll link to it from our blog, npr.org/money.

DAVIDSON: OK, and we're almost done for today. But, Laura, this is the thing I didn't want to have to do. We have to say goodbye to Kadi Simon (ph), who has been our wonderful project manager. She's leaving us to go back to her private consulting business. And I got to say, you remember before Kadi came on board how I was sort of the project manager?

CONAWAY: Yes, I do remember that.

DAVIDSON: And I think it's fair to say I'm not a very good project manager.

CONAWAY: Oh, now, you're lovable.

DAVIDSON: We were having fights.

CONAWAY: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: We were exhausted - more exhausted than we are now. We were - things were falling through the cracks, and Kadi came and really just made it happen, made it work. And we're really going to miss her.

CONAWAY: Yeah, we're going to miss you a lot, Kadi. Good luck. Godspeed. You're the best.

DAVIDSON: And if I can indulge, since Kadi and I speak Hebrew, (speaking Hebrew). So listen. This week for the PLANET MONEY special on Chicago Public Radio's This American Life...

CONAWAY: Featuring the immortal words of Caitlin Kenney, but my baby, my baby, where will my baby sleep?

DAVIDSON: And we'll see you on Monday. I'm Laura Conaway.

CONAWAY: And I'm Adam Davidson. Where is Kadi Simon? Thanks for listening.

We're gonna talk about one of the ways for fixing a bank or maybe a way that one person doesn't want to see us fix
The banks and we're also gonna hear from economists about your interview Adam
One of the things that happened to you this week was you talked to Tim Geithner? Yeah, the Treasury Secretary
Let's get to that in a minute. But first there is a lot of news today on Friday
We've heard about this all week, but Citigroup does seem to have a new deal with Treasury the government
You may remember gave them 45 billion dollars in exchange for preferred stock in Citigroup
Now Citigroup, they're not getting new money. What they're doing is they're converting 25 billion of that 45 billion
From preferred stock to common stock. That's roughly 25. The government says they want to
Go have these basically that they want Citigroup to find someone else. Yeah
So so this means that the government could end up owning a far more significant share of the company more than a third of it
but crucially this was carefully carefully designed to prevent the US government from owning a majority of
Citigroup and becoming its primary owner
But this does mean that the government will have voting rights that they'll be able to kick people off the board
It seems like and have a lot of influence over how Citigroup is run even more than they do already
Okay, but none of those numbers in the Citigroup deal are the ones that especially shocked us today
No, because there was one number that they really yeah this shocked us. This was
This was our planet money indicator
6.2%
Which is how much the US economy shrunk by if you did it on an annualized basis using seasonally adjusted data
For the last three months of 2008
Yeah, and that number is actually revised down from an earlier figure for gross domestic product
Which is of course is the sum total of everything bought and sold and paid and earned
The government originally said that GDP had been shrinking at three point eight percent, which is pretty bad
I mean a healthy economy a healthy US economy should be growing at two and a half three percent a year. So
Shrinking at any rate is bad, but shrinking at three point eight percent is bad
Economists were very pessimistic. They said I think that three percent three point eight percent number is a little low
We think the economy really shrunk at an annual rate of five point four percent
Yeah
But this thing this when they go back and tote it all up again and put in the final numbers and comes out six point
Two percent that is the worst shrinkage in a quarter century. Yeah, I get so tired
I got to be honest of every week having to read numbers and say and that's the worst in 20 years 30 years 50
But there it is. It's we're reporting the facts. So at the end of the show
We're gonna have a Main Street indicator for you from someone whose work has like the US economy been shrinking a fair amount
So Adam in the middle of all this work you've been doing you've had a couple of really interesting phone calls
One of them was with this guy William Isaac. Yeah, he he calls himself bill
He tells everyone to call him bill. He ran the FDIC back in the early 1980s
And I talked to him a lot about bank
Nationalization because as the former head of the FDIC, he has a unique perspective on this issue. So what does he think?
All right. Basically, he says he personally and uniquely has been down this nationalization road before and he says it's in his view
It's a bad idea
if you define nationalization
the proper way, which is the government seizes control of the ownership and
management of a company
In this case a bank as far as I know I am the only person
Who has ever nationalized a bank in the United States?
What happens when you take over a bank when you nationalize a bank?
What how many people are involved? How many people at the FDIC working for you were involved? Oh
I
Don't know how many but it probably was
At least a hundred or two hundred people were involved and and what are they doing?
I mean, you you don't you don't suddenly have a guy from the FDIC working the the
The teller window right or you know, you're stocking the coffee in the lobby or whatever
What what what do you do? What do you eliminate positions and take them over?
Is there actual government officials in the bank? How does it work? What's well what we did back then was to try to
do it in a in a way in which we had as little involvement as we could as we could have and
One thing we did was we hired
you know, we bought about I think it was about five billion dollars of problem loans from Continental and
We we had a discount and we hired Continental to manage those problem loans
For us and and collect them and and service them and the like
um
We gave them guide what we gave them an incentive arrangement. So they had every reason to make the collections
Properly and then we also gave them
guidance on on
What they had authority to do and what they needed approval from us to do and then we had a team of people lawyers and and
business people from the FDIC who oversaw that that collections and servicing process by Continental
So that's probably where most of the people that would have been involved. We also
Removed oh, I don't know. I think it was about two-thirds of Continental's board and
and
required the bank to
Nominate new directors and subject to FDIC approval
we eliminated
some of the top management and we
We hired new people to come in and run Continental so it's kind of like if Warren Buffett had bought the bank he might
Have said it. Well, I I've now have the vast majority of shares
I'd like to get rid of a bunch of bored people. I don't like the management
It's not that terribly different, right?
Yeah
and and the other thing is though that the other things were pretty harsh because we said
We said give us a business plan for shrinking this bank by 50% was in the next three years
Which is not what Warren he would not do that
he would say give me a business plan for making it twice as big as it is in the next three years or
something like that and
So our our objective was to shrink this thing down and have it be less risky and we also required
we had we had the right to
Approve hiring and firing decisions and compensation for senior people
And we also required our approval if they were going to undertake any new business activities or increase the risks in any way in the bank
Yeah, I wanted to go through what what were they allowed to do on their own without calling you guys and what what?
When did they have to call you like with the new CEO be on the phone with the FDIC every every couple hours
Do you think or was it once a week? They had a
They knew what the rules were and that is if they wanted to make some major investments and
Anything day-to-day we didn't get involved in but if they wanted to deal with hiring and firing the top
I don't know how many people was let's say 20 or 30 people
And the cop and safe knows those people they they needed to clear that through us
And if they were going to undertake any kind of a new business
Initiative of consequence they needed to come to us, but no they didn't they didn't call us every day
And but it's kind of weird. It's
They're no longer running it
Like any private business to grow and make a steady profit, right? They were running it
They had this other and other goal to to to shrink I mean, it's hard to find a business whose goal is to shrink
No, that's exactly right. And that's one of the things that I wrote in the Wall Street Journal
I don't see how you do it without destroying our economy
Continental held
Just under 2% of the banking assets in the United States the three or four largest banks today
Have somewhere around 50% of the banking assets if we were to try to nationalize them
They are going to shrink significantly
Partly because of the FDIC or the regulators generally will want them to shrink
So that they can reduce the risk
It would it would be unacceptable for them to take on new risks and big new losses while they were while they were owned by
the FDIC and
And and but even if they didn't want them to shrink they would shrink because the marketplace would run away from them
And so yeah, let me understand that so so because I got to say so far
You've made me feel like well nationalization isn't that big a deal you get you get a hundred
Technocrats to sort of oversee some details. You get some, you know respected gray beards in there and
And you give them some clear instructions and and and that's that
Why can't we just do that for Citibank and Bank of America? And if you were to do that today
You're talking about
incapacitating essentially half the banking system
I mean if you if you were to nationalize, let's say the top four banks, and I don't believe we can stop at one
Some people think well, why don't we just do it with this one?
Well, I I believe that the that the marketplace would would take several of them down
They you mean if you do Citibank and Bank of America shareholders and bondholders will freak out and
Run away and then basically Bank of America collapses and you have to take them over
With without without using the names because I don't like to talk about specific banks
but but I believe that if you if you were to take down one of the big banks that that
then the short sellers and
Speculators would attack the next one and once they got that one
Stocked down to a penny or whatever. They'd come after and it got nationalized. They'd come after the next one. I
This marketplace has been brutal
Is there a manpower constraint here? I mean you you had a hundred people to
Nationalize and I know we're talking rough numbers here
But roughly a hundred people to nationalize a forty billion dollar bank
Is it is it sort of equivalent to two trillion dollar bank, which is I'm just doing the math in my head
Ten a hundred like fifty times bigger. So
Would it need five thousand people or does it not quite work that way?
No, it
It probably does work that way
You'd need a lot of people and these banks are also so
They're so much more complex today
And they're spread out all over the globe
That all was pretty plain vanilla by today's standards
It didn't have bizarre securitized assets that
Maybe even the lawyer who invented them doesn't understand them completely and you know
The other we haven't gotten to the other part of it, which is
One should do nationalize. Let's say several of these banks. What are you going to do with them?
In the case of continental
The FGIC didn't wasn't able to divest it for seven years. It was seven years before it got rid of its
All of its interest in continental and why is that just think you couldn't find a buyer who wanted a piece of it
You couldn't make a deal
Well, I mean I I had I left the FDIC within probably a year or so after
Taking over continental so I can't
really talk about
With firsthand knowledge as to why they took as long as they did to get rid of it
I know they I think well the strategy they took was they started unloading parts of it
in public offerings and the market can only digest so much at once and
So they I think they did my memory is they did several public offerings until they got it public
entirely and then
And then about three years after it was the FDIC got out Bank of America bought it
So it didn't it didn't stick it didn't it what it never did become a viable competitor again
So
But anyway, let's say we have let's say we have three or four of these banks nationalize
they control fifty percent of the banking system and they
You know before nationalization there
They total maybe eight trillion dollars in size
Yeah, we're
Who you gonna sell them to I don't know how you do a public offering that big or series of public offerings that big
Since you're selling the only companies big enough to buy right themselves and and
You can't sell to foreign interests
You can't we're never going to accept a foreign power having that kind of control over our economy
So you can just take all that foreign money or most of it off the table
it can be part of a deal, but it can't be a
major part of a deal or it's not going to pass muster
Adam will link to that Bill Isaac's piece in the Wall Street Journal when we post the podcast today
It's it'll be on the blog at NPR org slash money for you out there
And you Adam had yet another call that this one made a really big splash right here at Planet Money World headquarters
Yeah, that was when we got a call from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's office saying he would give us an interview
And I'll be honest I did I asked for a lower-level staffer. I even said it off the record is fine
I just want to go over some details and then they say well, do you want to talk to the man himself?
So we posted the whole thing the whole conversation on the podcast
Wednesday and listeners ever since you guys have just been all over the map about it, right?
I mean Geithner clearly, you know, let's be fair. He stayed very much on message and
a lot of people myself included were trying to read through and trying to figure out what what was the substance that he
was saying because there was a lot of
I
Talking points. Yeah, it was it was straight talking points
Yeah
but personally I did think that he said some things that had substance to them and
In any event we wanted to see what economists might say because you know
They live in a different world and they might hear what he was saying differently, right?
So one guy we thought of right away was Omar Sufi who teaches at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business
He says of course Geithner stayed on message
He is in many ways the most influential man in the world right now if he orders the wrong thing for lunch
It could cause a bank run. Yeah, and Geithner had to speak very very carefully
But there is this one part Adam where Omar Sufi says he thinks that Tim Geithner tipped his hand
And I have to say this part is mostly you Adam
You're talking about a dollhouse that was bought with a mortgage for a hundred bucks, right?
This is a metaphor that we use on the podcast before to explain how banks work
And it's something that will play a big role in our this American life show and it and it's something I talked to the
Treasury secretary about so in my stylized
Example if I can see if I can paraphrase you you're saying
The market thinks that house is worth $50 not because the house isn't worth that much
But because people aren't buying dollhouses because because they can't get the financing
We feel confident that six months a year two years from now that house will be closer to its par value
Closer to a hundred so it makes no sense for us to force that bank to collapse under the weight of the deficit
So honestly if you tell me that what he hears in this is
There are two ways you can view the bank crisis. The first is that it's this problem of insolvency
Meaning that some of the big banks are really truly broke and there is no reason to keep pouring taxpayer money into them
Right, the government should just take them over if you believe that but and then sell them to someone else
But but the other argument is that we don't have an insolvency problem. We just have a liquidity problem
That's a fancy way to say that the banks have all these toxic assets
But they're really worth something more than people are willing to pay now
But people just don't have the money to pay so they're not paying for it right now
But if the government can just kind of help the banks muddle through a while
The situation will stabilize the banks will be healthy again all will be well
So when Geithner says to Adam that's very well said Amar Sufi here's liquidity crisis
You never know what these guys actually believe right because they can't say what they actually believe
but he did a pretty convincing job that he really does believe that this is just a liquidity problem and
Therefore the role of the government is to inject equity to get these banks through this liquidity crisis
With the view that look you don't want to come in and restructure or force these guys into chapter 11 or nationalize
Because they're not insolvent. They're perfectly solvent. They just need to get through these rough patches
Do you yourself come down on one side of the debate or the yeah very strongly these institutions?
Most of them are in fact insolvent. I I don't believe it at all for a second that this is still liquidity crisis
All right. We also talked to Russ Roberts. He's a George Mason University economist
He also runs the econ talk podcast which is award-winning
Yes, I gotta say that I was listening to the contact podcast this week
And I said I want to have an opportunity to say on our podcast what I love about Russ Roberts
Podcast and it is this Russ Roberts is an economist, but in his podcast. He's really
Struggling to figure stuff out
Unlike many economists not all but many he's willing to admit that he doesn't understand a lot
When he doesn't understand, I mean obviously rest doesn't understand plenty of things but
And he's willing to be very clear about that. So that that being said
One thing he doesn't need to figure out is what he thinks about much of what the Obama administration is doing
He doesn't like it. He hates the stimulus package. He doesn't like the bank bailouts
He really believes let the market sort it out. Let the banks fail. Yeah, let him fail
He also did not like listening to Geithner swerving around your questions at him
But Russ Roberts keyed in on a couple of parts including this the government has to take risks that the private market cannot take at
This time and that is a necessary thing to do because if we don't do that
Then we're gonna see much more damage to businesses and families across the country
And here's what Roberts thought when he heard that well
We're not gonna have a recovery until the private sector takes risks
It's always easy for the government to take risks because they're taking risks with other people's money
He's saying that the government has to be the player at the table the government has to roll the dice and with the justification
The justification is if we don't do that. It's going to be so much worse and the right question is how do you know?
You're on it. You're on the dice with my money
Claiming it's for my own good. You're gonna save me money in the long run. What's the evidence for that?
Why am I not worried that you're going to make the wrong kind of investments with my money?
Because you don't have the right incentives to take care with my money
I really don't find that comforting at all
So we're gonna turn to Simon Johnson who you do hear an awful lot of on this podcast because well
We do like Simon a lot and he started this whole Geithner analysis by blogging his reactions on his own blog
Baseline scenario comm Johnson goes straight to this exchange right here. I am confident that
That broad strategy would be would cause more damage to the economy and the financial system the nationalization strategy
That broad strategy would people mean different things by it
but what many people means would be more damaging to the process to the cause of
getting the financial system working again more quickly and
Supporting the kind of flow of credit necessary for recovery now Simon Johnson gives Geithner big points for managing not to say the word
Nationalization Simon Johnson is a former chief economist of the IMF. He has been prepped himself for this kind of interview
He said Geithner does an Olympic level job of avoiding a hot question
He calls it but he also says Geithner guide his message across no
Nationalization to me. This was the the real
Clear clincher that the temporary nationalization FGIC type takeover of major banks
Is is not imminent not foreseen and actually funny enough before they run the stress test
They've decided that this is this is the case. So I'm not quite sure the purpose of these stress tests
But there you have it
Now we're hoping to talk more on on some upcoming podcasts about those stress tests
We're gonna dig into them many many many economists say the tests are let's just say not stressful enough
I also want to say we're getting deep into this on that this American life
I don't seem mean to be so self-promotional, but I just spent a lot of time
We get into this you'll hear Simon Johnson. Anyway a lot in the this American life story. All right back in February
We got an email
Came through with the subject line. Please hear me all caps lots of exclamation points. That email was from Celeste Lewis
She's an architect in Portland, Oregon who specializes in
Residential remodeling and in her letter Celeste told us that as confidence in the economy has faltered
So has her business she says potential clients who want to remodel without a loan. We're feeling less and less secure
They don't want to lay out the cash and then two weeks later
We got another email from Celeste saying things had gotten much worse
So Planet Money's own Caitlin Kenny called her up to find out what happened
on a typical
January I might in February might you know have as many as
9 to 12 inquiries for new work and and not every inquiry leads to an interview and then typically that leads to about
You know two-thirds of those or half of those, you know
Become interviews and then I'd say another half of those become new new jobs for the year
which is generally between two and four new jobs per year and I
Started I'd started to see a decline last year in my inquiries for new work, but I was very busy with work
I had already taken on from 2007
so I kind of didn't think about it much and
Those inquiries have really dropped off dramatically since September and this year at in January
I was called three times none of which actually capitalized on an interview
So one of the other things that you mentioned in your letter is that talking about laying off your employees? Yes
So how many people do you start with and you know, what are you looking at for a staff now?
I had two last year and you know, I let one go in the summer and then you know have one
Very wonderful person working for me right now and we you know
We kind of both saw the work kind of declining and in November she agreed to work, you know work on a reduced
Reduced hours and then in January when you know late January when it when it looked like I was not going to get any
Work or potentially not get any work
You know, you know, especially I waited until after the inauguration to kind of make this call. I
You know started in discussions with her quite openly that
You know that there, you know, there wasn't a lot of work around we'd already kind of neatened up the office
We've compressed our space
We've done a lot of things, you know that we needed to do to kind of get our housekeeping in order after you've been busy
But that really you know
If something didn't break that there would be no work and we've just had a very open discussion that you know every week
We've reviewed the situation review the amount of work what we're doing and and each week we've agreed to
continue on until the next week and we've been doing that for about four or five weeks at this point and
You know, I'm kind of coming down to the end
I I still hold hope that you know next week someone will call me
I mean, I'm really like a phone call away from
Canceling the doom and gloom, but I'm also you know a meeting away from
Deciding well, this is the end
You know Adam we see these projections from economists about how long this recession is likely at last and people like Fed Chairman
Bernanke saying well, we could start to see recovery in 2010
That's a long ways away if you're watching a business with her. Yeah, it means
Thousands of businesses one can assume maybe hundreds of thousands will will not last. Yeah, it's just too far away for them
Keep sending us your planet money indicators, please
You can email them to us at planet money at NPR dot org or post them to our Facebook page
We'll link to it from our blog NPR dot org slash money. Okay, and we're almost done for today
But Laura, this is this is the thing I didn't want to have to do
We have to say goodbye to
Cotty Simon who has been our wonderful project manager
she's leaving us to go back to her private consulting business and
I got to say you remember before Cotty came on board how I
Was sort of the project manager
I'm not a very good project manager. Oh now you're lovable
We were having fights. Yeah, we were exhausted more exhausted than we are now
We were things were falling through the cracks and Cotty came and really just made it happen made it work
And we're really gonna miss her. Yeah, we're gonna miss you a lot Cotty. Good luck. Godspeed
You're the best and if I can indulge since Cotty and I
Speak Hebrew
So listen this week for the planet money special on Chicago Public Radio's this American life featuring the immortal words of Caitlin Kinney
And we'll see you on Monday, I'm Laura Conaway and I'm madam Davidson, where is Cotty Simon? Thanks for listening
You
