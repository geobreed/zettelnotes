Today on Planet Money:

-- With more than $800 billion in federal spending on tap, Selectman Erik Filkorn says people in his Vermont town are hoping at least some of the economic stimulus money would help rebuild their roads and bridges. Filkorn himself isn't counting on it.

-- On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is expected to unveil the government's latest plan for helping troubled banks. Early reports say it's something of a public/private partnership. Economist Adam Posen of the Peterson Institute says the big problem is that American leaders still aren't flexing enough muscle.

Bonus: A note from the U.K., after the jump.

Dan McNamee, who sent the photo for today's podcast, writes from London:

    I took this photo on the way back to the office from a meeting in London. The situation here is pretty grim and the general outlook of the people here is quite negative.

    I work as an attorney in London focusing on large financial transactions (IPOs and high yield debt). Or, at least I did. Life has definitely changed with all the bank layoffs and with layoffs at other law firms. Young bankers fleeing back to their home country as bonuses shrink along with the pound and job opportunities.

**(Laura Conaway):**

An endless delay or paralysis in Washington in the face of this crisis will only bring
deepening disaster.
I can tell you that doing nothing is not an option.
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money in Washington, D.C.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And in New York, I'm Laura Conaway.
This is Monday, February 9th, and boy is it a big week for economic news.
Today we're going to talk about the $800 billion plus economic stimulus package that's
in the Senate right now, and also about the government's new plan for saving banks.
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is supposed to unveil that tomorrow on Tuesday.
I hope to go to it.
For now, I want to do our planet money indicator.
Go for it, David.
It is 0.1 to 0.3 percent.
The numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office.
Yeah, the office says that's how much this big economic stimulus package will ultimately
shrink the economy.
Yes, shrink the economy.
That is for the year 2019.
Basically the idea is that the government is going to be borrowing so much money
to pay for the stimulus that it's going to crowd out private investments.
So basically too many people put money into buying treasury bonds, and there's
not enough left over for private investment.
I should point out that in the short run it says you do get this bump in GDP, and by
the end of 2010 you'd have something like, it says 1.3 million to 3.9 million new jobs.
But then when you go way out into the future, there is some drag on the economy.
Yeah, I talked briefly to one economist today, this guy, Amir Sufi.
I'm hoping to get a little more from him tomorrow.
He was saying that actually if you just run the strict economic models, the numbers
might be worse than what the CBO is saying.
A bunch of listeners sent over that blog item, and we'll be following it up on
npr.org slash money.
As we said a minute ago, the Senate is considering Barack Obama's request for
this major stimulus package, and they might vote on ending debate as early as
today.
And then we're talking about a whole lot of debate.
A whole lot, and not just on Capitol Hill.
We got this email from Eric Filcorn.
He lives in a small town in Vermont called Richmond.
According to the town's website, they have about 4,090 residents, tiny.
So Eric wrote to us saying that the idea of the stimulus package was causing
people up there to behave slightly strangely.
Yeah, Eric serves as a town selectman, which means his phone rings a lot.
And he told our colleague Caitlin Kinney that lately he feels like
everyone he talks to has been kind of hypnotized by the promise of the check.
I'm involved in the business community, and I'm involved in civil government.
And on both sides, I keep getting involved in conversations where somewhere
at some point in the conversation, someone will say, but when the stimulus
comes, everything will be different.
Or we shouldn't do that yet, because it might qualify for the stimulus.
We even have a bridge project going on in town.
They're about to close our bridge for six months.
And the state accelerated the process in an amazing, ridiculous way.
They're going to be working on it 24-7.
But at some point, they had been going forward with the project going,
we'll work out where we find the money.
We just know this is an important project that needs to get done.
And when the stimulus package has started to take shape,
suddenly words started coming down, well, we may delay the project just
in case we can get stimulus money for it.
So I'm seeing things that were locked and loaded suddenly starting
to tread water a little bit.
As it turns out, we've worked it out so that the project can stay on track
and still be eligible.
But I'm also hearing from people in the business community,
because I work around renewable energy and stuff, business organizations
saying, well, everything will be different in the springtime
when the stimulus comes.
And I always stop in the meeting and go,
you don't know what's coming out of the Senate.
You can't count on that.
You've got to keep working.
So why do you think you're a little bit more skeptical
than some of these people who seem so excited about when
the stimulus comes?
I probably hang out with too many reporters.
I think because I work in PR, I work with a lot
of different kinds of businesses.
And also serving in government, I see it
from a bunch of different angles in a very small space.
The latest round of job losses is about equivalent
to the population of Vermont.
So you get a real slice of society with a small group of people.
That was Eric Filcorn with Caitlin Kenney.
The other big news this week is the government's latest strategy
for rescuing the banks.
It seems to keep changing.
This one we're going to be hearing more about tomorrow.
There's some inkling of what it is.
And basically, it's looking like some sort
of public-private partnership.
The idea is the government would somehow
entice private investors to buy up or help buy up
some of the toxic assets.
Yeah, and the question is, if people
don't want to buy them already,
how do you get them to buy them later?
And we're talking about these mortgage-backed securities,
these collateralized debt obligations.
It's all this general gunk that nobody so far
has wanted to buy.
Right.
It's unclear how this thing is
going to work at this point.
The general idea seems to be that the government wouldn't
have to buy it all.
Private investors would go in on it,
and they'd share some of the losses if things went bad,
but also share some of the gains.
And I think the main question is going to be,
how do you divide those things?
You don't want the taxpayers holding all the risk
and not getting any of the benefit.
Yeah, especially if I'm one of the taxpayers.
I don't think that sounds like a great deal.
A few days back, our colleague Adam Davidson
saw something about the current situation on Facebook,
and it was the status update from an economist named Adam
Posen, who works with the Peterson Institute.
He said, Adam, meaning Posen, is very happy the Obama team
and democratic leadership are moving
on big public stimulus, a little less happy about the two
wimpy financial reforms.
You don't see that kind of status update very often
on Facebook.
No, you don't.
And we just couldn't resist.
Adam Davidson and I called Adam Posen
to ask him what he meant by that two
wimpy financial reforms bit.
Well, it's good you didn't read the previous status,
Adam, which was about my visit to Burns Steakhouse
in Tampa.
The two wimpy financial reforms are,
we're in a very dangerous place right now.
The banks are in a halfway house
between being private and public, at least
the big money center banks.
And wait, wait, wait.
We're anti-jargon here on Planet Money.
Money Center Bank, I was like, what does that mean?
What does that mean?
It's just a big bank that you've heard of, Citibank,
JP Morgan Chase.
It's a big bank you've heard of that has lots of people
you're doing transactions with.
That's why it's the center.
It's at, talk about social networking,
it's at the center of a cluster of transactions.
That's what makes it a money center bank.
And generally in New York or London?
Yeah, although nowadays there were ones headquartered
in Charlotte in the US and there
are ones on the West Coast.
But generally it's New York, London, Tokyo, Singapore,
Frankfurt.
OK, so big, big, big banks.
The big, big, big banks are all in this funny halfway
house where they're guaranteed a lot of stuff
by the US government or the Federal Reserve.
They have got US government stakes in them,
which may or may not strictly translate
into ownership stakes.
But at the same time, they've got private shareholders,
they've got private managers who
are very eager to hold onto their jobs and their budgets
for spending on carpets in their offices.
And bonuses.
And bonuses and all the rest of it.
And you've got them trying to make a profit.
And this kind of financial hybrid situation doesn't work.
I mean, we saw this with Fannie and Freddie,
which were the most egregious examples.
They were busy trying to supposedly serve
a public interest while also make
profits for the shareholders.
And you should define which it's going to be.
In some cases, making profits for your shareholders
is the public interest, in which case
the government shouldn't be there.
And in some cases, the government interest
has to trump, in which case the profit motive
shouldn't be there.
But this mixed stuff tends to be very dangerous.
And that's where we are with a large part
of the US banking system right now.
So what would the government getting tough on the banks
look like?
The government getting tough on the banks
would look like things we saw the US government do
in the mid-'80s with the savings and loan crisis.
We saw the Swedish government do with their banks
they had a terrible crisis in the early 90s.
And the Japanese finally got around
to doing with their banks in around 2001.
Tough means you send in government officials.
And there's plenty of unemployed bank examiners
we can make into government officials right now.
You go through the books and you say,
90% of this is worth nothing.
We're going to pay you.
These are all the toxic assets.
Toxic assets, loans that are impaired,
meaning people are behind on paying them,
stuff that is illiquid,
meaning people don't know how to value it,
mortgages that are in foreclosure,
all of which probably has some worth,
but they don't have any worth right now.
And so you say to the banks,
well, this is really all you have left
when we pay you what they're worth right now.
And the bank says, then I don't have anything left.
And you say, too bad.
And then all the managers are shown the door
and all the shareholders are shown the door
and it's bankrupt.
And we have a very special procedure
for how to handle a bankrupt bank.
And then you take all these toxic assets
and the US government basically pays
what's left of the bank,
a discounted value of those assets
and then tries to sell them.
I thought everything that the Treasury Department
and the Fed are doing
is trying to keep these banks alive.
And you're saying what they should do is kill them.
I'm saying that you should kill their ownership
and their management.
Kill, I don't mean personally.
Although some of them make you want
to actually kill them.
But I want to be clear,
I'm not threatening any violence here,
just financial move.
You want, at the end of the day,
to have a banking system
that does do what it traditionally does,
which is make loans on good candidates
and speculate modest way.
Pursues profit in a constructive way.
And you can't get from the first to the second
without shutting them down in Las Vegas.
You have to get them out of the casino,
sober them up a bit,
retrain them and put them back out into their job.
And the way you do that is you have to shut the banks,
you have to consolidate some banks,
you have to force them to take their losses.
The sad news is if you do that,
that's usually bad for the economy while it's happening.
And this is the trade off that I think the Obama team
and the Congress have not yet really faced up to.
Because it's, I mean, it sounds like a nuclear option.
I hate that phrase,
but I don't know what else to say.
It sounds like, I mean, in the U.S.,
it's nationalization,
it's the government coming in and destroying.
They're not destroying anything.
They are, this is the government coming in
to the federal disaster area at a toxic waste site
instead of not marking it
and letting kids continue to drink from the groundwater.
So you're saying whatever bank,
and I sort of want to mention some banks,
but maybe it's best not to.
Better not to.
But that there are banks today
that are technically open for business.
They technically have value in their stocks,
they have chief management,
but those banks are really dead.
They're really dead because A,
their behavior is as though they're dead
once their capital gets low,
even if it is a little bit above zero.
And B, in practice,
if you really evaluate what they got,
their capital probably is negative.
Paul Krugman had a nice column
in the New York Times talking about this.
He made up a bank called Gotham.
And Gotham Bank.
Gotham being a city.
Yes.
So Gotham Bank.
A New York based city.
Gotham Bank, you know,
on paper has 200 billion left in capital,
but that's in part
because they got 400 billion of these assets
that they're valuing at someday worth 400 billion
when they're really worth 25 billion.
So that if you really do a fair accounting,
these banks don't have anything.
And that was what we saw in Japan.
That was what we saw in the US in the 80s.
You have zombie banks that have no real money left.
They make bad decisions.
They just accumulate more bad debt,
which then we have to clean up later.
So like I said about the toxic waste site,
you know, it's not a question
of the government going in and destroying it.
It's a question of government going in
and stopping it before it continues
to seep out and poison other people.
So why don't they do it?
They don't wanna do it for several reasons.
First is once they cross that barrier,
there's a huge burden on the government's balance sheet
on your and my federal government budget
that until they sell off all these assets,
which we don't know how much they'll get back for,
looks like a lot more debt.
They don't wanna do it because the US in general
doesn't like to admit they're nationalizing anything.
That's why we have all these strange hybrids
like we used to have with Fannie and Freddie
and these quasi-public entities.
In economic terms, it's better to either nationalize
or be private than the quasi,
but that's how the US does it.
But thirdly, and I think the biggest motivation is
there's a huge amount of popular resentment
and fear that we're giving all this money to the banks.
It's not doing us any good, right?
They're not lending, the economy's not growing
as a result of the money we're giving the banks.
And nobody wants to say,
well, actually, that's how it works.
We're gonna have to put more money into the banks
and they're basically gonna have to stop lending
for a little while to clean this up.
Basically, the president and the Congress are in denial?
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah, they're in wishful thinking.
And they're understandably in denial.
But this is why government is tough, right?
Because you're always trying to do multiple things
with one policy.
You're trying to make a green economy
and you're trying to structure for future generations
and you're trying to be bipartisan
and you're trying to loosen people's tax load
and you're trying to float the economy
and you're trying to fix the banking system.
You can't quite do all that at once.
David, I checked in with Adam Posen again today
because I wanted to hear what he thinks
about Geithner's sort of emerging plan for the banks.
And the short answer is it's still not tough enough.
He says he does have some sympathy
for the government's position,
for people like Geithner and Larry Summers
who's advising President Obama,
but not too much sympathy.
I put myself in their shoes.
I mean, they're worried, I think excessively worried,
that during this transitional period,
if you shut down the banks,
the government will be making lending decisions.
Well, for the time being,
all they would do is roll over current lending decisions,
so I'm not sure it's that bad.
But they're worried about that.
They're also worried,
both economically and politically,
that if they really shut down all the banks
that need shutting down and reorganization,
they're gonna be shutting down an enormous amount of assets.
In other words, the federal government,
at least temporarily, will have to put on its books
a whole bunch of money invested in these banks
and hundreds of billions of dollars.
And both economically and politically,
they're scared about that.
They think that'll tip things
in terms of kind of debate
we're seeing over the stimulus now,
in terms of interest rates.
My problem is that the money's gone.
So pretending that we don't want to do that
doesn't do anything.
When you say the money's gone,
you mean the banks have already,
they're holding things that aren't worth anything,
value already drained out.
Exactly.
I mean, so there's all this talk
about what's called mark-to-market,
which is you price things
at the price they're currently at.
And right now it's very difficult to do
because a lot of these assets,
particularly involving mortgages
or fancy kinds of securities of insurance,
are called toxic.
Nobody wants to buy them
because nobody's sure what they're really worth.
And so if you were marking the market,
you mark them at zero or pretty close to that.
And the banks will whine and say,
oh, well, but if you just give us time,
it'll come back someday,
and then it'll be worth something.
You won't have to bail us out.
But the question is,
what do they do while they have that time?
And the answer is usually they get more into debt
and cause more problems.
I'm hearing, quit your whining.
That's what I'm hearing, Adam.
Yeah, absolutely.
And I'm a little unhappy
that this administration doesn't want to force them.
I mean, Summers, Geithner,
many of the leaders
on the economic side of this administration
during the 90s, you know,
walked around Asia when there was a financial crisis there
and basically told their governments to say,
quit your whining, shut them down,
do the right thing.
They were right then.
It's just now they got to apply
the same tough love at home.
Little less fun there.
Exactly.
It's always harder when it's your politicians
who are screaming at you.
Laura, thanks for following up on that.
Folks, we'll be back podcasting on Wednesday.
But you can keep in touch with us
and the news and each other
all week on the blog, npr.org slash money.
I'm Laura Conoway.
Send pictures of the economy.
We need them.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Thanks for listening.
It's the trees of this day
That I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel tragic
People greet me, I'm polite
What's the day?
What's you doing?
How's your mood?
How's that song?
Man it passes right by me
It's behind me
