Lately, we're hearing from economists that they don't much like the nearly $900 billion stimulus bill now before Congress. Kent Smetters of Wharton puts the smackdown on the Congressional Budget Office. Then Steve Fazzari of Washington University calls it a disappointing, if standard, grab bag of programs. Plus: People line up in Times Square for free money from "Bailout Bill."

Today on Planet Money:

-- Hundreds of people lined up for free money in Times Square this week, telling their stories to "Bailout Bill" for a minimum of $50. It's part of a promotion for BailoutBooth.com, a new Web site for our time, or what amounts to an Internet pawn shop, or something.

We keep hearing from economists who say they don't much like the nearly $900 billion stimulus bill now before Congress. Kent Smetters of Wharton says just counting the money involved must have been mind-boggling. Then Steve Fazzari of Washington University calls it a disappointing, if standard, grab bag of programs. Your turn's in the comments.

Bonus: An indicator from an MBA student, after the jump.

Matthew Merritt writes that his Planet Money indicator is:

    4 - The amount of volunteer positions at the peace corp that our MBA career advisor sent out as "Job Opportunities."
