    I live in Seattle, WA and there was a Psychic that rented a place across the street from my apartment. They became behind in their rent, so their landlord evicted them and he is now he is selling their items for help pay some of the back rent.

    I wonder if they saw it coming?

**faster whisper:**
I think we've already demonstrated the capacity of our two countries to work together on the
global stage to lay a foundation for economic recovery.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson, overlooking historic Bryant Park in central Manhattan.
You are not.
You're in a windowless studio.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Today is Wednesday, June 3rd.
That was Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner speaking during his meeting this week with Chinese
President Hu Jintao up at the top of the podcast there.
On today's show, we're going to prove something that a lot of people already think is absolutely
true.
But we are going to do it with evidence, with actual numbers, and a live, living
academic economist.
Here's what we're going to prove, or at least give a theory that this guy has
that he thinks proves that people who work on Wall Street, wait for it, make too much
money.
They're overpaid.
First, a Planet Money indicator.
Today it is $21,000.
This is not lunch for a Wall Street banker.
This actually comes from Spain.
It is the going rate.
It's actually the lower end of the going rate for an organ, not a Wurlitzer organ,
a kidney, a lung, for sale online.
I think this is against the law in America, but apparently you can do this in Spain.
Our intern, Matthew Katz, welcome, Matt, posted about it on our blog.
The unemployment rate throughout the European Union hit a 10-year high this week.
In Spain, they are seeing a rise in people advertising organs to sell to patients needing
transplants.
I'm actually not sure it's legal, but Spanish unemployment is up over 17 percent,
and it's still climbing.
People think it has several points to go.
It's the highest in the European Union, and, you know, people start looking for ways to
make money.
All right.
Speaking of money, Laura, you and I both live in New York, and we both work for
public radio.
So we both had the experience.
You're at a party.
Yep.
You meet someone who works in finance.
They're talking about their vacation.
They're talking about their Hamptons estate.
Their second and third estates.
Their second and third.
I had one of my buddies from high school call me the other day.
I'm meeting all these parents from a kid's school.
Who are these people who have these massive townhouses in the village?
Who are these people who have so much money?
Yeah.
I know.
I hate that.
It is always tough.
You're always like, why then?
I'm smart enough.
I could have gone to Wharton, and I could be doing derivatives of derivatives.
Exactly.
For sure.
Right.
So we've all had this feeling.
I'm sure our listeners have had this feeling, and it's this gut feeling.
I think it's alongside America's sort of free market philosophy, or to the extent that it
has one, there's also this feeling of fairness, and this isn't fair.
Now, when you start learning economics, you learn the theory that, well, no, in
a functioning market, prices find their right place, and you don't think of it
in terms of fairness, but you think of efficiency and productivity, and no, you
just have to trust the market.
This is right.
Everyone on Wall Street should make $120 million, and you should make whatever it is
less.
Public radio people make.
So we talked to, or I talked to, an economist named Ariel Reshef.
He's an economics professor at the University of Virginia, and he said to me, you didn't
take enough economics, if that's what you think, that actually the case where the price
is exactly right is a special case and does not apply to Wall Street.
So he wrote this paper with an NYU professor named Thomas Philippon studying how Wall Street
and financial professionals have been paid over the last century.
It's a fascinating paper that we'll post on the blog.
There's a lot of Greek formulas and stuff, but you can at least read through it enough
to understand.
And Reshef says one way to figure this out is you look at people who did something
else, some other job, maybe they were engineers or whatever, and then they went
and right away made more money.
And how much more money is an important part of the question?
Suppose that in 1998 you were in journalism, in 1999 I observe you once again, now you're
in finance, now you're earning twice as much.
I would argue that that extra money is not because you became all of a sudden smarter.
It's because you joined quote unquote a racket, a very lucrative racket.
But isn't it just natural that some professions make more money?
I mean, I'm trying to think through it.
So if I became a doctor, the reason I would make more money, at least one of
the reasons is to go from who I am now to a doctor, I'd need to get many years
of schooling and I'd have to acquire a whole host of skills and I'd be tested
in a variety of ways.
So it makes sense that I would make more money.
So first of all, you need to clear out of this calculation the effect of time.
So this calculation is going to take into account only people, I'm only going
to take into account observations on people in two consecutive years.
And therefore I take, I'm saying-
So you're avoiding people who went for three years and got an MBA or got a PhD
in structured finance?
Absolutely, those are not switchers for me.
But I have another argument, which is one of the things I think of at working
at NPR is part of my compensation is the money I make and part of the
compensation is I have a really fascinating, really fun, exciting job.
I get to travel around the world.
I get to do a lot of things that I would probably pay money to do.
And so if I added all of that up, maybe I do make twice or three times
what my salary is in some fundamental way.
So first of all, this is probably true and you would like to take into
account all those, what we call in economics, compensating differentials.
If your job is really boring, then you need to be compensated for that, right?
Right, if someone said you have to leave NPR and sit in front of a
computer and look at bond prices all day and do the exact same trade
day after day after day, boy, you'd have to pay me a lot more than twice
my salary for me to switch jobs.
Okay, so this is probably true.
But the question is after you measure this extra wage, what I call the
finance premium in a particular year for a particular set of people, and
then I observe what's happening to that premium over time.
So I'm not saying that there aren't compensating differentials.
I graduated NYU with a PhD in economics and it's not beyond my wildest
imagination to work on Wall Street and I decided not to.
And you probably could have made maybe millions more than you make now,
possibly, certainly hundreds of thousands more.
Well, probably maybe a few hundred thousand more.
But the point is I want to see how that extra bonus from working
into finance evolves over time.
So if you see that that thing has increased and increased
tremendously over the last 15 years, then you're starting to think,
well, it's not just compensating differential, something has changed.
So you will have to do a very, very good job in trying to convince me
that working on Wall Street has become more painful over time.
In fact, if anything, it became more interesting over time.
All right. So the idea here is that Wall Street became sort of this
intellectual playground, I guess, over the last few decades where they
invented all these new fun products like the derivatives and the CDOs
and the CDSs.
Right. So what he's saying is if I feel like, hey, if you want me to
work on Wall Street, you got to pay me a lot more because it's
boring, I might not say that as much as Wall Street gets more
interesting. So the extra I might demand, what he calls this
compensating differential, should shrink over time.
But instead, it's doing the opposite.
It's growing. The bonus you get, the extra you get for
switching from any other career to finance has been growing
dramatically over the last 10, 20 years.
So basically, I should be going to Wall Street.
Obviously. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. He says to understand the ideas that he's trying
to get across, you have to understand that what Wall Street
people get is not what economists call a wage, it's what
economists call a rent.
Rent typically meaning the rent that you would pay for an
apartment, but I don't think that's the kind of rent you
mean. They're not renting their cubes.
Right. Exactly.
So the way an economist says rent is not how the rest of us
say rent. I think we keep discovering that there are lots
of words that economists use very differently from the rest of
us. So if there is some situation which allows you to
make more money than some fully competitive market would allow
you to make, that extra money you get is a rent.
So I immediately think of Time Warner Cable.
OK. They have a monopoly over my area of Brooklyn.
Yep. Yep.
And so they're able to charge more than they would
charge if there was competing cable companies competing for my
business. Now we don't know exactly what those competing
cable companies would would charge, but let's say it was ten
or twenty dollars less than so Time Warner gets the market
rate, whatever that would be, plus the rent, the rent that
they get because they have this monopoly power.
But Wall Street is not a monopoly and you see it all
the time in businesses where somebody can come in and hire
new people and pay them less money and charge the
customers less. You could do this with an investment bank.
You could set up a new investment bank and charge lower fees
and pay your people less money and then people will come
and run to you. Right.
Doesn't the market still come up with the right amount
somehow? Reshef says no.
You know, other people would say yes, but Reshef says no.
That's not right because it banking and finance
is not a monopoly, but it's pretty close to an oligopoly,
which in his view, it's not that different.
So so what he says is what you just described, if that
were true, if it were true that just about anybody who came
up with a new idea could start an investment bank and say,
hey, I'm going to pay my people less and be cheaper and
more competitive, then yes, the market would find the
right price. But he says that's not right because of
something called barrier to entry.
If I want to open an investment bank, that's actually not
so easy. There are a lot of barriers to entry into into
this business of finance. It's not so easy.
There are there are people that open hedge funds.
This is true, but hedge funds are inherently small
operations. Some of them grew bigger.
This is true. But inherently, they're small.
They're often a guy in his living room with a computer
in a Bloomberg terminal.
And then he hires his cousin or his friend from his
trading desk who just got laid off.
Yeah, I was almost in that in that situation in terms of
being hired. So so yeah.
And so there are low, low, low barriers to entry there.
But there are actually very high barriers to entry into
finance. It's not it's not a coincidence that
finance people hire, you know, the best and brightest of,
you know, the top Ivy League schools and the top schools
in the U.S. because they can.
And that means that people that are not coming from that
from that cohort actually don't have access.
So so that's one thing.
So when you have barriers of entry, there is there's
that's the first sign that, you know, there might be
an inefficient outcome.
And so let's let's let's pick a job that is
properly that is an efficient job.
I was a freelance writer and I was hawking my wares.
There's very low barrier to entry.
Pretty much anyone can say they're a freelance writer
and call up magazines and try and offer their services.
The magazines and newspapers I wrote for wanted to pay
me as little as possible.
I wanted them to pay me as much as possible.
And basically, we both had competition.
There were other freelance writers who were willing to
do the job I was willing to do.
And there were other magazines who were willing to hire me.
And and what I noticed is as I did more work, as I got
better at the job, I would make more money because I was
I was valued more highly by those magazines.
Now, of course, those magazines could still say,
no, we're only going to pay you 10 cents of word
instead of a dollar fifty a word.
But I had the power to walk away.
I could say I'm only going to work for five dollars a word
and they could say, well, it's not worth it to us.
And they could walk away.
And so it's it's reasonable at that point to say I was paid
the equilibrium, as economists say, but basically a market
based fair amount.
So that's that's probably a good example of a market
that actually operates really well.
But that can happen when the product that you that you
manufacture or you produce is tangible.
You produce an article.
I know what that is.
Maybe some people pay you by the word.
Maybe there's a there's some kind of way to evaluate
the quality of each word.
You know, the pleasure that people that people get from
from reading or or or the information that they get
from what you read.
So over time you build yourself a reputation that
actually signals that, hey, what I write actually is worth
something and you get and you get paid accordingly.
So that's but the product, the bottom line here is that
the product is very, very simple.
Right.
So so we have two things.
We have an open competitive market.
It's very easy for me, for other people to compete with me.
So that pushes my bottom line down.
And it's at least it used to be relatively easy to for
there to be more magazines and newspapers.
This is true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So we've open competition and we have a clear
understandable product.
This is this is this is exactly right.
And and another one of the things that differentiates
finance from from from that situation is that the
products are not clear.
It's not entirely clear what is the product that
people are getting.
And moreover, the products are so complicated that
most people don't really understand what they're
buying when they buy a stock.
They very, very rarely understand the connection
between between the economic value of the firm, what its
prospect, what are its prospective earnings.
There are all kinds of projections into the future.
Most people don't understand how those things are done.
That's that's a situation in which not necessarily, but
evidently inefficient outcomes can emerge when you
have a product that is not entirely well understood.
And people are just going to say, well, this is an
amazing product.
How do you know?
Well, I just told you it's an amazing product.
Trust me.
Famous last words.
Trust me.
Right.
So Reshef is saying, I mean, I don't know if he
would approve of these words and he's traveling
in Europe, so I wasn't able to reach him.
But I here's how I summarize it.
And his words, I'm not saying I agree or
disagree.
I'm just saying how I summarize it is Wall
Street is not doing what I did as a freelance
writer.
They're not in a wildly open competitive
marketplace saying, here's what we want to do.
How much do you want to pay?
And let's come to an agreement.
What Wall Street is doing is saying, there's only
so many people who know how to do this and you
don't even understand what we're selling.
So we're going to hoodwink you and charge you
more for it.
The mystery is part of the game.
The mystery gives them an extra cushion, an
extra rent.
OK, so let's say we have this market that's
hard to get into and a product that is hard
to measure.
But did these guys have any sense of why it
happened like this, that the pay for these
people just got so out of control?
Reshef and Philippon say that if you look at
wages and finance compared to comparable
professions that the same sorts of people
might do, it's very interesting.
They said it's U-shaped.
At the beginning of the 20th century, right
up to 1929, Wall Street and finance folks are
paid way more than other people with a
similar education and whatever background.
And then for most of the 20th century,
they're actually paid a lot less, not less
than the rest of, obviously, Wall Street has
always been well paid, but a lot.
The extra premium is much smaller than it
was before the crash.
Less than in spooky days.
Right.
And then in the 80s, it starts picking up
again.
It actually drops a bit in the late 80s.
And then since the early 90s, it just
hurdles upward.
So he said that they were looking for
something else.
He calls this a U-shaped pattern, you
know, way high, low, then way high.
So they were just looking for anything
that could explain it, anything else that
was U-shaped.
And they only found one thing that seemed
to explain it perfectly.
And that's deregulation.
We believe and we try to argue in our
paper or more scientifically that the
deregulation is what's behind everything.
So more than the actual wages themselves
is the mechanism that allows them to
actually earn that much.
This mechanism had to do with very,
very little regulation of the product
that they sold.
They've sold very, very complicated
products that they did not.
A lot of people on Wall Street did
not understand.
And I have anecdotal evidence about
that, which was a huge, on colossal
scale, misallocation of capital.
People paid money into investments
that went bad.
And it's the way Wall Street compensation
worked, and we're doing a lot on this
at Planet Money, the way Wall Street
compensation worked is you had a
direct incentive, if you wanted a big
bonus, to make it very hard to figure
out how much risk you were taking on
or how much risk was in the products
you were selling.
You were selling very risky products,
but making them look like very safe
products, and you were moving them
out the door as quickly as possible
so that you could get more fees,
more bonuses, and the fact that you
got paid every year based on what
you sold that year, even if what
you were selling were time bombs
set to go off in five years or six
years.
So the whole incentive structure
was very wrong.
If the sector was better regulated
and real long-term gains were linked
to performance measures today,
they wouldn't have been able to
register the revenues that they
registered, and they wouldn't be
able to pay the high wages that
they paid.
So we're going to be talking about
a lot of these issues on our
upcoming partnership programs with
This American Life actually this
weekend.
David Kessenbaum and Alex
Blomberg have an awesome story
about credit rating agencies and
the incentives at play there.
And our own Chana Jaffee-Walt has
a story about the regulators and
ways in which the regulators
messed up.
So tune in to the watchmen on
This American Life this weekend.
Okay.
Planet Money Co.
production.
All right, folks.
We've spent this entire show
talking about all these people
who work in finance and how
they made too much money and how
they played a part in this
crisis.
And now it's time to hear from
one of them.
This call came into our apology
line.
You may remember we set up a
special phone line just for
people to call in and say they
were sorry for whatever role
they had played in wrecking the
economy.
But as you're going to hear,
this particular call doesn't
really add up to anything even
resembling a mea culpa.
Hi, this is Jung Ho Lee.
And it's actually all my
fault.
I used to work for a boutique
firm that used to buy mortgages
both of Alt-A and Subprime.
And secondly, mortgages.
And we used to create a
mortgage backed security
product.
So you can say that I've
basically created the entire
mess.
Now, am I apologetic for
this?
Not really.
And there are actually two
reasons for this.
The first being the fact that
investors, you and I and
everybody else, were asking
for returns on money in their
401Ks and IRAs.
That's something like 8% over
inflation, which would turn out
to be 12 to 15%.
So guys like me would go to
work and we would create some
kind of what looked to be
riskless product that could
actually get you those kinds
of returns.
And not once during the
entire boom did people
actually say, hey, this is
unsustainable or this is
unrealistic by actually
pulling money out of their
401Ks.
But you continue to funnel
money into them, so we
continue to create product.
So unless you pull money
out, that just gives Wall
Street the idea that you
like the idea and we will
continue to create the
product until the world
comes crashing down.
And the second issue is the
fact that everyone believes
that everyone else was doing
their homework.
You know, you go back to
well, the credit agencies
were running their risk
profile and my investment
manager was reading all
the docs when, in point
of fact, Wall Street is
basically an entire buyer
beware situation and you
have absolutely no real
security unless you
actually read all the
documents for yourself and
you understand them.
Now, I understand how
difficult CDO product is
to understand and CDO
squared product and credit
default swaps.
So if you don't
understand and you can't
get a straight answer, my
suggestion is to basically
not have invested in it
in the first place.
I mean, yes, you might
not be making the same
amount of money as the
guy down the block who's
your neighbor.
But, you know, when things
blow up, at least you'll
still have your savings
and you will.
Well, he'll be working for
the next 10 plus years
over after you.
And so, you know,
they have a big part
in creating some of
the mess.
Absolutely.
Am I apologetic?
Not so much.
All right.
Well, you got to love
how straightforward that
guy is.
Thank you.
Jung-ho Lee.
OK, you two can call
and apologize or
non-apologize for your
part in the financial
crisis.
I'll give you the number
202-371-1775.
I'll just say that once
more.
202-371-1775.
Start dialing, America.
There's still time to
get it all off your
conscience.
And when you're done
dialing, think about the
blog, the Planet Money
blog.
I posted photos today.
Thank you very much.
Listeners from our
Half Built America
series.
I'll bet a bunch of you
live near a place like
you're going to see in
this gallery.
It's on NPR.org slash
money.
And never mind that
giant photo of a kidney
also on the blog.
It's from the intern.
Yeah, he posted it.
Not his kidney, a
Creative Commons kidney
out of Flickr.
I'm Laura Conaway.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
We'll be right back.
