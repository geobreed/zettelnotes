If you've felt, say, in the last nine months or so that people who work on Wall Street make too much money, we've got a guest for you. Ariell Resheff, an economics professor at the University of Virginia, says you're right, and he can prove it. And we got a message on our apology line from a mortgage industry veteran who says he's at least a little bit responsible for the financial crisis. And he's not sorry.

    I live in Seattle, WA and there was a Psychic that rented a place across the street from my apartment. They became behind in their rent, so their landlord evicted them and he is now he is selling their items for help pay some of the back rent.

    I wonder if they saw it coming?
