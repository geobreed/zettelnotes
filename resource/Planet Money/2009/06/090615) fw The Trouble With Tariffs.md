You may have heard something about the new iPhone. But have you heard about the Harmonized Tariff Schedule? That's the giant book of guidelines by which import specialists like Brett Ewing and Jim Henderson classify everything from wood flooring to handheld gizmos for importing into the United States.

**faster whisper:**
The economy is actually getting better.
Things are getting better.
We have a long, long way to go.
But now you see what's happening.
We're having a situation where housing is starting to
improve, where lending is starting to come forward,
where we have a situation where we've gained some
control of the automobile companies who otherwise would
have had to be liquidated in terms of them staying in
business and having a prospect of growing.
Hey, welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt in Seattle.
And I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington, D.C.
It is Monday, June 15th.
And that was Vice President Joe Biden you heard at the top
speaking on NBC's Meet the Press this weekend.
And I have your Planet Money indicator for you right here.
It is the number five.
Five years, my friends.
Five long or short years, I guess, depending where you sit.
Five years since the U.S.
International Trade Commission considered Vietnamese
frozen fish fillets.
But they're doing it now.
Today, the International Trade Commission is
gathering, sitting in a conference room somewhere,
I guess, and deciding if someone wants to import
those fish fillets from Vietnam, what is the tax
they should have to pay to get them here?
Yes.
What should the duty rate be?
The commission will talk, they'll review, they'll
decide, which I got to say, strange job.
I guess we have a global economy, global trade.
So if you really think about it, we do need someone
to consider what duty rates for Vietnamese
frozen fish should be.
But still, what if that was your job to talk
about that all day?
And tomorrow, apparently, they're going to get
into lawn groomers from China.
So today we're going to be talking about our
economy and the strange jobs it creates and the
strange jobs that make the economy happen.
And strange job number one relates to the iPhone.
Hana, I don't know if you've heard, I got this
from a source on deep background, but there is
a new iPhone coming out.
You know, I did hear that, but only because
I got two emails from Apple, saw three ads
and read five articles about it.
You really have to be in the know to know
about this huge, world-shaking thing about
to happen, no one is talking about it.
So we decided, well, someone should really
take a look at this event.
And Hana, you drew the short straw.
Yeah, and we weren't interested in the new
features or the hype, but there is this one
group of people who have sort of a strange job
thanks to Apple, these guys, they're mostly guys
who wait for the new iPhone to come out.
They count the days and not so they can use
the Google or the MyFace, but so that they
can take the thing apart.
They get to know its insides.
People like Wayne Lamb with iSupply, his title
is Senior Tear Down Specialist.
Tear Down is very much what you imagine.
We're taking an electronic consumer device,
which is of course all packaged and assembled
and gleaming, and we try to document the disassembly
very much like we're telling a story.
So when we open up, for example, the iPhone,
we would really go after and identify
the key components.
How do you get that thing open?
Well, there are torque screws or small Allen wrenches.
It's basically held together by a couple of screws
at the base of the device where the connector is
and needless to say, it's not your ordinary tools
that you find at home.
So podcast listeners, if you are taking out
your screwdrivers and flipping over the iPhone
maybe that's playing this podcast,
stop, wait, don't do it or at least wait
until the podcast is over.
Yeah, and you don't ever have to do it
because iSupply and lots of other companies
do it for you.
There's this industry of tear downers
and they exist because Apple sees it
as a competitive advantage to keep its supply chain secret,
to keep all of the stuff inside the iPhone
and where it comes from secret.
They don't want people to know.
So why do they put the little screws in the back then?
Yeah, they haven't met one.
That's why they make them really small.
So these tech gadget guys, yeah,
they make it their job to get into those little screws
to take it apart and document piece by piece
how everything fits together.
So they'll figure out like where every chip is from,
who makes it, even if it means scraping off epoxy
piece by piece and acid baths and using microscopes,
they will figure out the story of the iPhone.
What did that mean when he said that, the story?
Basically it's just where it's from
and how much it costs to make it.
So they'll go, oh, okay, the display is from China
and the memory is from Korea and the CPU is from Germany
but it's actually manufactured in Singapore
and sort of piece by piece
they will put the story together.
The key to our analysis is that it's a bottoms up analysis.
A lot of times folks would say,
okay, what's the retail price and we take it from the top.
What we do is we build from the component level
so we know that is priced at this much
and the next component is priced at this much
and we roll that up individually
and then we add in things like manufacturing costs,
overhead.
And then you come out with a figure.
Right.
So last year, that last iPhone,
that figure was 173.
So 173 bucks, that's how much it cost Apple
to make the second generation iPhone.
And if you're a semiconductor supplier,
you want to know that supply chain information,
who got the iPhone contract?
What do they have that I don't have?
And iPhone competitors want to know what's in there
and environmentalists want to know
how much the batteries are going to destroy the earth.
So it's just like, it's just general market intelligence.
Yeah, and the 173 number, that's the cost number.
It's sort of weird because it's weird
how little the cost has to do with the price.
You mean what you pay when you go in a store
and actually buy one.
Right, so full disclosure,
I have walked into a store and bought an iPhone
and you think it costs Apple $173 to make it okay,
I'll pay a little bit more and that's it.
But that is not how the magic
of cell phone economics works.
It's not?
No, so Apple gets, this is just a guess,
let's say Apple gets 600 bucks for each phone.
Basically, they sell the iPhone to AT&T
and then AT&T charges you less,
like say 200 or 300 bucks.
That sounds insane.
AT&T buys the phones for 600 bucks
and then sells them for 300?
That is buy high, sell low.
Right, but when you walk in,
you get that little piece of paper
and you sign on the dotted line
that says AT&T will be your provider
for two years or however long.
Right, and that costs you.
So really, Hannah, for you, the iPhone,
probably is costing you more like 2,500, 3,000 bucks
over the next couple years or something?
You know, David, I felt so cool getting my first iPhone,
now you go and make me feel like a tool.
Come on, Trump, download the Lightsaber app,
that'll make you feel better.
Oh, I have it, wait, here.
Take that, David.
My wife loves that app.
All right, should we move on?
I think so.
All right, so I wanna talk about this other group of people
who they also huddle over things like the iPhone
and they try to make sense of them
in a really different way.
There's this office at the Port of Seattle here
that I recently discovered.
It's just this generic building,
cubicle farm, computers,
and it's full of these guys,
well, again, all I could see was guys,
whose job it is to categorize everything
that comes into the United States,
every single thing that comes on a boat
or a truck or a plane.
So this is a port.
These are things that are gonna be sold
in the United States.
Yeah, and their job,
they're called import specialists,
so something comes into the country and they classify it.
So David, perhaps you'd like to classify some wood.
If you wanted to know how to classify
a piece of wood flooring,
I handled that line and dealt with a lot of issues
with it, and I could say it's either 4409,
it's 4412 or 4418.
If it was surface covered, it wouldn't be 4409
if it was a multi-layered engineered flooring,
I could say it would be 4412.
What is he talking about?
He's talking about, his name is Brett Ewing,
and he's talking about how to classify wood flooring
according to the harmonized tariff schedule.
Yeah.
What?
Say it again.
Okay, so everything that comes into this country
gets assigned a duty rate, right, a tax,
and you have to declare it and pay customs.
Yeah, I mean, sort of like, I guess our,
we've all done that when we fly in on an airplane
from out of the country and you fill out the form, right?
Stuff you have to declare.
Exactly, so, and if you're a big importer
like Target or Walmart, or even if you're just like,
Bob's Burrito Bistro and hardware flooring
in Washtucna, Washington State,
you still have to declare what you're importing,
each and every item, and you have to pay duties on it.
So how much, that depends what it is.
A toy might be 3%, a car 5%, or a vacuum,
that'll be free.
So someone has to have the job of figuring out
what is a toy, what is a car, what's a vacuum.
That sounds pretty clear, I bet I could do that.
Yeah, well, David, you haven't met the book.
Meet the harmonized tariff schedule.
What did we just hear?
We just heard the tariff fall to the ground.
This is so exciting.
There's a, what, one, two,
there's about nine chapters here.
There are three chapters here.
And there are 85 chapters here.
Which is how we, huge.
Yeah, this is how we classify merchandise
entered in the United States.
I'd say it's kind of like our Bible.
This is what we work from.
It's everything that would be imported
into the United States.
Hannah, were you asking, were you having them
throw the books on the floor there to make a sound?
I know, don't tell anybody.
They were having so much fun doing it.
I know, they got so much joy out of it.
So that's the harmonized tariff schedule
and the way that it works is you take an item
and you work through every possible category
that that item could fit under.
So it's a linear progression.
You need to rule out all the proceeding options.
Something like an apple or a cow.
A cow, that's really easy.
You can easily say, this is not a flashlight,
not a piece of big machinery.
It's obviously chapter one, live animal,
section 0102, live bovine.
So the duty rate is one cent per kilo.
Yeah, see, that still seems pretty clear to me.
So we wrote it up in complex language.
Well, what if you want to import a monitor?
Is it a computer monitor or a TV monitor?
Because if it's a computer monitor, it's duty free.
But if it's got a TV receiver, it's not.
Or an Elvis doll.
Is that a collectible or is it a toy?
It seems like it should be easy.
But Brett's colleague, Jim Henderson,
you heard him a little earlier,
he comes over to me and he puts out his wrist.
I can tell you something that the average person
would think would be easy.
You can think of, well, I want to import a,
purchase a watch from London I saw in a catalog.
The watches can be very difficult to classify
because they could be classified under the case.
They can be classified whether or not
they're of a precious metal or stainless steel.
You can classify the band of the watch,
whether or not it's digital or analog,
how many jewels in the movement,
how many jewels in the case.
Then you're talking about country of origin,
just with something that you would think a watch.
So Brett pulls me back to his desk and he says,
you just have to see it done.
So let's just take something.
He looks around, there's an iPod docking station
next to his computer.
You know, one of those things you sit an iPod on
has speakers and a clock.
Yeah, it charges and you can like,
you can play your music through it or whatever.
Exactly.
So Brett says, okay, I look at that
and I can rule out the first 84 chapters.
He knows it's not an orange livestock
optical instrument or a toy.
I would first look at chapter 85.
What's chapter 85?
Chapter 85 is electrical machinery and equipment
and parts thereof, sound recorders and reciprocate
reproducers, television images and sound recorders.
Beginning of chapter 85 is for electric motors.
That's not right, it's gone.
Transformers, electromagnets.
Electric storage batteries.
Shavers, hair clippers.
Microwave ovens, hairdressing apparatus.
Coffee makers, we have automatic drip and pump type
percolator, other or other.
Telephone sets, microphones and stands thereof.
Loud speakers, but we don't know.
Maybe it's not considered, for tariff purposes
the speaker may not be considered a loud speaker.
Okay, I'm gonna just skip ahead a little bit here
or a lot, so this took a long time.
You know, all these questions,
is it a battery operated device?
It has a battery, you know, is it an alarm clock?
Well, that's probably not why you'd buy it
but it does have an alarm clock,
so Brett finally settles on this.
Perception apparatus for radio broadcasting,
whether or not combined in the same housing
with sound recording or reproducing apparatus or a clock.
So.
And it's free.
Hey, it's free, baby.
Well, not all of them, some of them are free.
Why, so why?
I mean, don't you often wonder why?
Like why, if it plugs into the wall,
then it's free. Does it make that difference?
But if it's FM or AM only, then it's 4.4%.
Yes, I do wonder that.
So what's the answer?
Because the harmonized tariff schedule says so.
That's not an answer.
Okay, so yeah, I mean, there is a rationale.
There's like a story to why each of these things
has its certain rate.
But sometimes it's really hard to figure out.
So each story has something to do
with protecting American industry.
Each includes a decision that favors someone,
preferably the US and punishes someone else.
So like textiles.
If you wanna import textiles
instead of buying textiles from a domestic manufacturer,
you have to pay high rates
because at some point the domestic textile industry
was really threatened by foreign textiles
coming in for cheap.
Or like footwear, shoes are taxed heavily.
But other stuff, like Brett sees a lot of computer chips
and small electronic pieces come through his desk.
And those have really low duty rates
because the US high tech industry
uses them to manufacture their products.
So we've decided to make it easy
for them to get that stuff cheap.
It's the same with machinery
and parts for the aerospace industry.
And of course, because rates are so all over the place,
importers try to game the system.
I mean, there are people importing BMWs
and saying, no, no, those are toys.
Those are toys.
Pencils.
Pencils was their big drama so far this year.
Pencils for school children.
And you could have a pencil coming in and a gift set.
That's gonna raise the flag
because in the past they've brought over those pencils
and they've infringed on
and or caused injuries to industries here.
Wait, pencils for school children
that raises a red flag?
Yes.
There's a domestic industry for a product.
Pencil manufacturers.
They have reason to believe
that foreign competition is unfairly flooding the market
with a product and selling it
at less than it costs them to make it.
You know that or they're getting refunded
by their own government.
In doing so, it snuffs out our domestic industry.
We've seen it with televisions.
We're currently seeing it with crawfish in the South.
Those industries, textiles,
that's why quotas are in place
is to protect the textile industry.
There's a new one for this funky thing
I got in my hand here
which is called the front seat service valve.
These are valves that go into air conditioning machines,
air conditioning units.
And we're asking ourselves
whether this chunky piece of metal
is subject to these additional duties.
If it is and these people aren't paying it,
then they're hurting the domestic industry.
And David, I called Brett to find out
if they had finally classified that chunky piece of metal
he was holding at the whole time we were talking.
And they did.
They determined that front seating service valves
from China are subject to higher duty rates
than was being paid and up to 55%.
Wow, it's pretty high.
We should point out here that most economists think
that entire book there of tariffs should really go away
because tariffs, most economists agree,
are not good for the global economy.
So I was talking to Adam Davidson about it this morning.
He was telling me that he once found a survey
that said that 3% of economists
thought tariffs were a good idea.
And he thought, who is that 3%?
So he went out, he tried to find them.
He talked to them.
And it turns out they were arguing
that in some special cases,
like a small poor country
trying to protect a new industry,
it might make sense.
But in general, economists argue
those tariffs actually make things more expensive for everyone.
So here's an example.
Say in China they make toothbrushes
that cost 50 cents each.
That's pretty cheap.
But there's also a place in Ohio
that makes them for one dollar.
So clearly those aren't going to sell.
So the United States slaps a 50 cent import tax
on toothbrushes.
Right now, everyone in America
is forking over a dollar for toothbrushes.
That they could be getting instead for 50 cents.
So the import tax is good for the factory in Ohio,
but it is bad in the big picture
because the global market is basically saying,
Ohio, you really should not be making toothbrushes.
The best place is China.
And a tariff stops that from happening.
It keeps Ohio in business when it shouldn't be.
Okay, so one final item today.
I'm really excited about this.
The Planet Money Road Trip.
And we need your help for this.
So Adam and Caitlin and I are going to be doing
a mini Planet Money Road Trip next week.
Maybe we're driving past you.
We're going to be in Boston for a WBUR event
next Wednesday, June 24th.
So we're going to start early
and make some stops along the way.
We're going to try and blog and podcast from the road.
So let us know, where should we stop?
Do you see anything good coming out of the recession?
Any new innovative businesses in your area
or along our route?
Maybe some interesting stimulus projects.
Again, we're leaving from New York City
and driving up to Boston.
So anywhere in between.
You can email us at planetmoney at npr.org.
You can post suggestions to our blog, npr.org slash money.
That does it for today.
I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Thank you for listening.
It don't matter, I won't do what you say.
You got the money and the power.
I won't go your way.
I can't take fall of people.
They don't matter at all.
I'll be waiting in the shadows
till the day that you fall.
I think it's like you're still all right.
I think I'm always losing to it.
I can't get away from the moment.
