Why flying to small airports keeps costing more and more, just as flying to big airports is getting cheaper. (This episode is from our new podcast, The Indicator. Subscribe to it wherever you get your podcasts.)

Our own Stacey Vanek Smith had to pay through the nose to fly home for Christmas. And not just because it was Christmas — her ticket was way more expensive than usual.

As we say in the news business: Stacey is not alone. Airfare dynamics have changed a ton in the past few years.

On today's show: Why it's getting cheaper to fly to some types of cities and more expensive to fly to others. Also: Why Stacey will probably get a better deal next year.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

Last month, I did what many millions of Americans did. I bought a plane ticket home for the holidays.

OK, depart 23rd, return 29th - finalizing prices.

CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST:

The suspense is killing me, to be honest - buffering.

VANEK SMITH: It's almost like thinking.

GARCIA: Buffering, buffering.

VANEK SMITH: So home for me is Boise, Idaho. It is always kind of an expensive flight because it's a small airport. There are not that many flights in and out. But this year was exceptional.

Okay so the cheapest flight home during those dates is $1,073.

Now, to be clear this was not a last-minute ticket. I was looking for these tickets in mid-November.

GARCIA: And you also have only five tickets left, so you actually have to buy it...

VANEK SMITH: Immediately.

GARCIA: ...Right now.

VANEK SMITH: Do you think if I don't buy them now, they'll go up? Or is this - they can't go higher.

They went higher. I waited a few days, very unwisely, and bought the tickets for - today's Planet Money INDICATOR - $1,277.10.

GARCIA: (Laughter) Oh, my God.

VANEK SMITH: That is how much I paid for a plane ticket home to Boise.

GARCIA: Stacey, as we say in the news business, you're not alone. Your story is part of this big, interesting shift in the U.S. airline industry because over the last five years tickets to smaller cities, like Boise, Idaho, have been getting more expensive while at the same time tickets between big cities, like New York and L.A. or between New York and Miami, they've been getting cheaper. So on today's show we ask, why is this happening?

VANEK SMITH: I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

GARCIA: I'm Cardiff Garcia.

VANEK SMITH: And this is THE INDICATOR from Planet Money.

GARCIA: A show about work, business and the economy.

VANEK SMITH: And a show where we are not afraid to put a price on love.

GARCIA: But that's becoming a closer call.

VANEK SMITH: We're getting down to pennies here (laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

VANEK SMITH: To understand why I had to pay so much to go home to Boise for the holidays, I called Henry Harteveldt. He's an airline analyst with the Atmosphere Research Group.

HENRY HARTEVELDT: You must love your family a great deal, and I hope they appreciate you an awful lot as well.

VANEK SMITH: Henry says ten years ago, there were a lot of big national airlines in the U.S. Price competition was really fierce. But then those airlines started buying each other.

HARTEVELDT: We've had a series of mergers. And now we have four super large airlines in the United States - American, Delta, Southwest and United - which collectively control more than 80 percent of the airline capacity in the United States.

VANEK SMITH: All of that merging in the airline industry means a lot less price competition. At the same time, the airlines were slimming way down - fewer flights, smaller planes.

HARTEVELDT: When you have fewer flights, fewer airlines and fewer seats, you end up with a higher average airfares into some of these less competitive cities.

VANEK SMITH: Less competitive cities like Boise.

GARCIA: Sorry, Stacey.

VANEK SMITH: Thank you, Cardiff. So I booked my flight out of Newark. And Henry told me the average price for tickets from Newark to Boise have risen about 10 percent over the last five years. And this is typical for smaller cities. But, Henry says, for people flying from one big city to another big city, it is a completely different story because while fares to smaller cities have been rising, fares between big cities have actually been falling.

GARCIA: And there's a pretty clear reason for this. Those new ultra-discount airlines - airlines like Allegiant, Frontier, Spirit - their prices are super cheap, and they're putting a ton of price pressure on the old-school airlines.

VANEK SMITH: Now, for me and all of my fellow travelers to less competitive cities, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The ultra-discount airlines are growing really fast and flying to more and more cities. And in fact, Allegiant has just started flying into Boise. Frontier is going to start flying into Boise next year. So Henry says it is very likely that my 2018 ticket home for Christmas will cost way less than $1,277.

GARCIA: And 10 cents.

VANEK SMITH: Yes, and 10 cents. Thank you, Cardiff.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: I was curious if you spent just a little bit more money, where you could go.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, no. (Laughter) Oh, no. Oh, no.

GARCIA: So just in case you're tempted...

VANEK SMITH: What?

GARCIA: Honolulu.

VANEK SMITH: No.

GARCIA: OK, which I hear is nicer this time of year...

VANEK SMITH: Than Idaho.

GARCIA: ...Than Boise. Don't get me wrong. I'm sure Boise's a lovely, lovely town. You could get there for 1,300 bucks. And Bueno Aires, where in fact the seasons are inverted, so it's actually summer.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah.

GARCIA: You can get there for 1,400 bucks. I'm sorry if I'm making you feel badly about this.

VANEK SMITH: No.

GARCIA: I'm just astounded by...

VANEK SMITH: It's astounding.

GARCIA: ...How expensive it is.

VANEK SMITH: I know. I know.
