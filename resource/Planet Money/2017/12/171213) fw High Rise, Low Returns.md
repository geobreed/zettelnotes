As a businessman, President Trump is known for his towering buildings. Today we tell the story of one of those skyscrapers and what it says about how and with whom Trump does business.

Trump SoHo is a high rise in lower Manhattan, part hotel, part condos; it's 46 stories tall, all slick grey glass. Conflicts, from zoning battles to accusations of fraud, have followed the project since it was announced during a 2006 episode of The Apprentice.

According to reports by Bloomberg News, Trump SoHo has attracted the interest of Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible ties between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and Russian officials.

#812: High Rise, Low Returns

To build Trump Soho, the Trump Organization worked with a company called Bayrock, founded by the wealthy Soviet-born financier Tevfik Arif, who, among other things, owned a chromium plant in Kazakhstan. Questions also surround another major player in the project, Felix Sater, who has a criminal history that includes stabbing a man during a bar fight, and pleading guilty to a securities fraud scheme that involved the mafia.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hi, I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: And I'm Cardiff Garcia.

VANEK SMITH: And we are super excited to tell you about a new thing that we've been working on.

GARCIA: Yep. It's called The Indicator from PLANET MONEY. You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts, wherever you listen to PLANET MONEY proper.

VANEK SMITH: It's like PLANET MONEY, but it is newsier and shorter and - of course, Cardiff, because we are hosting it - smarter (laughter).

GARCIA: Wittier.

VANEK SMITH: Just a lot smarter. I mean...

GARCIA: Even better looking somehow, yeah.

VANEK SMITH: ...A lot. So much better looking.

So go check it out. It is called The Indicator from PLANET MONEY, and you can find it wherever you get your podcasts. Here's today's show.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

NICK FOUNTAIN, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Nick Fountain, one of the producers here. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about the news business. If you work for a big company and you have some bad news, there are two perfect times to tell the world about it, Christmas Eve and the day before Thanksgiving. If you release your bad news on one of those days, chances are very few people will ever hear about it, which is why when on the day before Thanksgiving, we heard some news, we almost missed it. And we would have missed it if it weren't for one person.

KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: (Laughter) Hey, there.

FOUNTAIN: This is Kelly McEvers, of course, host of All Things Considered and also one of our favorite podcasts, Embedded. Kelly, the latest season of your show is about who - what exactly?

MCEVERS: President Donald Trump. We did stories about the real estate that has his name on it and about the people who he surrounds himself with.

FOUNTAIN: And today on the show, we are going to play a part of an episode you did about Trump SoHo. It's this big hotel condominium tower in Lower Manhattan.

MCEVERS: Right. It's called Trump SoHo, but Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, did not build this tower. They actually licensed the Trump name to the people who did build the tower, and then they manage the building. And then, on the day before Thanksgiving - this day when news can happen and people can miss it - the Trump Organization actually announced that they were cutting their ties with the building.

FOUNTAIN: So today we are not going to let them bury that news. We're going to play Kelly's terrific show about the developers that built Trump SoHo.

MCEVERS: There are actually a lot of developers of this building, and we focused on one in particular - it's this company called Bayrock - and a guy who worked at Bayrock, this guy named Felix Sater.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MCEVERS: All right, so now we're going to talk about one of the developers of Trump SoHo. And to know the story about this developer, you need to know the story of a guy named Felix Sater.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: The two NPR reporters who did this story are Alina Selyukh.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello, hello, hello.

MCEVERS: And Jim Zarroli.

JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: Hello, hello.

Sater was from the former Soviet Union, came here as a child, living in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, which is home to a lot of Russian immigrants.

MCEVERS: Felix Sater's father has a criminal history. He once pled guilty to extortion charges. And he wants his son to do better.

DAVID BARRY: He wanted Felix to be an above-board businessman. That was Felix's father's hope for his son.

ZARROLI: That's David Barry. He's a former AP reporter, and he's spent a lot of time covering organized crime. He covered the mob scene in Providence, R.I. He actually ended up writing a memoir with a guy named Sal Lauria, who is very good friends with Sater.

SELYUKH: And I should add here that we did try to talk to Felix Sater himself. Through his lawyer, he declined.

MCEVERS: So like David Berry just said, Felix Sater's father wants him to be an above-board businessman. He goes to a good high school. He takes some college classes but doesn't graduate. And then he becomes a stockbroker with his friend Sal Lauria.

SELYUKH: And so Felix Sater and this guy Sal Lauria grow up to be these high-flying brokers on Wall Street. They've got nice suits. They have nice watches. They're suave and dapper. And Felix Sater's trouble with the law starts at this party one night in 1991.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SELYUKH: Sal had just passed a broker's exam. It's very hard to pass. They're out celebrating.

BARRY: And it was a nice night of celebration at a nice restaurant that specialized in margaritas.

MCEVERS: There's this other broker who's there at the time. Somehow a fight breaks out over a woman.

BARRY: And Felix exploded and smashed this heavy margarita glass. You know, it was a goblet, not like a martini glass. And he just, in half a second or more, cut this guy's face open and kept swearing at him after knocking him down and leaving his face a bloody mass.

MCEVERS: The New York Times reported the man suffered nerve damage and later needed 110 stitches in his face.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SELYUKH: Felix Sater ends up going to prison, and he loses his broker's license.

BARRY: The really big thing for him was a felony conviction bars you from setting foot on a brokerage floor.

SELYUKH: Many years later, in 2016, Sater told a Russian news site that this drunken brawl, as he says, makes him a criminal. And he can't even get hired as a driver after this.

ZARROLI: And yet that really wasn't the end of Felix Sater's criminal career.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: After Felix Sater gets out of jail for the margarita glass incident, court documents show that he and Sal Lauria then started what's known as a pump-and-dump scheme.

ZARROLI: Sater and other people would buy up shares of stock through offshore accounts without telling investors about it. And by buying up a lot of shares, they would artificially inflate the price of the securities they were selling.

MCEVERS: Once the price was inflated, court documents say, they would sell the stock to unknowing investors. At the time, the FBI said Felix Sater and Sal Lauria were part of an operation that made $40 million this way.

ZARROLI: And we should say here that Sater and Sal Lauria weren't operating by themselves. They had help from the Italian Mafia.

MCEVERS: Again, this is from the court documents.

BARRY: To run something like that on a large scale, you need muscle.

ZARROLI: I mean, you can't just, you know, politely ask the other brokers not to sell the stock that you're trying to inflate.

BARRY: But if you have two guys who were soldiers for the Gambino family and they show up at the brokerage, the brokers listen. They're not listening to Hutton at that point. They're listening to Dominic and Sonny.

MCEVERS: Sal Lauria and Felix Sater's operation is discovered by authorities. They're arrested and accused of conspiring with the Mafia to launder money and defraud investors. In 1998, Felix Sater pleads guilty to one count of racketeering as part of this $40 million scheme. And here is where things get even more interesting. Instead of being sentenced for his crime...

ZARROLI: The charges against him were sealed, and the case against him was basically frozen for years. And the reason was that he turned state's evidence. He started to become a cooperating witness for the government, and he became a really valuable witness over the next 10 years or so.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ZARROLI: There was an FBI agent who testified at his sentencing hearing years later who said, you know, the difference between us cracking a case and not cracking a case is very often just one good, cooperating witness. And Felix Sater was that witness for us.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: One thing Felix Sater reportedly helped the U.S. government do was to try to get Stinger missiles. These are these shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles that have been used in Afghanistan off the black market. We read this in that book by David Barry and Sal Lauria. It's called "The Scorpion And The Frog." In the '90s, Sater reportedly traveled to Russia - remember, he's from there - and located a dozen of these Stinger missiles on the black market. Sater offered to buy the weapons, ostensibly to keep them away from terrorists. And in return, the CIA promised to keep Sater from going to prison. The deal ultimately fell through, but the contacts Sater were made were helpful to the CIA and the FBI after 9/11.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ZARROLI: We should say here that Sal Lauria disputed the accuracy of "The Scorpion And The Frog" right before it came out in an effort to stop it from being published in the early 2000s. But since then, David Barry says, Sal has told him the book is accurate after all. And Sal Lauria's name is still on the book.

SELYUKH: And this is where we now finally return to the story of Trump SoHo because what happens after this is Felix Sater has gone through a stint in jail and then turned as an informant in order to avoid his sentencing for the pump-and-dump scheme.

MCEVERS: But then, that second part becomes a secret. Like, everything you just heard about Felix Sater's $40 million pump-and-dump scheme and his cooperation with the government goes into a vault. As Jim said, the file is sealed by the court for years. And Felix Sater reinvents himself.

SELYUKH: And the next thing that he moves onto is a new real estate investment company called the Bayrock Group.

MCEVERS: A new real estate company called the Bayrock Group, one of the developers who would later go on to build Trump SoHo.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: And the reason we're talking about Felix Sater and Bayrock is because there are two very important questions, one of them reportedly of interest to investigators working with special counsel Robert Mueller right now. Here's the possible Mueller question - where did Bayrock get the money to help build Trump SoHo? And here's the other question - did Donald Trump know about Felix Sater's past as a convicted felon? Because if he did, well, that could be a problem.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: We'll have that part of the story after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

SELYUKH: So we've heard the story of Felix Sater. Now we're going to hear the story of this real estate company he joined, Bayrock. The company's founded in 2001. And in the next few years, they reportedly have their first meeting with Donald Trump. And they get an office at Trump Tower...

TIM O'BRIEN: ...Two floors beneath where the Trump family conducted their own business at the Trump Organization.

ZARROLI: That's Tim O'Brien. He's with Bloomberg. And he's been reporting on Donald Trump for decades. So at some point, Bayrock and the other developers come to Trump with this idea of building Trump SoHo.

SELYUKH: And the pitch is this. Let's build this 46-story condo hotel. You put your name on it, but you don't have to invest any of your money. We will raise the money. You'll get equity in the building. Plus, you'll be paid some management fees.

MCEVERS: It's called a licensing deal. Trump has done a lot of these kinds of deals over the years around the world. And here's why this deal made sense for Bayrock.

O'BRIEN: It's free publicity. The Trump name is known globally. For them, it amounted to hitching their wagon to a proven star, star of "The Apprentice," a well-known business name.

ZARROLI: And here's why that made sense for Trump. Remember, by this point, Trump's businesses have been through several bankruptcies. And Trump cannot get loans from major banks.

O'BRIEN: From Trump's perspective, anybody who walked into Trump Tower and put a bag of money on his desk could do business with him.

MCEVERS: This conclusion is based on what Tim O'Brien's sources have told him. So this licensing deal is clearly a win-win for Trump and Bayrock.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Applauding).

MCEVERS: Then comes that TV announcement.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE APPRENTICE")

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Located in the center of Manhattan's chic artist enclave, the Trump International...

MCEVERS: Now, we do not know everything about where Bayrock and the other developers of Trump SoHo got their money. But there is one guy who claims he has an inside view of Bayrock. He worked there. His name is Jody Kriss. And one of the few reporters who has interviewed Jody Kriss on the record is Tim O'Brien.

O'BRIEN: Well, Jody Kriss grew up in Miami. He was a very good student. He went to Wharton. He excelled in mathematics and finance.

ZARROLI: And he wanted to be a New York City real estate investor. So at one point, he meets Felix Sater.

O'BRIEN: And Felix called him up and said, you should come and join us at Bayrock. We've got a lot of money. We've got some big developments in the pipeline. And ultimately, they said, you'll get a chance to work with Donald Trump.

ZARROLI: So Jody Kriss goes to work at Bayrock.

O'BRIEN: And in fairly short order, he starts to realize that he's in the middle of what he would describe as a car crash. It's poorly managed. There's a lot of money flowing through it, but he doesn't know where the money's coming from.

MCEVERS: Jody Kriss later filed a lawsuit against Bayrock, which lays out all these allegations.

ZARROLI: In the suit, Jody Kriss says every time Bayrock ran out of cash, money would just magically show up, sometimes from another Bayrock founder's brother who had access to cash from a chromium refinery in Kazakhstan.

SELYUKH: And then in 2007, this investment fund from Iceland called a FL Group announces that it will invest $50 million in Bayrock. And Jody Kriss had never heard of it.

O'BRIEN: He inquired of his partners - well, who is the FL Group, and why are we doing business with them? And in fact, we have better offers - or at least comparable offers - from other investors. So why are we going with this bank? And Kriss was told, he says, that we have to go with the FL Group because it's closer to Putin.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia. Jody Kriss told Tim O'Brien he thought it was a joke when they said Putin's name - that he didn't know how to make sense of it all. The Kremlin has denied any connection to the FL group. And we should be clear here - taking money from Russian people isn't a crime.

But what Jody Kriss alleges in this lawsuit is that Bayrock was basically a money laundering operation. In other words, his suit says it was taking dirty money from Kazakhstan and Iceland and hiding it in what looked like a legitimate business, Bayrock, which built Trump SoHo. In the lawsuit, Jody Kriss says there's no evidence that Donald Trump took any part in or knew of Bayrock's racketeering schemes. Either way, Bayrock has denied the allegation.

SELYUKH: So back to Jody Kriss and this $50 million investment from FL Group to Bayrock - Jody Kriss was frustrated. He was a partner, but he wasn't getting his share.

ZARROLI: He went back to his partners and said, look, you owe me more money than you've paid out. The FL Group just put $50 million into our company. I think, based on that deal and others, I'm owed at least several million dollars.

MCEVERS: And this is where Jody Kriss says things get ugly.

O'BRIEN: And, according to Kriss, they said not only are we not going to pay you that but if you push the matter, physical harm will come to you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ZARROLI: Here's what the lawsuit actually says. Sater made him an offer he couldn't refuse. Either take $500,000, keep quiet and leave all the rest of his money behind, or make trouble and be killed.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: Jody Kriss would not talk to us on the record. Bayrock said it can't comment on ongoing litigation. And Felix Sater's lawyer told us Jody Kriss' lawsuit is extortionate litigation.

SELYUKH: Either way, there's one more important thing to know about Judy Kriss' lawsuit against Bayrock. The legal proceedings start dredging up Felix Sater's criminal past, specifically the pump-and-dump scheme that was kept secret once he started cooperating with the feds.

MCEVERS: And this is something Jody Kriss, in his lawsuit, says was a very big concern inside Bayrock.

ZARROLI: He says the firm did what it could to sort of hide the fact from investors, from securities officials. And they were worried about it all the time.

MCEVERS: Which gets us to the final question - did Donald Trump know about Felix Sater's conviction in the pump-and-dump scheme and his connection with the mob in that case? Because if he did, at the least, he did something unethical. And at the most, it's possible he broke the law.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: OK. So first, here's why this could be a problem. Companies are required to tell investors if they have someone working for them who has a relevant felony conviction. Jody Kriss' lawsuit says Bayrock hid Felix Sater's conviction. Some lawyers we talked to said that if Trump worked closely with principal fundraisers at Bayrock who hid this connection, it could be considered part of a conspiracy. Other lawyers say conspiracy would be a stretch. And they say there's no evidence that Trump was a principal fundraiser for Bayrock. That is what would require him to disclose Sater's conviction.

At the very least, if Trump knew about Sater's felony conviction and didn't disclose it, most of the lawyers we talked to said it's unethical and it shows the kind of person Trump is willing to deal with.

SELYUKH: So it is possible that from the time they met up until 2007, Donald Trump did not know about Felix Sater's financial crimes, that pump-and-dump scheme that he pled guilty to. Trump says his company does background checks as best it can.

MCEVERS: Either way, the whole story broke on December 17, 2007, when The New York Times published an article about Felix Sater. And it told the story of the margarita glass, the pump-and-dump conviction, the Stinger missiles. As for what happened next, a lawyer named Richard Lerner picks up the story from there. He's been involved in lawsuits against Bayrock for years, and he has internal Bayrock emails from that time. They were filed as part of the Jody Kriss lawsuit.

RICHARD LERNER: The New York Times article was published on December 17, 2007. Two days later, in the case of Donald Trump against Tim O'Brien, he was deposed.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ZARROLI: Yes, you heard that right - Donald Trump v. Tim O'Brien, the same Tim O'Brien from Bloomberg that you heard earlier. Like we said, he has reported on Trump for years. And Trump sued him for defamation.

MCEVERS: In a deposition from that lawsuit, Trump was asked whether he knew about Felix Sater's conviction in the pump-and-dump scheme. Trump says nobody knew anything about him. An attorney asks, have you severed your ties with the Bayrock Group as a result of this? Trump answers, well, I'm looking into it because I wasn't happy with the story. So I'm looking into it.

LERNER: Then on January 21, 2008 - just a few weeks later - there are internal emails at Bayrock saying, there's going to be a meeting. And Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Donald Trump Sr. are coming. Julius Schwarz, the general counsel of Bayrock, is coming. Sater will be there.

MCEVERS: Now, we don't know what that meeting was about. But remember, just five weeks earlier, The New York Times had published that article about Felix Sater.

LERNER: So in that email chain of January 21, 2008, I believe the very final email of the day is...

MCEVERS: Quote, "Donald is happy with me," Felix Sater says. "I'll explain when I see you."

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: So in 2007, Donald Trump says, I'm looking into it. In 2008, Felix Sater writes, Donald is happy with me. And as recently as 2010, Felix Sater had a business card that said senior adviser to Donald Trump, the Trump Organization. And in that Russian interview he gave, Sater actually says for 10 years, he reported everything to Trump, quote, "sometimes twice a day, sometimes twice a week, sometimes twice a month."

Then, in 2013, Trump does this interview with the BBC's John Sweeney.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "BBC PANORAMA")

JOHN SWEENEY: Why didn't you go to Felix Sater and say - you're connected with the Mafia, you're fired?

TRUMP: Well, first of all, we were not the developer there. That was a licensing deal...

SWEENEY: But your name was on it.

TRUMP: ...A very simple licensing deal.

SWEENEY: But your name's on it, Mr. Trump.

TRUMP: Excuse me. But I don't know - you're telling me things that I don't even know about. I mean, you're telling me about Felix Sater. I know who he is. I know of him, and I know who he is.

SWEENEY: You stayed in bed, if I may say so, with Felix Sater. And he was connected with the Mafia.

TRUMP: Again, John - maybe you're thick - but when you have a signed contract, you can't, in this country, just break it. Sometimes we'll sign a deal, and the partner isn't as good as we'd like. But that does happen.

ZARROLI: We should say, contracts can be broken or renegotiated. And then, Trump just ends the interview.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "BBC PANORAMA")

TRUMP: And by the way, John, I hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting. So I have to leave.

SWEENEY: OK. No - one last question please, sir.

TRUMP: I have to leave. Thank you.

SWEENEY: OK. All right then. Sir, let me shake your hand.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MCEVERS: The same year of this BBC interview, in 2013, Trump is asked again about Felix Sater in another deposition, this one related to a Bayrock property in Florida.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So help you God?

TRUMP: I do.

MCEVERS: Here's a recording of some of that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: I don't think he was connected to the Mafia. He got into a barroom fight. And - in fact, he was supposedly very close to the government of the United States as a witness or something. He got into trouble because he got into a barroom fight, which a lot of people do. I don't because I don't drink. But, you know, again, I don't know him very well. But I don't think he was connected to the Mafia.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: About how many times have you conversed with Mr. Sater in...

TRUMP: Over the years?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Over the years, if you could estimate.

TRUMP: Not many.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Not many?

TRUMP: If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn't know what he looked like.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. So when you say not many, I mean, is that - can you count that on one hand?

TRUMP: No, I wouldn't know what to say about that because I don't know. He would call - I think he dealt mostly with my company, not with me.

MCEVERS: This is how licensing deals work - right? I just had my name on the thing. I wasn't involved in the day to day. Jody Kriss told Tim O'Brien Trump was involved in the day to day - that even if Donald Jr. shook your hand on a deal, he might come back downstairs to renegotiate if his father told him to.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S "VIBE DRIVE")

MCEVERS: OK. So how does any of this relate to Robert Mueller and the special investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia? We know from recent reports the investigation is broadening to include the financial dealings of Trump and his associates. We know the team will be looking at contacts made during the development of Trump SoHo between Trump and his associates and any Russians who could later have been trying to influence the election.

We know that Felix Sater has contacts in Russia. That's where his family's from. He helped the U.S. government there. And he's testified he traveled there with Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump to try to drum up support for a Trump Hotel in Moscow. That hotel never happened. And now we know that Felix Sater, in 2015, sent this email - first reported by The New York Times - to Donald Trump's lawyer, quote, "our boy can become president of the USA, and we can engineer it." He goes on, "I will get all of Putin's team to buy in on this. I will manage this process." The White House says that email is a non-story.

Oh, and as for Bayrock and Trump SoHo, Bayrock has basically been dormant for several years. It hasn't done business in a while. Jody Kriss is in settlement talks with the company. After the financial crisis, Trump SoHo was sold in a foreclosure auction to another real estate company, which now runs it mostly as a hotel. The Trump Organization still gets management fees. Since Donald Trump became president, the restaurant in Trump SoHo closed, and sports teams have refused to stay there. A new restaurant is about to open. And of the nearly 400 units in the building, about a third of them have been sold.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODINGTON BEAR'S "AIRLINER")

Hi, I'm Stacey Vanik-Smith. And I'm Cardiff Garcia. And we're super excited to tell you
about a new thing that we've been working on. Yep, it's called the Indicator from Planet
Money. You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts, wherever you listen to Planet
Money proper. It's like Planet Money, but it is newsier and shorter and of course
Cardiff because we are hosting it. Smarter. Wittier. Just a lot smarter. Even better
looking. So much better looking. So go check it out. It is called the Indicator
from Planet Money. And you can find it wherever you get your podcasts. Here's today's
show. Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Nick Fountain, one of the producers
here. And I'm going to let you in on a little secret about the news business.
If you work for a big company and you have some bad news, there are two perfect
times to tell the world about it. Christmas Eve and the day before
Thanksgiving. If you release your bad news on one of those days, chances are
very few people will ever hear about it, which is why when on the day before
Thanksgiving we heard some news, we almost missed it. And we would have
missed it if it weren't for one person.
Hey there. This is Kelly McEvers, of course, host of All Things Considered
and also one of our favorite podcasts Embedded. Kelly, the latest
season of your show is about who, what exactly?
President Donald Trump. We did stories about the real estate that has his name on
it and about the people who he surrounds himself with.
And today on the show, we are going to play a part of an episode you did
about Trump Soho. It's this big hotel condominium tower in Lower
Manhattan. Right. It's called Trump Soho, but Trump and his company, the
Trump Organization, did not build this tower. They actually licensed the
Trump name to the people who did build the tower and then they managed the
building. And then on the day before Thanksgiving, this day when news can
happen and people can miss it, the Trump Organization actually announced
that they were cutting their ties with the building.
So today we are not going to let them bury that news. We're going to
play Kelly's terrific show about the developers that built Trump Soho.
Actually, a lot of developers of this building and we focused on one in
particular. It's this company called Bayrock and a guy who worked at Bayrock,
this guy named Felix Seder.

story of a guy named Felix Seder.
The two NPR reporters who did the story are Alina Seljuk and Jim Zerulli.
Hello. Hello.
Seder was from the former Soviet Union, came here as a child, living in the
Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, which is home to a lot of Russian
immigrants.
Felix Seder's father has a criminal history.
He once pled guilty to extortion charges and he wants his son to do
better.
He wanted Felix to be an aboveboard businessman.
That was Felix's father's hope for his son.
That's David Berry.
He's a former AP reporter and he's spent a lot of time covering organized crime.
He covered the mob scene in Providence, Rhode Island.
He actually ended up writing a memoir with a guy named Sal Loria, who is very
good friends with Seder.
And I should add here that we did try to talk to Felix Seder himself.
Through his lawyer, he declined.
So like David Berry just said, Felix Seder's father wants him to be an
aboveboard businessman.
He goes to a good high school, he takes some college classes, but doesn't
graduate. And then he becomes a stockbroker with his friend, Sal Loria.
And so Felix Seder and this guy, Sal Loria, grow up to be these high
flying brokers on Wall Street.
They got nice suits, they have nice watches, they're suave and dapper.
And Felix Seder's trouble with the law starts at this party one night in
1991.
Sal had just passed a broker's exam.
It's very hard to pass.
They're out celebrating.
And it was a nice night of celebration at a nice restaurant that specialized in
margaritas.
There's this other broker who's there at the time.
Somehow a fight breaks out over a woman.
And Felix exploded and smashed this heavy margarita glass.
You know, it was a goblet, not like a martini glass.
And he just in half a second or more cut this guy's face open.
And kept swearing at him after knocking him down and leaving his face a bloody
mass.
The New York Times reported the man suffered nerve damage and later needed 110
stitches in his face.
Felix Seder ends up going to prison and he loses his broker's license.
The really big thing for him was a felony conviction bars you from setting
foot on a brokerage floor.
Many years later, in 2016, Seder told a Russian news site that this drunken
brawl, as he says, makes him a criminal and he can't even get hired as a
driver after this.
And yet that really wasn't the end of Felix Seder's criminal career.
After Felix Seder gets out of jail for the margarita glass incident, court
documents show that he and Sal Loria then started what's known as a pump
and dump scheme.
Seder and other people would buy up shares of stock through offshore
accounts without telling investors about it.
And by buying up a lot of shares, they would artificially inflate the
price of the securities they were selling.
Once the price was inflated, court documents say they would sell the
stock to unknowing investors.
At the time, the FBI said Felix Seder and Sal Loria were part of an
operation that made 40 million dollars this way.
And we should say here that Seder and Sal Loria weren't operating by
themselves.
They had help from the Italian mafia.
Again, this is from the court documents.
To run something like that on a large scale, you need muscle.
I mean, you can't just politely ask the other brokers not to sell the
stock that you're trying to inflate.
But if you have two guys who are soldiers for the Gambino family and
they show up at the brokerage, the brokers listen.
They're not listening to Hutton at that point.
They're listening to Dominic and Sonny.
Sal Loria and Felix Seder's operation is discovered by authorities.
They're arrested and accused of conspiring with the mafia to launder
money and defraud investors.
In 1998, Felix Seder pleads guilty to one count of racketeering as
part of this 40 million dollar scheme.
And here is where things get even more interesting.
Instead of being sentenced for his crime, the charges against him
were sealed and the case against him was basically frozen for years.
And the reason was that he turned state's evidence.
He started to become a cooperating witness for the government and he
became a really valuable witness over the next 10 years or so.
There was an FBI agent who testified at a sentencing hearing years later
who said, you know, the difference between us cracking a case and not
cracking a case is very often just one good cooperating witness.
And Felix Seder was that witness for us.
One thing Felix Seder reportedly helped the U.S.
government do was to try to get Stinger missiles.
These are these shoulder fired surface to air missiles that have been
used in Afghanistan off the black market.
We read this in that book by David Berry and Sal Loria.
It's called The Scorpion and the Frog.
In the 90s, Seder reportedly traveled to Russia.
Remember, he's from there and located a dozen of these Stinger
missiles on the black market.
Seder offered to buy the weapons ostensibly to keep them away from
terrorists. And in return, the CIA promised to keep Seder from going
to prison. The deal ultimately fell through, but the contacts Seder
made were helpful to the CIA and the FBI after 9-11.
We should say here that Sal Loria disputed the accuracy of the
Scorpion and the Frog right before it came out in an effort to
stop it from being published in the early 2000s.
But since then, David Berry says Sal has told him the book is
accurate after all.
And Sal Loria's name is still on the book.
And this is where we now finally return to the story of Trump
Soho, because what happens after this is Felix Seder has gone
through stint in jail and then turned as an informant in
order to avoid his sentencing for the pump and dump scheme.
But then that second part becomes a secret.
Like everything you just heard about Felix Seder's 40 million
dollar pump and dump scheme and his cooperation with the
government goes into a vault.
As Jim said, the file is sealed by the court for years.
And Felix Seder reinvents himself.
And the next thing that he moves on to is a new real
estate investment company called the Bayrock Group.
A new real estate company called the Bayrock Group, one
of the developers who would later go on to build Trump
Soho. And the reason we're talking about Felix Seder and
Bayrock is because there are two very important questions.
One of them reportedly of interest to investigators
working with special counsel Robert Mueller right now.
Here's the possible Mueller question.
Where did Bayrock get the money to help build Trump
Soho? And here's the other question.
Did Donald Trump know about Felix Seder's past as a
convicted felon?
Because if he did, well, that could be a problem.
We'll have that part of the story after the break.

So we've heard the story of Felix Seder.
Now we're going to hear the story of this real estate
company he joined.
Bayrock. The company is founded in 2001 and in the
next few years they reportedly have their first
meeting with Donald Trump and they get an office at
Trump Tower.
Two floors beneath where the Trump family conducted
their own business at the Trump Organization.
That's Tim O'Brien.
He's with Bloomberg and he's been reporting on
Donald Trump for decades.
So at some point Bayrock and the other developers
come to Trump with this idea of building Trump
Soho.
And the pitch is this.
Let's build this 46 story condo hotel.
You put your name on it but you don't have to
invest any of your money.
We will raise the money.
You'll get equity in the building.
Plus you'll be paid some management fees.
It's called a licensing deal.
Trump has done a lot of these kinds of deals
over the years around the world.
And here's why this deal made sense for Bayrock.
It's free publicity.
The Trump name is known globally.
For them it amounted to hitching their wagon
to a proven star, the star of the apprentice,
a well-known business name.
And here's why that made sense for Trump.
Remember by this point Trump's businesses have
been through several bankruptcies and Trump
cannot get loans from major banks.
From Trump's perspective anybody who walked into
Trump Tower and put a bag of money on his
desk could do business with them.
This conclusion is based on what Tim O'Brien's
sources have told him.
So this licensing deal is clearly a win-win
for Trump and Bayrock.
Then comes that TV announcement.
Located in the center of Manhattan's chic artist
enclave, the Trump International Hotel.
Now we do not know everything about where
Bayrock and the other developers of Trump
Soho got their money.
But there is one guy who claims he has an
inside view of Bayrock.
He worked there.
His name is Jody Chris.
And one of the few reporters who has
interviewed Jody Chris on the record is Tim O'Brien.
Well Jody Chris grew up in Miami.
He was a very good student.
He went to Wharton.
He excelled in mathematics and finance.
And he wanted to be a New York City real
estate investor.
So at one point he meets Felix Seder.
And Felix called him up and said you should
come and join us at Bayrock.
We've got a lot of money.
We've got some big developments in the
pipeline.
And ultimately they said you'll get a chance
to work with Donald Trump.
So Jody Chris goes to work at Bayrock.
And in fairly short order he starts to
realize that he's in the middle of what
he would describe as a car crash.
It's poorly managed.
There's a lot of money flowing through it
but he doesn't know where the money is
coming from.
Jody Chris later filed a lawsuit against
Bayrock which lays out all these
allegations.
In the suit Jody Chris says every time
Bayrock ran out of cash money would just
magically show up.
Sometimes from another Bayrock founder's
brother who had access to cash from a
chromium refinery in Kazakhstan.
And then in 2007 this investment fund
from Iceland called FL Group announces
that it will invest 50 million dollars
in Bayrock.
And Jody Chris had never heard of it.
He inquired of his partners well who
is the FL Group and why are we doing
business with them.
And in fact we have better offers or
at least comparable offers from other
investors.
So why are we going with this bank.
And Chris was told he says that we
have to go with the FL Group because
it's closer to Putin.
Vladimir Putin the president of Russia.
Jody Chris told Tim O'Brien he thought
it was a joke when they said
Putin's name that he didn't know how
to make sense of it all.
The Kremlin has denied any connection
to the FL Group and we should be
clear here.
Taking money from Russian people
isn't a crime.
But what Jody Chris alleges in this
lawsuit is that Bayrock was basically
a money laundering operation.
In other words his suit says it was
taking dirty money from Kazakhstan
and Iceland and hiding it in what
looked like a legitimate business
Bayrock which built Trump Soho.
In the lawsuit Jody Chris says
there's no evidence that Donald
Trump took any part in or knew of
Bayrock's racketeering schemes.
Either way Bayrock has denied the
allegation.
So back to Jody Chris and this
50 million dollar investment from
a FL Group to Bayrock.
Jody Chris was frustrated.
He was a partner but he wasn't
getting his share.
He went back to his partners
and said look you owe me more
money than you've paid out.
The FL Group just put 50
million dollars into our company.
I think based on that deal and
others I'm owed at least several
million dollars.
And this is where Jody Chris says
things get ugly.
And according to Chris they said
not only are we not going to pay
you that but if you push the
matter physical harm will come to
you.
Here's what the lawsuit actually
says.
Seder made him an offer he
couldn't refuse.
Either take five hundred
thousand dollars keep quiet and
leave all the rest of his money
behind or make trouble and be
killed.
Jody Chris would not talk to us
on the record.
Bayrock said it can't comment on
ongoing litigation.
And Felix Seder's lawyer told
us Jody Chris's lawsuit is
extortionate litigation.
Either way there is one more
important thing to know about
Jody Chris's lawsuit against
Bayrock.
The legal proceedings start
dredging up Felix Seder's
criminal past.
Specifically the pump and dump
scheme that was kept secret once
he started cooperating with the
feds.
And this is something Jody Chris
and his lawsuit says was a very
big concern inside Bayrock.
He says the firm did what it
could to sort of hide the fact
from investors from securities
officials and they were worried
about it all the time.
Which gets us to the final
question.
Did Donald Trump know about
Felix Seder's conviction in
the pump and dump scheme and
his connection with the mob in
that case.
Because if he did at the
least he did something
unethical.
And at the most it's possible
he broke the law.
OK so first here's why this
could be a problem.
Companies are required to tell
investors if they have someone
working for them who has a
relevant felony conviction.
Jody Chris's lawsuit says
Bayrock hid Felix Seder's
conviction.
Some lawyers we talked to said
that if Trump worked closely
with principal fundraisers at
Bayrock who hid this
conviction it could be
considered part of a
conspiracy.
Other lawyers say conspiracy
would be a stretch and they
say there's no evidence that
Trump was a principal
fundraiser for Bayrock.
That is what would require him
to disclose Seder's
conviction.
At the very least if Trump
knew about Seder's felony
conviction and didn't
disclose it most of the
lawyers we talked to said
it's unethical and it
shows the kind of person
Trump is willing to deal
with.
The Trump organization did not
comment on this or anything
else in this story.
So it is possible that from
the time they met up until
2007 Donald Trump did not
know about Felix Seder's
financial crimes that pump
and dump scheme that he
pled guilty to.
Trump says his company does
background checks as best it
can.
Either way the whole story
broke on December 17th 2007
when the New York Times
published an article about
Felix Seder and it told the
story of the Margarita
glass the pump and dump
conviction the Stinger
missiles.
As for what happened next a
lawyer named Richard
Lerner picks up the story
from there.
He's been involved in
lawsuits against Bayrock
for years and he has
internal Bayrock emails
from that time they were
filed as part of the
Jody Chris lawsuit.
The New York Times
article was published on
December 17th 2007.
Two days later in the
case of Donald Trump
against Tim O'Brien he
was deposed.
Yes you heard that right
Donald Trump versus Tim
O'Brien the same Tim
O'Brien from Bloomberg
that you heard earlier.
Like we said he has
reported on Trump for
years and Trump sued him
for defamation.
In a deposition from that
lawsuit Trump was asked
whether he knew about
Felix Seder's conviction
in the pump and dump
scheme.
Trump says nobody knew
anything about him.
An attorney asks have
you severed your ties
with the Bayrock group
as a result of this.
Trump answers well I'm
looking into it because I
wasn't happy with the
story.
So I'm looking into it.
Then on January 21 2008
just a few weeks later
there are internal emails
at Bayrock saying there's
going to be a meeting
and Donald Jr.
Ivanka Eric and Donald
Trump senior are coming.
Julia Schwartz the
general counsel of Bayrock
is coming Seder will be
there.
Now we don't know what
that meeting was about
but remember just five
weeks earlier the New
York Times had published
that article about Felix
Seder.
So in that email chain
of January 21 2008 I
believe the very final
email of the day is
quote Donald is happy
with me Felix Seder
says I'll explain when
I see you.
So in 2007 Donald
Trump says I'm looking
into it.
In 2008 Felix Seder
writes Donald is happy
with me.
And as recently as 2010
Felix Seder had a
business card it said
senior adviser to Donald
Trump the Trump
organization.
And in that Russian
interview he gave last
year Seder actually says
for 10 years he
reported quote everything
to Trump sometimes twice
a day sometimes twice a
week sometimes twice a
month.
Then in 2013 Trump
does this interview with
the BBC's John Sweeney.
Why didn't you go to
Felix Seder and say
you're connected with the
mafia you're fired.
Well first of all we
were not the developer
there. That was a licensing
deal.
But your name was on it.
A very simple licensing
deal.
But your name's on it Mr.
Trump.
Excuse me but I don't
know you're telling me
things that I don't even
know about.
I mean you're telling me
about Felix Seder.
I know who he is.
I know of him and I
know who he is.
You stayed in bed
if I may say so
with Felix Seder
and he was connected
with the mafia.
Again John maybe you're
thick but when you
have a signed contract
you can't in this country
just break it.
Sometimes we'll sign a deal
and the partner isn't as
good as we'd like but that
does happen.
We should say contracts
can be broken or
renegotiated.
And then Trump just ends
the interview.
And by the way John I
hate to do this but I do
have that big group of
people waiting so I have
to leave.
OK one last question
please sir.
I have to leave.
Thank you.
OK all right then.
So let me show you a
hand.
The same year of this
BBC interview in 2013
Trump is asked again
about Felix Seder.
In another deposition
this one related to a
Bayrock property in
Florida.
I do.
Here's a recording of some
of that.
I don't think he was
connected to the mafia.
He got into a bar room
fight and
in fact he was supposedly
very close to the
government of the United
States as a witness or
something.
He got into trouble
because he got into a
bar room fight
which a lot of people do.
I don't because I don't
drink.
But you know again
I don't know very well
but I don't think he
was connected to the
mafia.
About how many times
have you have you
conversed with Mr.
Seder.
Over the years over the
years if you could ask
not many not many.
If he were sitting in the
room right now I really
wouldn't know what he
looked like.
So when you say not
many I mean is that
can you count that on
no I wouldn't know what
to say about that
because I don't know he
he would call.
I think he dealt mostly
with my company not
with me.
This is how licensing
deals work right.
I just had my name on
the thing.
I wasn't involved in
the day to day.
Jody Chris told Tim
O'Brien Trump was
involved in the day
to day that even if
Donald Jr.
shook your hand on a
deal he might come
back downstairs to
renegotiate if his
father told him to.
OK so how does any
of this relate to
Robert Mueller and the
special investigation
into whether the Trump
campaign colluded
with Russia.
We know from recent
reports the investigation
is broadening to include
the financial dealings
of Trump and his
associates.
We know the team will
be looking at contacts
made during the
development of Trump
Soho between Trump
and his associates
and any Russians
who could later have
been trying to influence
the election.
We know that Felix
Sater has contacts
in Russia.
It's where his family's
from he helped the
U.S. government there
and he's testified he
traveled there with
Donald Jr.
and Ivanka Trump
to try to drum up
support for a Trump
hotel in Moscow.
That hotel never happened.
And now we know that
Felix Sater in 2015
sent this email
first reported by
the New York Times
to Donald Trump's
lawyer.
Quote our boy can
become president of
the USA and we can
engineer it.
It goes on.
I will get all of
Putin's team to buy
in on this.
I will manage this
process.
The White House says
that email is a
non story.
Oh and as for Bayrock
and Trump Soho.
Bayrock has basically
been dormant for
several years.
It hasn't done business
in a while.
Jody Chris is in
settlement talks with
the company.
After the financial
crisis Trump Soho
was sold in a
foreclosure auction
to another real
estate company which
now runs it mostly
as a hotel.
Since Donald Trump
became president sports
teams have refused
to stay there.
Earlier this year the
restaurant in Trump
Soho closed saying
business was down.
Though a new one has
since opened.
And just last month
the Trump organization
announced that the
Trump name is
coming off the
building and they'll
no longer manage it
by the end of the
year.
