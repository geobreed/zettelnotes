We've got a satellite. We got a rocket. We're heading to the launch pad.

It's launch day for the Planet Money satellite, POD - 1, and our intrepid Planeteers discover all the superstitions and complications of going to space. We eat the traditional pancake breakfast with the launch team. And we learn that the one time they did not eat pancakes, the rocket didn't make it to orbit.

SPACE 4: 3 2 1

That's not the only launch danger. Will Marshall, the CEO of our satellite partner Planet, always makes a speech where he lists what can go wrong (BOOM). But Will says taking risks is actually part of the business plan.

Even if POD - 1 does make it to space, there is one more obstacle. Actually, there are thousands of them. Little bits of space junk. How does a rocket and a satellite avoid them all? We visit the people who make sure we have a clear path to the heavens.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Stacey.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

Robert.

R. SMITH: It's launch day - launch day for the PLANET MONEY satellite - October 31, 2017 - Halloween.

S. SMITH: Today, the PLANET MONEY satellite, Pod 1, is going to space.

R. SMITH: So, of course, the first thing we have to do is join the launch crew at a restaurant for pancakes.

S. SMITH: Because tradition.

R. SMITH: Of course.

MIKE SAFYAN: And if we have, like, a launch in the middle of the night, we're doing pancakes now because that's part of how we get ready for a launch.

CHESTER GILLMORE: I think we didn't eat pancakes one time, and the rocket didn't make it to orbit. So we don't mess around with that anymore.

S. SMITH: The pancake gods are not to be trifled with.

R. SMITH: Get an omelet, lose your rocket.

S. SMITH: So that was Mike Safyan and Chester Gillmore from the company Planet. You may remember them. They helped build the PLANET MONEY satellite, and they made sure it got here to the coast of California for the launch.

R. SMITH: Now, Planet paid for the launch. They're sending up a bunch of small satellites on the same rocket as ours. And so they get the ceremonial place of honor. Chester - he always wears a bow tie - he will be sitting in mission control.

GILLMORE: As the spacecraft mission director, highest authority over lunch.

R. SMITH: What does that mean? You can, at the last minute, just say, like, we're pulling this? We're not doing it?

GILLMORE: I could, at the last minute, say no go, and everything stops.

R. SMITH: He is so proud of this title. And everyone else at the table just sort of rolls their eyes at him.

S. SMITH: The satellite company they work for is one of those laid-back Silicon Valley firms. But on launch day, there is military precision. There is a definite hierarchy. All of the team leaders sit in a room with headsets, staring at screens, barking commands in the radio, waiting for Chester.

GILLMORE: So if things go perfectly, all I'll say is go a couple times. SMD - go for launch.

R. SMITH: SMD - go for launch. There's a lot riding on that command. This is the first time Planet has filled an entire rocket with just their satellites. They're taking all of the risk and proving that small satellites - they can have a rocket just like the big kids. People who care about the future of the space business are watching this launch.

S. SMITH: And then there's us.

R. SMITH: And our satellite, Pod 1.

S. SMITH: (Laughter) We are a podcast launching a satellite into space. And this is our one shot at this. We're not going to get a second chance.

(SOUNDBITE OF JASON ZAFFARY, JOHN HUNTER JR. AND JONATHAN SLOTT'S "THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS")

S. SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

R. SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. We have the checklist. Ready for systems check.

S. SMITH: Ready.

R. SMITH: Rocket status.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Vehicle Minotaur-C engineering team is go.

R. SMITH: Safety team.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: SE is go.

S. SMITH: MFCO, not sure what you do, but are you ready?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: MFCO go.

R. SMITH: Chester, do the honors.

GILLMORE: SMD - go for launch.

R. SMITH: Let's do it.

S. SMITH: Whew.

R. SMITH: To launch a rocket you need two things - well, three things because you need the rocket. But you also need a vast, empty space with no people for miles around and an incredible technical infrastructure of radar and communications equipment.

S. SMITH: That is why we are launching from a military base just north of Santa Barbara, Calif., Vandenberg Air Force Base.

R. SMITH: Which, at least on this morning, might be the most deserted place on the California coast. On launch day, the military clears the beaches, keeps boats away, stops planes from flying overhead.

S. SMITH: Now, this is a completely commercial launch. Orbital ATK built the rocket. Planet rented the space onboard for its satellites. But because it's on a military base, there are military personnel involved in every part of the launch.

R. SMITH: And military protocols and military traditions. I mean, personally, I just wanted to see a little satellite, Pod 1, blast into space. But there are things that we had to do first. We had paperwork and errands that we had to run around the base. First stop is a bland, little office building called JSPOC.

S. SMITH: Like Spock Spock?

R. SMITH: Like S-P-O-C...

(LAUGHTER)

R. SMITH: ...The Joint Space Operations Center.

S. SMITH: I'm going to think of it like Spock.

R. SMITH: They're sort of the air traffic control of space. We have to check in with them to make sure our satellite isn't being launched smack-dab into another satellite. Boom.

S. SMITH: Lieutenant Colonel Mia Walsh and Diana McKissock are already on the case.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: And they're probably doing a check right about now.

R. SMITH: To make sure that our rocket will make it through - and nothing but clear space ahead.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Correct.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: So we will track it all the way from when it launches, as it goes through its different trajectories, as it reaches its final orbit. And then we'll monitor the entire time.

R. SMITH: JSPOC is the keeper of a list that I had never heard of before, the space catalog, which is exactly as amazing as it sounds. The space catalog is a list of everything that anyone has ever sent into orbit.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: The catalog itself includes every single object - manmade object since Sputnik. However, currently, we only track 23,000 objects that are currently still on orbit.

R. SMITH: The way JSPOC tracks these 23,000 objects is amazing. They have radar and telescopes, and they actually watch the objects moving through the sky. They can spot something the size of a softball hurdling around the planet.

S. SMITH: And over the life of our satellite, if our little Pod 1 gets within a kilometer of anything else - so potentially might crash into something - they will send us an email...

R. SMITH: They have an email system.

S. SMITH: ...(Laughter) That says, watch out, PLANET MONEY. You might want to move your satellite.

R. SMITH: These e-mails are a free service of the U.S. government. Don't say they never gave you anything. They send them to satellite owners all around the world any time a satellite comes close to another satellite, which is amazing. But they're trying to avoid an incident like the one that happened in 2009.

S. SMITH: The infamous Iridium-Cosmos.

R. SMITH: Yeah. A dead Russian satellite called Cosmos 2251 collided with a communications satellite, Iridium 33. And we don't know if it made a sound. We don't know what the collision looked like. But JSPOC saw it on the screen. And from their point of view, it was frightening.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So our radars actually said it should be one object here and one object there. But now it appears to be hundreds of different objects.

R. SMITH: No. When they collided, it created hundreds of little bits of satellite?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: It actually overall created 2,000 pieces of debris which we still all track to this day.

R. SMITH: Every little bit.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Yeah. Well, I mean some have decayed and re-entered. But we try...

R. SMITH: Do they stay together as a little cloud? Or do they...

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: No.

R. SMITH: No.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: They disperse, and they come close to other satellites. So we're constantly tracking these pieces of debris. And now they're actually causing close approaches with other satellites still - what? - eight years later.

R. SMITH: This is bringing up my whole space junk anxiety problem.

S. SMITH: Yes. Well, it would be terrible for Pod 1 to go down in infamy by smashing into the International Space Station, for example.

R. SMITH: Oh, it's bad (laughter).

S. SMITH: But JSPOC tells us that space is much bigger than we can conceive. There are tens of thousands of objects up there, but there's still plenty of room. We have a clear path through.

R. SMITH: Fingers crossed. All right. JSPOC - check. We have one more stop before launch. It is a golf course owned by the military base, although they don't really use it for that anymore. They use it for parties, like this one.

S. SMITH: There's one of those big, white wedding tents all set up. There is a taco truck and a selfie station.

R. SMITH: You can take a picture with a model of a satellite. And, of course, we did.

S. SMITH: There's a nice buffet. And this is where the folks from Planet, our partner satellite company, have come to set up shop.

R. SMITH: We had to confirm all the scheduling pieces of today with Planet. They do technically own our satellite. We should be upfront about that. And they will be doing all of the maneuvering once Pod 1 is in space.

S. SMITH: Because nobody wants to let a podcast steer a satellite.

R. SMITH: Not a chance. We don't even really know what's going to happen today. The co-founder and the CEO of the company, Will Marshall, was there. We asked him, so where exactly will the rocket go?

WILL MARSHALL: Hopefully, mainly up.

R. SMITH: Mainly up. But over there?

MARSHALL: And then laterally so that it gets around the Earth.

S. SMITH: You have to make it simple for the podcasters.

R. SMITH: We appreciate it. Will is an old hand at this. This is Planet's 20th launch. They have roughly 200 small satellites in orbit - so many satellites that they usually do not have a party, do not have a buffet or a selfie station. But this one was so close to their San Francisco office that they brought in everybody.

S. SMITH: In about an hour, Will is going to give a short speech, just like at a wedding. But unlike at a wedding, hopefully, Will is going to warn everyone that the day could end in failure and disaster.

MARSHALL: Launches can get delayed. That happens quite a lot. So bear with us if it gets delayed. And, occasionally, they blow up. And that's very unfortunate, of course. And all the work that we put into those satellites - but we...

R. SMITH: Do you say that to the party?

MARSHALL: Absolutely. Yeah, because we have to be - remember that if that happens, we've got a backup plan, which is we've got next launches that are coming up in a few months. So get people prepared. But, generally, it's also about having fun and watching this launch. If it's successful, it'll be a really, really fun day.

R. SMITH: I have to say I have been impressed with how comfortable Will and everyone at Planet is with this concept of risk. Back in the old days, when NASA was the only game in town, I mean, obviously nobody wanted to take a risk with human beings onboard a billion-dollar spacecraft. But the advantage of these small satellites and these cheaper rockets is that the stakes are just lower. You can take more chances. You can try new technologies. You can invent things faster. And if something goes wrong, Will says, you just try again.

S. SMITH: And we ask Will how we will know if this risk paid off, if Pod 1 made it to space, if our mission was successful. And he gives us these magic words to listen for on the walkie-talkie.

MARSHALL: Normally, we pop the champagne when we get confirmation that it was successfully injected into orbit.

S. SMITH: And what does he say if it's successful?

MARSHALL: They will say satellite separation.

R. SMITH: Satellite separation - then Pod 1 will be free of the Earth, free of the rocket and finally out on its own.

S. SMITH: And we would love to stay and hear Will's speech and possibly check out the taco truck because it did look very delicious. But we were offered a chance to get closer to the launch pad. So, of course, we said yes.

R. SMITH: This is it. It's finally happening.

S. SMITH: Our rocket is going up in about 90 minutes.

R. SMITH: We drove to the meeting spot on the other side of the Air Force base. We got on this old school bus and were driven miles into the most remote part of the base to a little patch of dirt and scrub brush.

Thanks.

(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)

S. SMITH: So we can't see the rocket. But they tell us it is just over the ridge.

R. SMITH: There are just a few people here - military officers, photographers people from the rocket company Orbital ATK, people like John Steinmeyer.

JOHN STEINMEYER: The pad is evacuated for at least a couple miles away. We're probably about as close as anyone at the site here.

R. SMITH: You may remember John from our very first episode. He stands next to us, helping us decode the launch chatter that comes over this walkie-talkie that we're holding.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: LC vehicle - the FTS internal voltage and currents are nominal.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And I copy that, vehicle.

STEINMEYER: Nominal is our favorite word.

S. SMITH: What's nominal mean? What does nominal mean?

STEINMEYER: It means everything is OK.

S. SMITH: Nominal (laughter)?

STEINMEYER: Yeah. Yeah.

S. SMITH: That is, I think, the most sort of - if there's a word that is calmer than nominal, I've never heard it.

R. SMITH: So if someone says it is non-nominal...

STEINMEYER: Probably off-nominal.

R. SMITH: Off-nominal?

S. SMITH: Off-nominal. That means big trouble (laughter)?

R. SMITH: It means run.

S. SMITH: (Laughter).

STEINMEYER: It means it's not nominal (laughter).

S. SMITH: It's all fun and jokes until we get within a couple of minutes of the launch. Then, suddenly, everyone gets really quiet.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: T-minus 30 seconds.

S. SMITH: (Whispering) They said T-minus. They said T-minus.

R. SMITH: I don't know why everyone's whispering.

S. SMITH: We're whispering because it's very serious and tense at the launch site. And we're getting all of this very critical information at a very low volume over, like, a circa 1985 walkie-talkie.

R. SMITH: They do give us one final tip. They said, listen. Do not be alarmed when you don't hear the rocket.

S. SMITH: The rocket is apparently so far away that we will see it first, and then the sound will wash over us.

R. SMITH: I have this weird feeling, like when you're in a chair, and you tilt back, and you're about to fall, and you pull yourself back. It's that level of, like, fear and anticipation. And I find myself hoping that whatever happens in the space business, this moment never changes.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Five, four, three, two, one. We have ignition.

R. SMITH: I don't hear anything.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Vehicle has cleared the tower. Umbis are disconnected.

R. SMITH: Oh. Whoa. Whoa. It's so bright.

S. SMITH: Oh, my gosh.

R. SMITH: It's shooting up so fast. Oh, you can barely stare at it.

S. SMITH: There's, like, a flame behind it.

R. SMITH: Oh, my God.

S. SMITH: Whoa. Whoa. It's hard to look at it.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Altitude remains nominal. Capture 120. Stage zero motor - 104-foot-tall Minotaur-C vehicle away from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

S. SMITH: That look successful?

R. SMITH: I don't know.

S. SMITH: This was a really strange moment. I mean, I was standing there, holding a bottle of champagne. We just watched a rocket shoot into the sky. It seemed like everything had gone well. But everyone is standing around the walkie-talkie, staring at the ground, looking, like, deadly serious - like, heart-attack serious.

R. SMITH: Because it's not about the rocket. Everyone's waiting to hear about the satellites. That's what everyone here paid for. It's the most crucial part of the mission. And it's about to happen.

S. SMITH: Everybody's waiting. Everybody crowded around that walkie-talkie.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Stage one TVA has been pressurized. Stage zero has burned out.

R. SMITH: So we're following along with this, trying to sort of picture what is happening right now in space. And then that calm voice says something pretty terrifying.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And ROC - ROC. This is vehicle on countdown one. We have negative telemetry in the center here of Building 836. Was just hoping you could confirm the track of the vehicle view radar.

R. SMITH: That means they've lost contact with it, I think.

S. SMITH: Negative telemetry. So we can't see the rocket anymore. It's gone through the clouds. It's up in the atmosphere somewhere. And, apparently, it has stopped sending data back to mission control. It's not communicating with mission control anymore. It has stopped sending data back to Earth. They don't know what's going on.

R. SMITH: And I - for some reason, I just keep looking up to the sky, like I'm going to see something before they do.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: And once again, we have negative telemetry in the center.

S. SMITH: It is so quiet. And you can feel the tension in the air.

R. SMITH: And then...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: This is vehicle on countdown one. We have recovered telemetry in the center. We are now 230 seconds into the flight.

R. SMITH: That's good.

S. SMITH: Are we in the clear?

(CHEERING)

S. SMITH: I literally thought I was going to throw up while that was happening.

R. SMITH: I was already writing the end of the series in my mind, and it was not a happy ending.

S. SMITH: But even though we can't understand what on earth the man said, it's clear that everything is back on track, perfectly normal. The covering at the top of the rocket has opened up.

R. SMITH: And at this point, we're just listening for any mention of the PLANET MONEY satellite, Pod 1. They do not call it by the name Pod 1. The nickname on the launch chatter is Dove 3. And so the greatest moment in PLANET MONEY history almost just goes by us. It's so quick.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Expected deployment of Dove 1 and 3.

R. SMITH: That's it. Let's do it.

(SOUNDBITE OF POPPING CHAMPAGNE)

S. SMITH: All right.

R. SMITH: Other people paid the money. Other people did the work. But we did the reporting. Cheers.

S. SMITH: Cheers.

R. SMITH: It must have been the good-luck pancakes.

S. SMITH: (Laughter) Well, we did it. Somewhere up above the Earth is a cube satellite with our name on it.

R. SMITH: That I've touched. It says PLANET MONEY Pod 1. And there's a waveform of our voices on the side. And if you could read it in space, whoever that would be - it would say, hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY.

S. SMITH: The PLANET MONEY satellite is official. It is now circling the earth.

R. SMITH: Our producer Elizabeth Kulas has been holding the microphone this whole time through this incredibly tense moment, recording everything, not saying a word. And now you can tell she is a little bit choked up.

ELIZABETH KULAS, BYLINE: I'm kind of emotional. I thought that was really beautiful. I know I started crying while I saw it. I couldn't believe that human ingenuity could be so amazing.

R. SMITH: I could just stand here all day, looking at the sky, thinking about what had just happened.

S. SMITH: Imagining Pod 1.

R. SMITH: But this is a military base. And they are already checking their watches and pointing to the bus and being like, PLANET MONEY, time to go.

S. SMITH: So we gather up our microphones and the plastic champagne glasses.

R. SMITH: And our goodie bags and our newfound knowledge of space lingo.

S. SMITH: It's been a nominal day.

R. SMITH: Extremely nominal day.

And we walked back to the school bus and headed home.

(SOUNDBITE OF JASON ZAFFARY, JOHN HUNTER JR. AND JONATHAN SLOTT'S "THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS")

R. SMITH: Meanwhile, 300 miles above our head...

S. SMITH: A satellite is born. And not a soul can see it.

R. SMITH: Ninety minutes after launch, Pod 1 one makes its first full orbit the earth. It whips over the North Pole at 17,000 mph.

S. SMITH: At this point, it's just a spinning box. Picture a loaf of bread tumbling through the sky.

R. SMITH: But somewhere in the first few hours, it speaks for the first time. It's just a ping that says, I'm here. I'm alive.

S. SMITH: Over the next couple of weeks, the computers that control Pod 1 try to stabilize the craft. There are these little wheels that spin inside of the satellite. And each time you change the spin, it nudges the satellite a little.

R. SMITH: By mid-November, Pod 1 is stable, and its solar panels have unfolded. It is a camera now, and it is pointed down at Earth.

S. SMITH: And just this week, just in time to finish the series, we get a call from Planet. Our satellite has taken its first pictures. This moment is called first light.

R. SMITH: First light. We were so excited. Took a while to set up the conference call, though.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)

R. SMITH: I'm now hearing it echo again.

SAFYAN: OK.

R. SMITH: Is that because...

SAFYAN: Technology.

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)

R. SMITH: (Laughter) You know, we can send a satellite to space, right?

SAFYAN: I know. Right. Right.

R. SMITH: OK. So, Stacey, Mike has sent us an email here with a batch of photos. Let me pull it up here. It's the Earth. This is the first thing that Pod 1 ever saw.

S. SMITH: Oh, my God. There it is. It's, like, blue and white.

SAFYAN: So the first set of images was collected over northeastern Russia.

R. SMITH: Ah. Like Siberia, Sakhalin and that kind of thing.

S. SMITH: So somewhere under those clouds is Russia.

R. SMITH: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And those are just the first, crappy photos.

S. SMITH: First pancake.

R. SMITH: It does get better. Look.

SAFYAN: The next image is in North Korea, everyone's favorite place to zoom around in via satellite.

S. SMITH: Oh, no way. North Korea? I've always wanted to see North Korea. And there it is.

R. SMITH: I think that is a runway. And you can see mountains. And you can see this road here and some buildings.

S. SMITH: And a big river.

R. SMITH: There are little, tiny boats on the river.

S. SMITH: Oh. Where hasn't - it's already seen more of the world than I have (laughter).

R. SMITH: We can see it all.

S. SMITH: I feel like this is a cliche, but the Earth looks really beautiful from 300 miles up. It's really extraordinary to see the world in this way.

R. SMITH: I've seen a lot of photos from space, but these feel personal. It's like when your toddler draws her first picture.

S. SMITH: Aww.

R. SMITH: But I better check with Mike. Mike, how do these photos compare with the other satellites you have?

SAFYAN: This is pretty good. I'm quite pleased with Pod 1's performance.

S. SMITH: I feel like I knew Pod 1 was gifted.

R. SMITH: When I was talking to the people who work at Planet, they said one of the things they enjoyed about this series was to see people excited about satellites again. I mean, they have almost 200 of them. And Mike was telling me he just sort of thinks of it as a cloud of satellites and not a, like, single miraculous thing.

SAFYAN: I think that it's - in some ways, I think about it as, you know, like commercial air travel. It used to be a really big deal when an airplane was flying. And now it's just kind of, like, oh, man. Got to get to New York, and the thing is 20 minutes late. It's a sign of progress.

R. SMITH: (Laughter) I don't know how to feel about that. I know that's progress, but it's kind of sad.

SAFYAN: (Laughter) Well, I know what you mean. I know what you mean.

R. SMITH: I don't want to end this whole thing in a sad way. Give me an inspirational way for us to end this.

SAFYAN: You have a satellite in space. There's nothing to be sad about. It is zooming, around taking pictures of everywhere imaginable. It's a satellite.

R. SMITH: It's a satellite. It's a satellite.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRYAN JAMES SAMMIS AND DANIEL ABRAHAM BRAUNSTEIN'S "BLUE EYES")

R. SMITH: Hey. I just wanted to thank all of you, the listeners, for sticking with us through our space mission. I sort of felt like we were doing it on behalf of all of you. So please send us an email. Tell us what you thought - planetmoney@npr.org. Or you can find us on Twitter or Facebook. We have been getting all of your emails about a possible future mission for Pod 1. And we will have a follow-up episode in a few months where we use our satellite to hopefully change the world.

S. SMITH: For the better.

R. SMITH: Didn't say that.

S. SMITH: (Laughter).

R. SMITH: Today's episode was produced by the wonderful Elizabeth Kulas, who produced the entire space series and made it happen.

S. SMITH: Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer. And Bryant Urstadt is our editor.

R. SMITH: Special thanks go to David Gersen and Jordy Pushwari (ph), to Michael Stonecypher, out of Vandenberg Air Force Base, who kept us on time and on mission. And a special, special thanks to Trevor Hammond and all of the people at Planet who believed in us and let us adopt a satellite. One of their company's missions is to teach people about the world, to make the world a smaller, better place. And they were fantastic in allowing us this view inside the small satellite industry we would never have gotten otherwise. So thanks to Planet.

S. SMITH: And this whole adventure - in fact, all of PLANET MONEY would not be possible without the amazing support of NPR and the amazing support of the member stations. And so this month, if you enjoyed the series and would like to hear more, please think about giving to your local member station. Visit donate.npr.org/planetmoney to give and then share why you did with the hashtag #WhyPublicRadio.

R. SMITH: I'm Robert Smith.

S. SMITH: And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. Thanks for listening.

R. SMITH: One last thing, Stacey. Remember when I mentioned the space catalog?

S. SMITH: Yes.

R. SMITH: Here it is right here. You'll notice at the top of the list...

S. SMITH: No way.

R. SMITH: At the top of the list...

S. SMITH: Sputnik.

R. SMITH: ...Is Sputnik.

S. SMITH: That's awesome.

R. SMITH: And let me go to the bottom of the list. Right here - catalog number 42,996. The 42,996th thing that ever went to space is the PLANET MONEY satellite.

S. SMITH: Is that us?

R. SMITH: That is us.

S. SMITH: Robert Smith, we're official.

R. SMITH: We're in the catalog - 42,996.

S. SMITH: I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: I'm Cardiff Garcia.

S. SMITH: And we are here with a new show.

GARCIA: The Indicator.

S. SMITH: It's three days a week. It's about five minutes per show. And it is from the people who make PLANET MONEY.

GARCIA: Mostly about work, business and the economy.

S. SMITH: On every show, we take some number in the news or term or a story. And we dive into it to find the big idea behind it. And what we really hope is that in every show...

GARCIA: Well, look. At least almost every show.

S. SMITH: ...We'll bring you a new idea.

GARCIA: Some new lens through which to see the world. The Indicator from PLANET MONEY.

**faster whisper:**
Stacey.
Robert.
It's launch day, launch day for the Planet Money Satellite, October 31st, 2017, Halloween.
Today the Planet Money Satellite, pod 1, is going to space.
So of course the first thing we have to do is join the launch crew at a restaurant
for pancakes.
Because tradition.
Of course.
Even if we have like a launch in the middle of the night, we're doing pancakes
now because that's part of how we get ready for a launch.
I think we didn't eat pancakes one time and the rocket didn't make it to orbit.
So we don't mess around with that anymore.
The pancake gods are not to be trifled with.
Get an omelette, lose your rocket.
So that was Mike Safian and Chester Gilmore from the company Planet, you may remember
them.
They helped build the Planet Money Satellite and they made sure it got here to the
coast of California for the launch.
Now Planet paid for the launch.
They're sending up a bunch of small satellites on the same rocket as ours.
And so they get the ceremonial place of honor.
Chester, he always wears a bow tie, he will be sitting in mission control.
As the spacecraft mission director, highest authority over launch.
What does that mean?
You couldn't at the last minute just say like, we're pulling this, we're not
doing it.
I could at the last minute say no go and everything stops.
He is so proud of this title and everyone else at the table just sort of rolls their
eyes at him.
The satellite company they work for is one of those laid backs looking valley
firms.
On launch day, there is military precision, there is a definite hierarchy.
All of the team leaders sit in a room with headsets, staring at screens, barking commands
in the radio, waiting for Chester.
So if things go perfectly, all I'll say is go a couple of times.
SMD go for launch.
SMD go for launch.
There's a lot riding on that command.
This is the first time Planet has filled an entire rocket with just their satellites.
They're taking all of the risk and proving that small satellites, they can have a rocket
just like the big kids.
People who care about the future of the space business are watching this launch.
And then there's us.
And our satellite, pod one.
We are a podcast launching a satellite into space.
And this is our one shot at this.
We're not going to get a second chance.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Stacey Vanek-Smith.
And I'm Robert Smith.
We have the checklist ready for systems check.
Ready.
Vehicle Minotaur C. Engineering team is go.
Safety team.
SC is go.
MIFCO.
Not sure what you do, but are you ready?
MIFCO go.
Chester, do the honors.
SMD go for launch.
Let's do it.
Whew!

To launch a rocket, you need two things.
Well three things because you need the rocket.
But you also need a vast empty space with no people for miles around and an
incredible technical infrastructure of radar and communications equipment.
That is why we are launching from a military base just north of Santa Barbara, California,
Vandenberg Air Force Base.
Which at least on this morning, might be the most deserted place on the California
coast.
On launch day, the military clears the beaches, keeps boats away, stops planes from
flying overhead.
Now this is a completely commercial launch.
Orbital ATK built the rocket, Planet rented the space on board for its satellites,
but because it's on a military base, there are military personnel involved in every
part of the launch.
And military protocols and military traditions.
I mean personally, I just wanted to see our little satellite pod one blast into space.
But there are things that we had to do first.
We had paperwork and errands that we had to run around the base.
First stop is a bland little office building called J Spock.
Like Spock Spock.
Like SPOC, the Joint Space Operations Center.
I'm going to think of it like Spock.
They're sort of the air traffic control of space.
We have to check in with them to make sure our satellite isn't being launched smack
dab into another satellite.
Boom.
Lieutenant Colonel Mia Walsh and Diana McKissick are already on the case.
And they're probably doing a check right about now.
To make sure that our rocket will make it through and nothing but clear space ahead.
Correct.
So we will track it all the way from when it launches as it goes through its
different trajectories as it reaches its final orbit and then we'll monitor it the
entire time.
J Spock is the keeper of a list that I had never heard of before.
The space catalog, which is exactly as amazing as it sounds.
The space catalog is a list of everything that anyone has ever sent into orbit.
The catalog itself includes every single object, manmade objects in Sputnik.
However, currently we only track 23,000 objects that are currently still on orbit.
The way J Spock tracks these 23,000 objects is amazing.
They have radar and telescopes and they actually watch the objects moving through the sky.
They can spot something the size of a softball hurtling around the planet.
And over the life of our satellite, if our little pod one gets within a kilometer of
anything else, so potentially might crash into something, they will send us an email.
They have an email system that says watch out planet money.
You might want to move your satellite.
These emails are a free service of the U.S. government.
Let's say they never gave you anything.
They send them to satellite owners all around the world any time a satellite comes close
to another satellite, which is amazing.
But they're trying to avoid an incident like the one that happened in 2009.
The infamous Iridium Cosmos.
Yeah, a dead Russian satellite called Cosmos 2251 collided with a communication satellite
Iridium 33.
And we don't know if it made a sound.
We don't know what the collision looked like.
JSpock saw it on the screen.
And from their point of view, it was frightening.
So our radars actually said it should be one object here and one object there.
But now it appears to be hundreds of different objects.
No.
No.
When they collided, it created hundreds of little bits of satellite.
It actually overall created 2000 pieces of debris, which we still all track to
this day.
Every little bit.
Well, I mean, some have decayed and reentered, but we do they stay together as a little cloud
or do they know they they disperse and they come close to other satellites.
So we're constantly tracking these pieces of debris.
And now they're actually causing close approaches with other satellites still, what, eight
years later.
This is bringing up my whole space junk anxiety problem.
Yes.
Well, it would be terrible for pod one to go down in infamy by smashing into
the International Space Station.
But J Spock tells us that space is much bigger than we can conceive.
There are tens of thousands of objects up there, but there's still plenty of room.
We have a clear path through.
Fingers crossed.
All right, J Spock, check.
We have one more stop before launch.
It is a golf course owned by the military base, although they didn't really use it
for that anymore.
They use it for parties like this one.
There's one of those big white wedding tents all set up.
There is a taco truck and a selfie station.
You can take a picture with a model of a satellite.
And of course we did.
There's a nice buffet.
And this is where the folks from Planet, our partner satellite company, have come
to set up shop.
We had to confirm all the scheduling pieces of today with Planet.
They do technically own our satellite.
We should be upfront about that.
And they will be doing all of the maneuvering once pod one is in space.
Because nobody wants to let a podcast steer a satellite.
Not a chance.
We don't even really know what's going to happen today.
The co-founder and the CEO of the company, Will Marshall, was there.
We asked him, so where exactly will the rocket go?
Hopefully mainly up and then laterally so that it gets around the Earth.
You have to make it simple for the podcasters.
We appreciate it.
Will is an old hand at this.
This is Planet's 20th launch.
They have roughly 200 small satellites in orbit.
So many satellites that they usually do not have a party, do not have a buffet
or a selfie station.
This one was so close to their San Francisco office that they brought in everybody.
In about an hour, Will is going to give a short speech, just like at a wedding.
But unlike at a wedding, hopefully, Will is going to warn everyone that the day could
end in failure and disaster.
Launches can get delayed.
That happens quite a lot.
So bear with us if it gets delayed.
And occasionally they blow up.
And that's very unfortunate, of course, and all the work that we put into those satellites.
Do you say that to the party?
Absolutely.
Yeah, because we have to remember that if that happens, we've got a backup plan, which
is we've got for next launches that are coming up in a few more months.
So get people prepared.
But generally, it's also just about having fun and watching this launch.
If it's successful, it will be a really, really fun day.
I have to say, I have been impressed with how comfortable Will and everyone at
Planet is with this concept of risk.
Back in the old days when NASA was the only game in town.
I mean, obviously, nobody wanted to take a risk with human beings on board and billion
dollar spacecraft.
But the advantage of these small satellites and these cheaper rockets is that the stakes
are just lower.
You can take more chances.
You can try new technologies.
You can invent things faster.
And if something goes wrong, Will says, you just try again.
And we ask Will how we will know if this risk paid off, if pod one made it to
space, if our mission was successful.
And he gives us these magic words to listen for on the walkie talkie.
Normally we pop the champagne when we get confirmation that it was successfully injected
into orbit.
And what does he say if it's successful?
They will say satellite separation.
Satellite separation.
Then pod one will be free of the earth, free of the rocket, and finally out on its
own.
And we would love to stay and hear Will's speech and possibly check out the
taco truck because it did look very delicious.
But we were offered a chance to get closer to the launch pad.
So of course we said yes.
This is it.
It's finally happening.
Our rocket is going up in about 90 minutes.
We drove to the meeting spot on the other side of the Air Force base.
We got on this old school bus and we're driven miles into the most remote part of
the base to a little patch of dirt and scrub brush.
So we can't see the rocket, but they tell us it is just over the ridge.
There are just a few people here, military officers, photographers, people from the
rocket company, Orbital ATK, people like John Steinmeier.
The pad is evacuated for at least a couple of miles away.
We're probably about as close as anyone at this site here.
You may remember John from our very first episode.
He stands next to us helping us decode the launch chatter that comes over this
walkie talkie that we're holding.
LC vehicle, FTS internal voltage and current are nominal.
And I copy that vehicle.
Nominal is our favorite word.
Everything is OK.
Nominal?
That is, I think, the most sort of calm.
If there's a word that is calmer than nominal, I've never heard it.
So if someone says it is non-nominal.
Probably off-nominal.
Off-nominal?
Off-nominal. That means big trouble.
It means run.
It means it's not nominal.
It's all fun and jokes until we get within a couple of minutes of the launch.
Then suddenly everyone gets really quiet.
Minus 30 seconds.
They said D minus.
They said D minus.
I don't know why everyone's whispering.
We're whispering because it's very serious and tense at the launch site.
And we're getting all of this very critical information at a very low volume
over like a circa 1985 walkie talkie.
They do give us one final tip.
They said, listen, do not be alarmed when you don't hear the rocket.
The rocket is apparently so far away that we will see it first
and then the sound will wash over us.
I have this weird feeling like when you're in a chair and you tilt back
and you're about to fall and you pull yourself back.
It's that level of like fear and anticipation.
And I find myself hoping that whatever happens in the space business,
this moment never changes.
Five, four, three, two, one.
We have ignition.
I don't hear anything.
Vehicle is clear of the tower.
Unveils are disconnected.
Oh, whoa, whoa, it's so bright.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, it's shooting up so fast.
Oh, you can barely stare at it.
There's like a flame behind it.
Oh, my God.
Whoa, it's hard to look at it.
Attitude remains nominal at the caster 120.
Stage zero motor propels the 104 foot tall Minotaur C vehicle
away from Vandenberg Air Force Base.
That looked successful.
I don't know.
This was a really strange moment.
I mean, I was standing there holding a bottle of champagne.
We just watched a rocket shoot into the sky.
It seemed like everything had gone well,
but everyone is standing around the walkie talkie,
staring at the ground, looking like deadly serious, like heart attack
serious.
Because it's not about the rocket.
Everyone's waiting to hear about the satellites.
That's what everyone here paid for.
It's the most crucial part of the mission,
and it's about to happen.
Everybody's waiting.
Everybody's crowded around the walkie talkie.
Stage one TVA has been pressurized.
Stage zero has burned out.
So we're following along with this trying to sort of picture
what is happening right now in space.
And then that calm voice says something pretty terrifying.
And RSC, RSC, this is vehicle on countdown one.
We have negative telemetry in the center here at building 836.
Was just hoping you could confirm
the track of the vehicle via radar.
That means they've lost contact with it, I think.
Negative telemetry.
So we can't see the rocket anymore.
It's gone through the clouds.
It's up in the atmosphere somewhere.
And apparently, it has stopped sending data
back to mission control.
It's not communicating with mission control anymore.
It has stopped sending data back to Earth.
They don't know what's going on.
For some reason, I just keep looking up to the sky
like I'm going to see something before they do.
And once again, we have negative telemetry in the center.
It is so quiet.
And you can feel the tension in the air.
And then?
This is vehicle on countdown one.
We have recovered telemetry in the center.
We are now 230 seconds into the flight.
Are we in the clear?
I literally thought I was going to throw up
while that was happening.
I was already writing the end of the series in my mind.
And it was not a happy ending.
But even though we can't understand
what on Earth the man said,
it's clear that everything is back on track,
perfectly normal.
The covering at the top of the rocket has opened up.
And at this point, we're just listening for any mention
of the Planet Money satellite, Pod 1.
They do not call it by the name Pod 1.
The nickname on the launch chatter is Dove 3.
And so the greatest moment in Planet Money history
almost just goes by us.
It's so quick.
Expect a deployment of Doves 1 and 3.
That's it!
Let's do it!
All right.
Other people paid the money.
Other people did the work.
But we, we did the reporting. Cheers.
Cheers.
It must have been the good luck pancakes.
Well, we did it.
Somewhere up above the Earth
is a Cube satellite with our name on it.
That I've touched. It says Planet Money, Pod 1.
And there's a waveform of our voices on the side.
And if you could read it in space, whoever that would be,
it would say, hello and welcome to Planet Money.
The Planet Money satellite is official.
It is now circling the Earth.
Our producer, Elizabeth Kulas,
has been holding the microphone this whole time
through this incredibly tense moment,
recording everything, not saying a word.
And now you can tell she is a little bit choked up.
I'm kind of emotional.
I thought that was really beautiful.
I nearly started crying while I saw it.
I couldn't believe that human ingenuity could be so amazing.
I could just stand here all day looking at the sky,
thinking about what had just happened.
Imagining Pod 1.
But this is a military base
and they are already checking their watches
and pointing to the bus and being like,
Planet Money, time to go.
So we gather up our microphones
and the plastic champagne glasses.
And our goody bags and our newfound knowledge of space lingo.
It's been a nominal day.
Extremely nominal day.
And we walk back to the school bus and head home.
Meanwhile, 300 miles above our head.
A satellite is born and not a soul can see it.
90 minutes after launch,
Pod 1 makes its first full orbit of the Earth.
It whips over the North Pole at 17,000 miles per hour.
At this point, it's just a spinning box.
Picture a loaf of bread tumbling through the sky.
But somewhere in the first few hours,
it speaks for the first time.
It's just a ping that says, I'm here, I'm alive.
Over the next couple of weeks,
the computers that control Pod 1
try to stabilize the craft.
There are these little wheels
that spin inside of the satellite.
And each time you change the spin,
it nudges the satellite a little.
By mid-November, Pod 1 is stable
and its solar panels have unfolded.
It is a camera now, and it is pointed down at Earth.
And just this week, just in time to finish the series,
we get a call from Planet.
Our satellite has taken its first pictures.
This moment is called First Light.
First Light.
We were so excited.
Took a while to set up the conference call, though.
I'm now hearing an echo again.
Okay.
Is that because?
Technology.
You know, we can send a satellite to space, right?
I know, right, right.
Okay, so Stacey, Mike has sent us an email here
with a batch of photos.
Let me pull it up here.
It's the Earth.
This is the first thing that Pod 1 ever saw.
Oh my God, there it is.
It's like, it's like blue and white.
So the first strip of images
was collected over northeastern Russia.
Ah, like Siberia, Sakhalin, that kind of thing.
So somewhere under those clouds is Russia.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And those are just the first crappy photos.
First pancake?
It does, it does get better, look.
So the next image is in North Korea,
everyone's favorite place to zoom around in via satellite.
Oh, no way.
North Korea?
I have always wanted to see North Korea.
And there it is.
I think that is a runway.
And you can see mountains
and you can see this road here and some buildings.
And a big river.
There are little tiny boats on the river.
Oh, where has it?
It's already seen more of the world than I have.
We can see it all.
I feel like this is a cliche,
but the Earth looks really beautiful from 300 miles up.
It's really extraordinary to see the world in this way.
I've seen a lot of photos from space,
but these feel personal.
It's like when your toddler draws her first picture.
Oh.
But I better check with Mike.
Mike, how do these photos compare
with the other satellites you have?
This is pretty good.
I'm quite pleased with Pod 1's performance.
I feel like I knew Pod 1 was gifted.
When I was talking to the people who work at Planet,
they said one of the things they enjoyed
about this series was to see people excited
about satellites again.
I mean, they have almost 200 of them.
And Mike was telling me,
he just sort of thinks of it as a cloud of satellites
and not like a single miraculous thing.
I think that in some ways,
I think about it as commercial air travel.
It used to be a really big deal
when an airplane was flying.
And now it's just kind of like,
oh man, gotta get to New York
and the thing's 20 minutes late.
It's a sign of progress.
I don't know how to feel about that.
I know that's progress, but it's kind of sad.
Well, I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.
I don't wanna end this whole thing in sad way.
Give me an inspirational way for us to end this.
You have a satellite in space.
There's nothing to be sad about.
It is zooming around,
taking pictures of everywhere imaginable.
It's a satellite.
It's a satellite.
It's a satellite.

Hey, I just wanted to thank all of you,
the listeners, for sticking with us
through our space mission.
I sort of felt like we were doing it
on behalf of all of you.
So please send us an email.
Tell us what you thought.
planetmoney at npr.org
or you can find us on Twitter or Facebook.
We have been getting all of your emails
about a possible future mission for pod one
and we will have a follow-up episode in a few months
where we use our satellite to hopefully change the world.
For the better.
Didn't say that.
Today's episode was produced
by the wonderful Elizabeth Kules
who produced the entire space series
and made it happen.
Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer
and Bryant Urstadt is our editor.
Special thanks go to David Gerson
and Jordi Pushwari,
to Michael Stoneseifer
out at Vandenberg Air Force Base
who kept us on time and on mission.
And a special, special thanks to Trevor Hammond
and all of the people at Planet
who believed in us and let us adopt a satellite.
One of their company's missions
is to teach people about the world,
to make the world a smaller, better place.
And they were fantastic in allowing us
this view inside the small satellite industry
we would never have gotten otherwise.
So thanks to Planet.
And this whole adventure,
in fact all of Planet Money would not be possible
without the amazing support of NPR
and the amazing support of the member stations.
And so this month,
if you enjoyed the series and would like to hear more,
please think about giving to your local member station.

I'm Robert Smith.
And I'm Stacy Vanick Smith.
Thanks for listening.
One last thing, Stacy,
remember when I mentioned the space catalog?
Yes.
Here it is right here.
You'll notice at the top of the list,
at the top of the list is Sputnik.
That's awesome.
And let me go to the bottom of the list.
Right here.
Catalog number 42,996.
The 42,996th thing that ever went to space
is the Planet Money satellite.
Is that us?
That is us.
Robert Smith, we're official.
We're in the catalog, 42,996.
I'm Stacy Vanick Smith.
I'm Cardiff Garcia.
And we are here with a new show.
The Indicator.
It's three days a week.
It's about five minutes per show
and it is from the people who make Planet Money.
Mostly about work, business and the economy.
On every show,
we take some number in the news or a term or a story
and we dive into it to find the big idea behind it.
And what we really hope is that in every show.
Well look, at least almost every show.
We'll bring you a new idea.
Some new lens through which to see the world.
The Indicator of Planet Money.
