On today's show: stories about what happens when you actually read the fine print.

The fine print sends a Midwestern family on a two-thousand-mile road trip to open dozens of bank accounts.

It leads to a multi-million-dollar fight over the essence of the Snuggie. (Blanket? Or robe?)

And the fine print starts a fight over printer toner that goes all the way to the Supreme Court.

Also: cold beer. Via a loophole.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

Let's talk about cold beer in Indiana. I understand that's been a big part of your life lately.

JAY RICKER: Yeah, it has been.

GOLDSTEIN: This is Jay Ricker, runs a chain of convenience stores in Indiana called Ricker's, logically enough. And if he sounds kind of weary here, there's a reason. He's spent the last few months deep in the fine print of Indiana state law governing the sale of beer and wine.

RICKER: We can sell warm beer, cold wine. But we can't sell cold beer.

GOLDSTEIN: A lot of states have strange rules surrounding the sale of alcohol. In New York, for example, you can only buy wine at these little kind of neighborhood wine stores. In New Hampshire, you can only buy liquor at state-run stores. And in Indiana, there is a rule that you can sell cold beer in liquor stores and in restaurants, but not in convenience stores. And he thought, well, restaurants can sell cold beer. I got these little restaurants inside my stores. He dug into the fine print. And he, with the help of his lawyers, worked out a very precise way for his stores to sell cold beer.

RICKER: So you walk up to the counter, and you say I'd like to get a six-pack of beer. And so we card you, then we ring you up. Then we get it out of a cooler that's behind a counter that you can't go to. It can't be self-serve. That's a big no-no.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

RICKER: So we pull it out of there. We put it in a sack. We walk around the counter. We can't sit it on the counter and let you take it off the counter...

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

RICKER: ...Because that's considered running a bar.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

RICKER: And then you walk out the door after we hand it to you.

GOLDSTEIN: It's that easy. Ricker's started selling cold beer just a few weeks ago, and the Indiana liquor stores, the other places allowed to sell cold beer, didn't like it. They said Ricker's was, quote, "thumbing their noses" at the Indiana legislature.

RICKER: So I went to one of those legislators. And I said, hey, here's what we're doing, you know. And we have followed the law. And he admitted, yes, you have, but that's not the intent of the law. And we're going to change it.

GOLDSTEIN: Just this week Indiana Senate Bill 538 passed out of committee. If it becomes law, Ricker's will no longer be able to sell cold beer. This new law may also inadvertently ban other places from selling cold beer - bowling alleys, golf courses, which, of course, this is what always happens with fine print - unintended consequences. And the solution to those consequences - more fine print - finer, printier (ph) print.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARC WILLIAMS AND PATRICK STURROCK'S "WASTING AWAY")

GOLDSTEIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today on the show, the fine print - three stories about what happens when you actually read it. There's a nice Midwestern family with a tan minivan and a nationwide bank scheme, a high-stakes battle over the essence of the Snuggie. But first, a fight over fine print and printers that just made it to the Supreme Court.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARC WILLIAMS AND PATRICK STURROCK'S "WASTING AWAY")

GOLDSTEIN: Noel King.

NOEL KING, BYLINE: (Laughter) Jacob Goldstein.

GOLDSTEIN: Shall we start with the prop?

KING: Can we start with the prop? Yeah. So Jacob, this is a printer cartridge. This is the toner cartridge that goes inside your standard printer. And there is fine print on the outside of this toner cartridge box. And what the fine print basically says is if you open this box, you are entering into a contract, and you're giving up some of your rights. And the Supreme Court is now trying to settle an argument over this fine print. And depending on how this case is resolved, it is not just going to affect the price of your printer cartridge. It actually could have huge impacts on a lot of things that we buy, like electronics, like cars, like medicines - all because of the fine print on this printer cartridge.

GOLDSTEIN: I'm in.

KING: Can I tell you what happened?

GOLDSTEIN: Please.

KING: OK. This cartridge is made by a company called Lexmark.

GOLDSTEIN: Says that right here on the box.

KING: Yep. And Lexmark's business model is the standard printer business model. The printer itself is pretty cheap, but then when you need to buy a new ink cartridge, that is where they get you. This cartridge costs $130.

GOLDSTEIN: And it's just ink.

KING: It's just ink. Yes. And people don't want to pay $130 every time they buy a cartridge.

GOLDSTEIN: For ink.

KING: Yes. So there are these smaller third-party companies that find and buy empty printer cartridges, refill them with their own ink...

GOLDSTEIN: I love it so much.

KING: ...And then they'll sell it to you for, like, half the price. Instead of $130, they'll sell you a refilled cartridge, a used cartridge, for $65.

GOLDSTEIN: Fantastic.

KING: Fantastic - right? - for these small companies, fantastic for you and me...

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

KING: ...Fantastic for everybody except Lexmark.

GOLDSTEIN: The company that is selling cheap printers so that they can sell expensive ink.

KING: That's exactly it.

GOLDSTEIN: It basically destroys their business model.

KING: So there's this little company that's in the business of refilling toner cartridges. It's like 25 people in West Virginia. And Lexmark is suing that company.

GOLDSTEIN: Suing them - what is their argument?

KING: The answer lies in the fine print on this box.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

KING: I'm picking up the box of toner. OK?

GOLDSTEIN: You literally are doing that.

KING: It's a large box. It's heavy.

GOLDSTEIN: Can you shake it or something?

KING: I can. But I'm not going to open it for reasons which I'll divulge in just a second.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDSTEIN: Suspense - you're using narrative tricks on me, and they're working.

KING: (Laughter) Now, on the side of this toner box...

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

KING: ...From Lexmark, it says the following - (reading) opening this package or using the patented cartridge inside confirms your acceptance of the following license/agreement.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. So I'm just going to stop you there. So they're saying if you open this box, you're agreeing to this deal.

KING: That's right.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. And what is the deal?

KING: Here's what you're agreeing to. The patented toner cartridge is sold at a special price subject to a patent restriction that it may be used only once. One time - that's it.

GOLDSTEIN: Aha - buy this, use it, but you cannot sell it or give it to that little company that takes our cartridges and resells them. That is not allowed. You're making a deal when you open this box, and that deal prohibits you from doing that.

KING: Yes. That is Lexmark's argument. Now, here is the other side. Here's the argument being made by the small company. There is a legal term called patent exhaustion.

GOLDSTEIN: Patent exhaustion.

KING: Yes. What it means is if you, Jacob Goldstein, go into a store and buy something...

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

KING: ...If it's - even if it's patented, once you have bought it, it now belongs to you. The company that holds the patent can't tell you what to do with it. Their rights are exhausted.

GOLDSTEIN: Their patent rights on the product are exhausted once I buy it.

KING: Yes. And you can do whatever you want.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. So that's why I can, say, buy a computer and then turn around and sell it to somebody else. Because once I buy it, I own it. I can do what I want with it.

KING: Bingo. But there's a legal exception to patent exhaustion which says you can do what Lexmark is doing. You can say, no, no, no, don't refill my stuff, don't reuse my stuff, as long as you put it on the product itself. As long as you write it in fine print on this item, you can't resell this, you can't resell this. And that's what this big argument is about.

GOLDSTEIN: So when you put it that way, it seems like, oh, OK. The law is in Lexmark's favor. But, you know, the Supreme Court doesn't take that many cases. And so the fact that they took it tells me, A, it must be more complicated than it sounds and, B, there must be some larger thing at stake, right? 'Cause that's what the Supreme Court does.

KING: Right. There are actually huge stakes here for a lot of companies and for a lot of products. And you can see that in the fact that many, many, many big companies like Costco and LG Electronics have filed amicus briefs on behalf of the little company in West Virginia doing the refills.

Because all of those big companies, they sell you stuff with patented parts all the time. These companies want a world where they can sell you something, and you're free and clear. You can do what you want with it.

There is one last twist here.

GOLDSTEIN: A twist.

KING: A twist, yeah. OK. There's this other brief floating around on behalf of Lexmark. It's signed by a bunch of business professors, economics professors, law professors. And what they say and what Lexmark says is Lexmark actually offers two different versions of this toner cartridge. There's the one with the fine print on it. There is also another version that is more expensive, but you can do whatever you want with it.

GOLDSTEIN: No fine print.

KING: No fine print.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

KING: So the concern is if Lexmark loses this case, it will no longer be in its interest to bother making the cheaper version. And you and me and everybody else could end up paying even higher prices for these new toner cartridges.

GOLDSTEIN: If we're buying them from Lexmark. But maybe it'll get easier to get the cheap refilled cartridges. But then if we're all buying cheap refilled cartridges, maybe they won't sell the printer for cheap anymore in the first place, so the printer will get more expensive.

(SOUNDBITE OF ROBERT J. WALSH'S "THE HUSTLER")

GOLDSTEIN: Money's got to come from somewhere.

KING: (Laughter) Money's got to come from somewhere.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, Noel.

KING: Thank - you're welcome.

GOLDSTEIN: Next up - a road trip.

(SOUNDBITE OF ROBERT J. WALSH'S "THE HUSTLER")

GOLDSTEIN: What's the first - can you tell me the first entry in the first journal?

AMY: All right. So we - August 9, 1998. We departed at 8:22 Central Standard Time (laughter) - kind of a nerd.

GOLDSTEIN: This is Amy (ph).

AMY: Mileage - 10,518 on the tan van.

GOLDSTEIN: She's an accountant. Her husband is also an accountant.

AMY: We got to Ohio at 2:28. And gas was 81 cents.

GOLDSTEIN: And in the summer of 1998, they took their two young kids on a road trip.

AMY: We got to Youngstown around 6:30. The hotel, Comfort Inn, was no great establishment.

GOLDSTEIN: Day 2.

AMY: Up early for everyone. Our first bank was in Greenville, Pa., about 45 minutes away. We found it with no trouble, and the people were very efficient. We were on our way in 20 minutes.

GOLDSTEIN: It was the second day of their big road trip, and Amy and her husband Dave (ph) had just opened a savings account.

AMY: Our next stop was in Hollidaysburg. What a cute downtown. We headed from there to Mount Olive - another blinding rain. It was a mad dash from there to Milton (ph). These are all bank stops.

GOLDSTEIN: They're like reverse bank robbers - going from bank to bank to bank and putting money into each one, opening one savings account after another.

AMY: We got to Milton in time, but couldn't find the bank - oh, yeah, that was it - until it had been closed for five minutes. We left info in the night depository, and we'll see what happens.

GOLDSTEIN: Amy and Dave were opening all these bank accounts because they wanted to make money off the fine print. A few years before the road trip, Dave had started opening accounts at little banks all around where they lived. These banks were a particular kind of bank called mutual banks. Mutual banks are owned by people with accounts at the bank. You can think of it like a co-op bank.

And back at this time - back in the '90s - a lot of these banks were converting from being mutual banks to being just like regular banks - banks with stock that trades on the stock market. And here's the fine print part. Under federal regulations, people who had accounts at the mutual bank got first crack at the stock. And the stock almost always went up.

So Dave goes around his town, opens all these accounts. And sure enough, a little while later, he got a letter from one of the banks. It was converting to become a regular bank, and he could be first in line to buy the stock.

DAVE: So I sent money in. It wasn't a lot of money - sent it in, got the shares. And the shares went up. And I said, well, this is pretty cool.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter).

DAVE: And I said, well, there must be more mutuals in the country. And so...

(LAUGHTER)

DAVE: So I scouted around and found a company that was selling a list. And so I bought the list.

GOLDSTEIN: They got some maps from AAA, covered them with little yellow Post-it Notes on all the banks they were going to hit. And then - banking road trip.

AMY: We were always, you know, honest. We don't live here. We live in the Midwest. But you felt like, when you walked out with that passbook - when he walked out with that passbook, we'd won.

GOLDSTEIN: They drove north from Pennsylvania into New England, opening bank accounts along the way. Also, they had a vacation. They went whale watching, watched a game at Fenway Park, went for hikes in the mountains. By the time they got home, they'd driven more than 2,000 miles and opened accounts at 23 banks. And then, they waited.

The way this thing works, you don't know when or even if any particular mutual bank is going to convert, is going to have an IPO. Some of the banks where Amy and Dave opened accounts on that trip almost 20 years ago are still plugging away as mutual banks. But others did have IPOs, did sell stock. Dave and Amy bought shares, and they almost never lost money.

DAVE: Yeah, it's rare. I think I probably lost money on three out of 60 that I've done.

GOLDSTEIN: In other words, he made a profit 57 out of 60 times. The family went on more road trips, opened more accounts - more than 300 in all. Dave and Amy didn't want to talk about exactly how much money they've made on this. In fact, they asked me not to use their last name. They said they haven't told many people about their bank thing. They still live in the same house they've always lived in, still drive an old van. But clearly, this has been good to them.

This trick, this way they figured out to profit from the fine print, it seems to be winding down now. Nobody's starting new mutual banks anymore. There aren't that many left. Still, Amy and Dave's daughter Sarah (ph), who is now also an accountant, told me there may still be a little action left.

SARAH: Last December, I had a little time off, and I made a road trip by myself to Boston and looped around Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York. There aren't many left that'll take you.

GOLDSTEIN: Wait, you made this trip to do it, to open accounts?

SARAH: I visited some friends along the way.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDSTEIN: Did they know that you weren't really there to see them?

SARAH: No, they had no idea.

(LAUGHTER)

SARAH: I'm so sorry, if they hear this.

GOLDSTEIN: Sarah opened 11 accounts in all. She hasn't made any money off of them yet. In a minute, a story about the meaning of a Snuggie.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDSTEIN: Kenny Malone, how are you doing?

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

I'm good. I've been in the weeds on something that maybe you know about. Are you familiar with the Snuggie?

GOLDSTEIN: Sure. I watch TV. It's like a blanket with holes in it.

MALONE: Yeah, the idea is that a normal blanket slips off and it's very hard to stick your arms through a normal blanket to grab the remote, and therefore a blanket with sleeves is the solution. And so here we are with a dispute about what the Snuggie is. Is it a blanket, or is it like a piece of clothing?

GOLDSTEIN: Like a robe.

MALONE: Yeah. And this is an important distinction. There are millions of dollars on the line. And to get to the bottom of this, I visited a lawyer named Joe Spraragen, who somebody told me had an office full of Snuggies. But by the time I got to his office and time I met him, he walked me inside...

JOE SPRARAGEN: The last - I'm down to one.

MALONE: What?

SPRARAGEN: Breaking open the Snuggie package. Here we see one lovely brown snugly.

MALONE: So Joe represents the company that sells Snuggie in this dispute, Allstar Marketing.

I'm going to wear this for the rest of the interview, if that's all right with you.

SPRARAGEN: I prefer the term use it, rather than wear it.

MALONE: Oh, I see what you're doing here.

GOLDSTEIN: What is he doing here?

MALONE: OK, here's what's going on there. There is a fight over where the Snuggie falls in something called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.

GOLDSTEIN: I love the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. It's like the finest of fine print. It's this giant book where they try and classify every single object that you could theoretically ever import.

MALONE: There's live foxes - 4.8% tariff in there.

GOLDSTEIN: If I want to import a live fox.

MALONE: Mmm hmm. Walking sticks - 4.0% tariff.

GOLDSTEIN: You're just doing this off the top of your head. You're like a...

MALONE: Coffee - 0% tariff. I got this thing down. So Joe and the company that sells the Snuggie, they claim that the Snuggie would fall under Section 6301.40.00...

GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

MALONE: ...Blankets and travelling rugs from synthetic fiber.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

MALONE: Tariff of 8.5%.

GOLDSTEIN: So Snuggie wants it to be a blanket. And obviously, you don't wear a blanket, which is why this lawyer is playing this game of he wants you to say use, not wear.

MALONE: That's exactly right. But the United States government says, come on, you do wear a Snuggie, and therefore it should fall under Section 6114.30.30 - other garments, knitted or crocheted, of manmade fiber, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

GOLDSTEIN: So they're saying it's a garment. It's something you wear.

MALONE: Right. Like, it would fall in the same category as maybe a graduation gown or, like, a priestly cloak or whatever.

GOLDSTEIN: And I'm going to guess that if it's a garment, it's taxed at a higher rate than if it's a blanket.

MALONE: Fourteen-point-nine percent.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. So it's like about 15% versus 8.5% - a big difference.

MALONE: Big difference.

GOLDSTEIN: So Snuggie says it's a blanket, 8.5%, the government says it's kind of like a robe, 15%. What is it?

MALONE: This battle recently went before the U.S. Court of international trade. Both parties argued their sides. And the U.S. Court decided, yeah, this thing is a blanket. There's no...

GOLDSTEIN: It's a blanket. Snuggie won.

MALONE: Snuggie wins. But the government is probably going to appeal.

GOLDSTEIN: Of course. Somebody is always going to appeal. So this story is absurd on its face, which is kind of the essence of fine print, right? It's the sort of silly details to a ridiculous degree. But, you know, we have a world where we have different tax rates for every possible thing that somebody could import. And so the only thing that could happen in that world is you wind up with lawyers in court arguing over whether a blanket with holes in it is actually not a blanket but a robe. I mean, fine print exists for a reason. Fine print exists because the world is in fact not as simple as we want it to be. We need fine print.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) Snuggie, Snuggie - everyone agrees. There's only one Snuggie, the blanket that has sleeves. Snuggie, Snuggie...

GOLDSTEIN: Special thanks today to Sarah and Jack. Those were the two young kids sitting in the back of the van while their parents drove around the country opening bank accounts. They grew up to be Planet Money listeners, and they told me about their story.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDSTEIN: Send your story ideas to us at planetmoney@npr.org, or you can also find us on Facebook or Twitter.

MALONE: And today's episode was edited by Bryant Urstadt. It was produced by Nick Fountain, with an assist from Sally Helm. And if you're looking for another podcast to listen to, try Fresh Air with Terry Gross.

GOLDSTEIN: Fresh Air. It's the radio show, except it's a podcast. You can listen to it anytime you want. You can find it at npr.org/podcasts, on the NPR One app or wherever you get your podcasts.

MALONE: And thanks for sharing your podcast recommendations this month as part of trypod. If you have any more recommendations, you can still do it, even though the month is probably over. T-R-Y-P-O-D - trypod.

GOLDSTEIN: I'm Jacob Goldstein.

Let's talk about cold beer in Indiana. I understand that's been a big part of your life lately
Yeah, it has been this is Jay ricker runs a chain of convenience stores in Indiana called Rickers logically enough
And if he sounds kind of weary here, there's a reason he spent the last few months deep in the fine print of Indiana
State law governing the sale of beer and wine. We can sell warm beer

If it becomes law Rickers will no longer be able to sell cold beer
This new law may also inadvertently ban other places from selling cold beer bowling alleys golf courses
Which of course, this is what always happens with fine print unintended consequences
And the solution to those consequences more fine print finer print your print
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Jacob Goldstein today on the show the fine print three stories about what happens when you actually read
There's a nice Midwestern family with a tan minivan and a nationwide bank scheme a high-stakes battle over the essence of the Snuggie
But first a fight over fine print and printers that just made it to the Supreme Court
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our sponsors State Farm

Noel King
Jacob Goldstein, shall we start with the prop? Can we start with the prop? Yeah, so Jacob?
This is a a printer cartridge
This is the the toner cartridge that goes inside your standard
printer and there is fine print on the outside of this toner cartridge box and what the fine print basically says is if
You open this box you are entering into a contract and you're giving up some of your rights and
The Supreme Court is now trying to settle an argument over this fine print and depending on how this case is resolved
It is not just going to affect the price of your printer cartridge
It actually could have huge impacts on a lot of things that we buy like
Electronics like cars like medicines all because of the fine print on this printer cartridge
I'm in can I tell you what happened, please?
Okay, this cartridge is made by a company called Lexmark
So is that right here on the box?
Yeah, and Lexmark's business model is the standard printer business model. The printer itself is pretty cheap
But then when you need to buy a new ink cartridge, that is where they get you this cartridge costs
$130 and it's just ink. It's just ink. Yes, and people don't want to pay $130 every time they buy a cartridge for ink
Yes, so there are these smaller third-party companies that find and buy empty printer cartridges
Refill them with their own. I love it so much and then they'll sell it to you for like half the price instead of
$130 they'll sell you a refilled cartridge a used cartridge for $65 fantastic fantastic right for these small companies
fantastic for you and me
Fantastic for everybody except Lexmark the company that is selling cheap printers so that they can sell expensive ink
That's exactly it basically destroys their business model. So there's this little company that's in the business of refilling toner cartridges
It's like 25 people in West Virginia and Lexmark is suing that company suing them
What what is their argument? The answer lies in the fine print on this box? Okay, I'm picking up the box of toner
It's a large box. It's heavy and I'm shake it or something. I can't but I'm not gonna open it for reasons
Which I'll divulge in just a second
Suspense narrative tricks on me and they're working now on the side of this toner box from Lexmark
It says the following
Opening this package or using the patented cartridge inside confirms your acceptance of the following license slash agreement
Okay, so I'm just gonna stop you there. So they're saying if you open this box, you're agreeing to this deal
That's right. Okay. And what is the deal?
Here's what you're agreeing to the patented toner cartridge is sold at a special price subject to a patent restriction
That it may be used only once one time
By this use it but you cannot sell it or give it to that little company that that takes our cartridges and resells them
That is not allowed you're making a deal when you open this box and that deal prohibits you from doing that
Yes, that is Lexmark's argument
Now here is the other side. Here's the argument being made by the small company
There is a legal term called patent exhaustion patent exhaustion. Yes
What it means is if you Jacob Goldstein go into a store and buy something if it's even if it's patented once you have bought it
It now belongs to you the company that holds the patent
Can't tell you what to do it that their rights are exhausted their patent rights on the product are exhausted once I buy it
Yes, and you can do whatever you want
Okay
so that's why I can say by a
Computer and then turn around and sell it to somebody else because once I buy it I own it I can do what I
Bingo, but there's a legal exception to patent exhaustion, which says you can do what Lexmark is doing
You can say no. No. No, don't refill my stuff
Don't reuse my stuff as long as you put it on the product itself as long as you write it in fine print on
This item you can't resell this you can't resell this and that's what this big argument is about
So when you put it that way, it seems like oh, okay
The law is in Lexmark's favor, but you know, the Supreme Court doesn't take that many cases
And so the fact that they took it tells me a it must be more complicated than it sounds and B
There must be some larger thing at stake right because that's what the Supreme Court does, right?
There are actually huge stakes here for a lot of companies and for a lot of products and you can see that in
The fact that many many many big companies like Costco and LG
Electronics have filed amicus briefs on behalf of the little company in West Virginia doing the refills
Because all of those big companies they sell you stuff with patented parts all the time
These companies want a world where they can sell you something and you're free and clear you can do what you want with it

Even higher prices for these new toner cartridges if we're buying them from Lexmark
But maybe it'll get easier to get that cheap refilled cartridges
But then if we're all buying cheap refilled cartridges, maybe they won't sell the printer for cheap anymore in the first place
So the printer will get more expensive
When he's gotta come from somewhere
Thanks Noel. Thank you. Welcome. Next up the road trip. What's the first?
Can you tell me the first entry in the first journal? All right, so we
August 9th 1998 we departed at 822 Central Standard Time kind of a nerd
This is Amy mileage 10,000 518 on the tan van. She's an accountant
Her husband is also an accountant. We got to Ohio at 228 and gas was 81 cents
And in the summer of 1998, they took their two young kids on a road trip
We got to Youngstown around 630 the hotel Comfort Inn was no great establishment
They too up early for everyone. Our first bank was in Greenville, Pennsylvania about 45 minutes away
We found it with no trouble and the people were very efficient. We were on our way in 20 minutes
It was the second day of their big road trip and Amy and her husband Dave had just opened a savings account
Our next stop was in Holidaysburg. What a cute downtown
We headed from there to Mount Olive another blinding rain. It was a mad dash from there to Milton
These are all bank stops
They're like reverse bank robbers going from bank to bank to bank and putting money into each one
Opening one savings account after another we got to Milton in time, but couldn't find the bank
Oh, yeah, that was it until it had been closed for five minutes
We left info in the night depository and we'll see what happens
Amy and Dave were opening all these bank accounts because they wanted to make money off the fine print a few years before the
Road trip David started opening accounts at little banks all around where they lived
These banks were a particular kind of bank called mutual banks
Mutual banks are owned by people with accounts at the bank
You can think of it like a like a co-op bank and back at this time back in the 90s a lot of these
banks were converting from being mutual banks to being just like regular banks banks with stock that trades on the stock market and
Here's the fine print part under federal regulations people who had accounts at the mutual banks
Got first crack at the stock and the stock almost always went up
So Dave goes around his town opens all these accounts and sure enough a little while later
He got a letter from one of the banks
It was converting to become a regular bank and he could be first in line to buy the stock
So I sent money in
Wasn't a lot of money sent it in got the shares and the shares went up and I said well
This is pretty cool
And I said well there must be more mutuals in the country
So I scouted around and found a company that was selling a list and so I bought the list
They got some maps from AAA covered them with little yellow post-it notes on all the banks
They were gonna hit and then banking road trip. We were always you know, honest
We don't live here. We live in the Midwest
But you felt like when you walked out with that passbook when he walked out with that passbook
We'd won they drove north from Pennsylvania into New England opening bank accounts along the way
Also, they had a vacation they went whale-watching watched a game at Fenway Park
Went for hikes in the mountains by the time they got home
They'd driven more than 2,000 miles and opened accounts at 23 banks
And then they waited the way this thing works
You don't know when or even if any particular mutual bank is gonna convert is gonna have an IPO
Some of the banks where Amy and Dave opened accounts on that trip almost 20 years ago are still plugging away as mutual banks
But others did have IPOs did sell stock Dave and Amy bought shares and they almost never lost money. Yeah, it's rare
I think I probably lost money on three out of sixty that I've done in other words
He made a profit 57 out of 60 times
The family went on more road trips open more accounts more than 300 in all
Dave and Amy didn't want to talk about exactly how much money they've made on this
In fact, they asked me not to use their last name
They said they haven't told many people about their bank thing. They still live in the same house
They've always lived in still drive an old van, but clearly this has been good to them
This trick this way they figured out to profit from the fine print. It seems to be winding down now
Nobody's starting new mutual banks anymore. There aren't that many left still Amy and Dave's daughter Sarah
Who is now also an accountant told me there may still be a little action left last December
I had a little time off and I made a road trip by myself to Boston and
Looped around Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York. There aren't many left that uh, wait
I don't take you made this trip to do it to open accounts
I visited some friends along the way did they know that you weren't really there to see them
Sarah opened 11 accounts in all
She hasn't made any money off of them yet in a minute a story about the meaning of a snuggie

Kenny Malone, how you doing? I'm good. I've been in the weeds on something that maybe you know about are you familiar with the snuggie?
Sure, I watch TV. Mm-hmm. It's like a blanket with holes in it
Yeah, the idea the idea is that a normal blanket slips off and it's very hard to stick your arms through a normal blanket to grab
The remote and therefore a blanket with sleeves is the solution
And so here we are with a dispute about what the snuggie is
Is it a blanket or is it like a piece of clothing like a robe?
Yeah, and this is this is an important distinction
There are millions of dollars on the line and to get to the bottom of this
I visited a lawyer named Joe Sprerigan who somebody told me had an office full of snuggies
But by the time I got to his office and time I met him he walked me inside
The last I'm down to one what?
Breaking open the snuggie package
See one lovely brown snuggie. So Joe represents the company that sells snuggie in this dispute all-star marketing
I'm just gonna wear this for the rest of the interview if that's alright with you
I prefer the term use it rather than wear it. Oh, I see what you're doing here
What is he doing here? Okay. Here's what's going on there
There's a fight over where the snuggie falls in something called the harmonized tariff schedule. I love the harmonized tariff schedule
It's like the finest of fine print
It's this it's this giant book where they try and classify every single object that you could theoretically ever import
There's if the live Fox's
4.8 percent tariff in there if I want to import a live Fox walking sticks 4.0 percent tariff
Just doing this off the top of your head. You're like a coffee zero percent tariff. I got this thing down
So Joe and the company that sells the snuggie they they claim that the snuggie would fall under section
630 1.4 0.00 sure blankets and traveling rugs from synthetic fiber
Tariff of 8.5 percent. So snuggie wants it to be a blanket and obviously you don't wear a blanket
Which is why this lawyer is playing this game of he wants to say use not wear
That's exactly right
But the United States government says come on you do wear a snuggie and therefore it should fall under section 6 1 1 4 point 3 0
0.3 0 other garments knitted or crocheted of man-made fiber, etc, etc, etc
So they're saying it's a garment
It's something you wear right like it would fall in the same category as maybe a graduation gown or like a
Priestley cloak or whatever and I'm gonna guess that if it's a garment
It's taxed at a higher rate than if it's a blanket 14.9 percent
Okay, so it's like about 15 percent versus eight and a half percent a big difference big difference
So snuggie says it's a blanket eight and a half percent. The government says it's kind of like a robe 15 percent
What is it? This battle recently went before the US Court of International Trade
Both parties argued their sides and the US court decided
Yeah, this thing is a blanket. There's a blanket snuggie one snuggie wins
But the government is probably going to appeal of course somebody's always going to appeal
So this story is
Absurd on its face
Which is kind of the essence of fine print, right? It's the sort of silly details to a ridiculous degree
But you know, we have a world where we have different tax rates for every possible thing that somebody could import
And so the only thing that can happen in that world is you wind up with lawyers in court
Arguing over whether a blanket with holes in it is actually not a blanket but a robe
I mean fine print exists for a reason fine print exists because the world is in fact
Not as simple as we want it to be
We need fine print
