Three short stories about putting a price on something hard to value precisely. We go from $4.66 under a pillow all the way up to $1 trillion across every inch of highway in America.

Hiding inside each price tag is a messy tangle of information. How much did this cost to make? How much will someone pay to have it? What else can they buy with that money? What did it cost last year?

We bring you three stories untangling a price tag, three stories of setting a value on something when it isn't so easy to slap on a price tag.

    We try to figure out what $1 trillion means, because that's what Donald Trump says he wants to spend on infrastructure. We'll tell you what $1 trillion can buy, and two caveats about Trump's plan.
    We pause to appreciate the dollar value of an Oxford comma, which may just be worth $10 million in a lawsuit about overtime.
    And we venture into tooth fairy economics. The amount left under kids' pillows is an overlooked economic indicator. We bring you the hard numbers, and the story of when a meeting of the White House economics team helped settle on the right price per tooth.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

There's a hard and fast rule in radio, and maybe you've noticed this. The rule is don't use numbers. Don't use very many numbers because the idea is you're listening to this and, actually, probably doing something. You're walking somewhere, working out, doing the dishes. And it gets confusing if I say, nine, five, six, six, two, one, four, five, two because you have no idea what I just said. So that's the rule.

But today, I'm going to reveal a secret. I actually love to hear numbers on the radio. It's a sort of like rhythm-poetry thing. Like, I could listen to numbers - and I do - for hours. In fact, sometimes in the morning, I will listen to Bloomberg Business radio. Drives my family nuts. But I just let the numbers wash over me.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Let's check in on how the markets are trading. The Dow is down by 65 points, the S&P lower by 0.4 percent. The NASDAQ is trading down by one-tenth of one percent. In the bond markets, you're seeing some buying going on in treasuries, that yield coming down about three basis points - 2.72 percent is where the yield is on the 10-year note.

SMITH: And yeah, afterwards, I do not remember any of those numbers. But, you know, I can feel the numbers. And it makes me feel like someone has measured something, calculated something, taken a note of a particular moment.

Every number has a story. And so today on the show, we're going to break the radio rules and just take a sheer delight in numbers - three numbers in particular - three price tags. Give me the big sound.

(SOUNDBITE OF CLOSING BELL)

SMITH: Ba-da-dum (ph), ba-da-dum, ba-da-dum. One trillion dollars, $10 million and $4.66. The trillion dollars represents the dream for America. Ten million dollars is the price of a single punctuation mark. And $4.66 - that number involves a magical fairy that visits in the middle of the night.

SMITH: Oh, I'm Robert Smith. This is PLANET MONEY.

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY AND SKINNY WILLIAMS' "CHECKERBOARD KICKS")

SMITH: On the show we're going to talk about what different things cost, starting with the very small and cheap to the inconceivably expensive. So let's just start with a handful of change.

(SOUNDBITE OF COINS FALLING)

SMITH: This right here - around a dollar and change - was what I used to get when I was a child for a tooth placed underneath my pillow at night from the tooth fairy.

Now, I didn't think much about how much I got, just I wanted a lot of coins. But now that I'm a father, like, this has actually been a discussion I had late into the night. How much should a child get for a single tooth from the tooth fairy? And the more you think about it, the more you realize this is an overlooked economic indicator. So we brought in reporter Kenny Malone to tell us - one tooth, one child - how much is it worth?

KENNY MALONE, BYLINE: I have an answer, $4.66

SMITH: That's very specific.

MALONE: Boom.

SMITH: Four dollars and 66 cents. And we know this how?

MALONE: We know this because there is strikingly good data on what people are giving their kids for teeth.

SMITH: Done by the tooth industry or the dental industry?

MALONE: It is big tooth. Well, let's call it big tooth. Every year for just about the last 20 years, Delta Dental, the insurance company, has been conducting the tooth fairy poll, a nationally representative survey. And currently, a tooth is pulling in $4.66.

SMITH: So $4.66 on average.

MALONE: Which is more than I got as a kid.

SMITH: Yeah, me, too.

MALONE: And, Robert, the more I looked into this, the more I realized that there is something very strange going on with the tooth fairy right now. This sounds a little silly, but I can give you an example of just how serious this can get.

Let me set a scene for you. It's the Obama White House. Members of the economic team - they're in the West Wing. They're sitting around a table. Brilliant economists, including Betsey Stevenson, who was a member of his Council of Economic Advisers.

BETSEY STEVENSON: We are sitting around the table waiting for Jack Lew, the treasury secretary, to walk over. And honestly, I can't even tell you what the meeting was about.

MALONE: Well, we know what it became about, don't we?

STEVENSON: (Laughter).

MALONE: She's laughing because what it became about was a sort of national economic consensus on what the tooth fairy should pay Betsey Stevenson's daughter for a tooth.

SMITH: I'm guessing first child.

MALONE: First kid, first tooth.

STEVENSON: And I think she had lost it that morning.

MALONE: It was a crisis. So she turns to the room. And she says does anyone know what the tooth fairy is paying these days? And the room lights up. Even people without kids start jumping in with their ideas. Betsy Stevenson, her approach is, well, what did the tooth fairy give me as a kid? Fifty cents.

SMITH: I'm guessing mid-'70s or so.

MALONE: Yeah, mid-'70s. And fifty cents doesn't buy what it used to. So the question is can we adjust that for inflation? This is a room full of our nation's top economists.

SMITH: They can do it.

MALONE: Betsy just figures it out. What is 50 cents from the '70s worth now?

STEVENSON: An inflation-adjusted number might put you something closer to $3 a tooth.

MALONE: Three dollars a tooth. That's the inflated number. But she asks the other economists what are your kids actually getting? And they say...

STEVENSON: Five to $20.

MALONE: Whoa.

SMITH: Some kid got $20 for a tooth?

MALONE: There's general consensus that probably the tooth fairy didn't have any change on that particular night.

SMITH: (Laughter) That does happen. But in all seriousness though - I mean, as serious as this particular story can get - I'm looking here at that study that you gave me about the average tooth fairy gift. And it is going up faster than inflation, faster than you might think it would.

MALONE: Yeah. And this, Robert, this is the mystery. Over the last 10 years, according to that Delta Dental study we were looking at, the price of a tooth has skyrocketed. Dental inflation, let's call it, has averaged over 10 percent per year.

SMITH: Which it never does anywhere in the economy.

MALONE: Inflation - that's an insane number. And so I figured we needed an expert to get to the bottom of this.

ALAN BLINDER: Yep. This is Alan Blinder, professor of economics at Princeton University.

SMITH: He must have loved getting this call.

MALONE: So Alan Blinder's not just some economist. In the 1990s, he was vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board. And as you know, Robert, one of the most important jobs of the Fed is to monitor inflation.

SMITH: And keep it low.

MALONE: And keep it low. And I explained to him that teeth had been going up at this crazy rate, around 10 percent per year.

BLINDER: Teeth, you say?

MALONE: Yeah, teeth.

BLINDER: I can't think of anything that's gone up at 10 percent.

MALONE: And for comparison, he said actual inflation over the last decade...

BLINDER: Must be right around 2 percent.

SMITH: Two percent. So, I mean, I guess the obvious question is what is so special about a tooth that makes it go up so rapidly?

MALONE: That was the question that I had. And I thought maybe we could find an answer in the way we calculate inflation. That 2 percent number, that's the inflation for everything, everything from fuel to bananas to a house. And that's not stuff kids buy. They only care about a tiny little section of that.

So one theory I had was what if we asked kids, what do you actually care about? And maybe that stuff has gotten more expensive at a really high rate. Broad strokes of what these kids around New York said - toys, electronics and candy.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Nerf gun.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Ice cream.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: Rock 'n' roll guitar.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #4: Pokemon cards.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #5: Fruit snacks.

MALONE: Alan Blinder said actually a lot of that stuff has gotten cheaper over the last decade.

SMITH: Sure because toys are manufactured overseas in China. Electronics are way more powerful. You can put chips into anything. And stuff just gets cheaper.

MALONE: Yeah. And so by economic logic, maybe the tooth fairy should actually be bringing less than a decade ago.

BLINDER: Yeah. I think the kids are making out like bandits here.

MALONE: Do you think an intervention is necessary from your...

BLINDER: No. I wouldn't efficate (ph) government intervention.

SMITH: So the mystery deepens. It's not like kids are getting more money for more stuff. Then what explains that $20 bill?

MALONE: Yeah. This is the question that I took to my final economist, Justin Wolfers, who's a professor at the University of Michigan.

JUSTIN WOLFERS: If you want to work some economic jargon into this, economists talk about something called the income elasticity of demand.

MALONE: We do want to work some economic jargon into this.

SMITH: We definitely want to talk about the income elasticity of demand. Go.

MALONE: So let's say that you get a raise - 10 percent. If all of a sudden you started making 10 percent more, that doesn't mean that you're going to suddenly spend 10 percent more on every single part of your life. You're not going to spend 10 percent more necessarily on food, for example. But there are these categories of things that we might spend more than 10 percent more on now that we have the money. And Wolfers suspects that children are one of those things we like to splurge on.

WOLFERS: And so it doesn't surprise me to hear that the tooth fairy has outpaced inflation because the tooth fairy is one of those vehicles with which we give more to our kids.

MALONE: One more thing about Justin Wolfers. So you remember at the beginning of this we talked about the White House, the tooth fairy summit.

SMITH: Betsey Stevenson, the economist.

MALONE: Yes. Justin Wolfers is her partner. That kid who lost her tooth, that's Justin's daughter.

SMITH: So together they figured it out.

STEVENSON: We're a family that - we take in data. And the median seems to be a great place to be. And that's exactly where our family was with the tooth fairy. We're at $5.

SMITH: Five dollars. I feel like my kids have never gotten $5.

MALONE: But, Robert, that is the going rate, man.

SMITH: I just can't do it.

MALONE: Does it make you a bad father?

SMITH: I'm sorry, I can't help it. I think of it as pocket full of change.

MALONE: I think of it as change, too, but this particular argument always ends up with being back in my day, I walked uphill three ways to get my tooth fairy money. I just feel like you can't talk about this without just sounding like a super old person.

SMITH: (Laughter) All right, $5 it is.

MALONE: Five dollars.

SMITH: Kenny Malone, one of the newest correspondents for PLANET MONEY. Thank you, sir.

MALONE: Thank you. Do we thank? Is that a thing we do?

SMITH: You're welcome.

MALONE: You're welcome.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL HOLTER AND MIKE STANDAL'S "EVERYDAY A MISTAKE")

SMITH: All right, let's take a huge leap from pocket change to our next number.

NOEL KING, BYLINE: Ten million. Ten million dollars.

SMITH: Ten million dollars. That is the voice of Noel King, who has the story of a very unusual court case.

KING: Yes. It is a group of dairy truck drivers up in Maine who are suing their bosses for unpaid overtime. These guys were working long days - 12, 16 hours. Their bosses were only paying them for eight. So they say, you owe us a bunch of money.

SMITH: So far a very normal case.

KING: Yes. This court case hinges on a comma that is in a statute - or actually, it's a comma that is not in a statute in Maine state law.

SMITH: The $10,000,000 comma.

KING: The $10,000,000 comma.

SMITH: Explain.

KING: An Oxford comma. OK. So you know what an Oxford comma is, right?

SMITH: Yes. I'm a firm believer in the Oxford comma. If you have a list of items - like, you say, I like desert, soup and oranges, you put a comma after the soup and before the and. It's that comma in a list of items.

KING: The last comment in a list of items. But there's a fierce debate over this. Some people think the Oxford comma is totally unnecessary, which brings us back to this case in Maine. I'm going to give you a little primer on what Maine law says. Maine law says everybody gets overtime except for certain people. There are groups that just don't get paid OT. Those people include people who work, who handle or ship perishable foods. They don't, for some reason, make overtime. But the statute spells it out really clearly. It says the following. It says, any worker who is involved in, quote, "canning, processing"...

SMITH: Got it.

KING: ...Preserving"...

SMITH: Yep.

KING: ..."Freezing, drying"...

SMITH: Makes sense.

KING: ..."Marketing...

SMITH: Yes.

KING: ..."Storing"...

SMITH: Absolutely.

KING: ..."Packing for shipment or distribution of perishable foods." And there are commas between all of the words...

SMITH: OK, yes.

KING: ...On that list except packing for shipment or distribution. So there's no Oxford comma, no last comma between shipment and distribution.

SMITH: So that raises the question - does it refer to packing for shipment or distribution or packing for shipment or distribution?

KING: That was radio magic, what you just did. Yes.

SMITH: Did I do the - that was a radio comma, yes.

KING: This is such an easy thing to see in print, but it is a very hard thing to say. But yes, that's exactly it. And what the workers' lawyer said it's because there's no Oxford comma it is packing for shipment or distribution, meaning distribution itself - driving the milk to stores and uncrating it - that is not an exempt profession. You get overtime.

SMITH: And so did this court case go before an eighth grade teacher who decided the whole thing?

KING: Actually, everyone kept referencing their 10th grade teachers, which I just think is so weird.

SMITH: Because that's when that happens, yeah.

KING: This case went before three different judges five different times. And here is where it has landed - a judge in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals said because there is no Oxford comma the wording is too ambiguous for him to come down on the side of the company. The judge is essentially saying if the state wanted to make it clear that distribution is one of the things for which you don't make overtime, they probably should have put an Oxford comma in that list.

SMITH: So for want of a comma, the court case was won.

KING: The court case actually has not been won just yet. What the judge said is that it can proceed.

SMITH: Thank you, Noel.

KING: Thanks, Robert.

SMITH: We are now going to ratchet this up five - five - decimal places, up to a trillion dollars, after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY AND SKINNY WILLIAMS' "SEARCHING FOR CLUES")

SMITH: Our final number today is $1 trillion. I kind of want to do a Dr. Evil. One trillion dollars.

AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: (Laughter) Kaboom.

SMITH: That laughter comes from Ailsa Chang, who until very recently was NPR's Senate correspondent, now a new member of PLANET MONEY. Welcome.

CHANG: Yay, thank you.

SMITH: And $1 trillion is in the news right now because...

CHANG: Because President Trump has said that he wants to spend a trillion dollars to build infrastructure all across the United States.

SMITH: Now, he probably picked this number because it sounds amazing, a trillion dollars, but we had the question - is that a lot of money when it comes to infrastructure? It seems like a lot of money. But there's a lot of different ways to look at this.

CHANG: And it is a lot of money if you think about what we're already spending on infrastructure. We're spending 2.5 trillion over the next 10 years. So a trillion on top of that more is a 40 percent jump.

SMITH: Which would put it up there with the sort of historic levels of spending on infrastructure the country has seen.

CHANG: It would be a moment in history. President Eisenhower spent roughly that scale of money when he started the interstate highway system. And, you know, if you wanted to rebuild the entire interstate highway system today, it would actually take half a trillion, just half of Trump's infrastructure budget.

SMITH: But Donald Trump did not say he wanted to spend a trillion dollars on roads. He said he wanted to...

CHANG: Do everything everywhere.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, highways, airports, schools, hospitals. We will...

SMITH: You get a sewer system. You get a highway. You know - what? - you want new elevators in your municipal building? You got it.

CHANG: (Laughter) Exactly. So you start to think, well, if Trump wants to do everything everywhere, how far does a trillion dollars actually go? What does it actually buy you in real terms? And that's what I set to find out just boppin' around New York City.

SMITH: Yeah, obviously the most expensive place...

CHANG: Absolutely.

SMITH: ...To built in the country.

CHANG: Absolutely.

SMITH: But the money doesn't go very far if you walk around.

CHANG: All right, I'm riding the Second Avenue Subway right now.

OK, so this is the new subway line on the East Side of Manhattan. It cost $4.5 billion dollars just to add three subway stops to that line.

I just rode the subway one stop, which means I just burned through a billion and a half dollars. That took about 73 seconds.

Or go down to the newly built transportation hub down by the World Trade Center. It's called the Oculus.

SMITH: It is a gorgeous, gorgeous place.

CHANG: I'm standing in basically a giant hallway right now. It's like the lobby for a train station. And this whole place cost $4 billion.

SMITH: And it is basically just the entrance to a train station, we should say.

CHANG: That's right. And if you look at a list of planned projects for New York City, you see, like, how quickly this money can be depleted. Another 10 billion would be needed to rebuild the Port Authority bus terminal. Another 20 billion would be needed to build a Amtrak tunnel under the Hudson River. If you want more community centers, you want to rebuild housing, hospitals, water mains and sewers, all that money quickly adds up. You can get to 100 billion in a blink of an eye.

SMITH: And that's just one city in the entire country.

CHANG: Yeah. The biggest city, but just one city. And I should say this. When Donald Trump says $1 trillion for infrastructure, you need to keep in mind two caveats. First of all, we're talking about a trillion dollars over 10 years. So that's 100 billion per year for the entire country. And secondly, most of this money, the idea is, is going to come from private investors.

SMITH: Yeah, this was the fine print on the infrastructure plan, which was that the government was going to offer tax breaks for private industry to build a lot of these things.

CHANG: And the concern about that is that maybe private investors would be incentivized to invest in projects that would provide big revenue streams.

SMITH: Big, shiny things they can brag about, or things like toll roads they can make money off of.

CHANG: Exactly, instead of, say, building sewer systems.

SMITH: Yeah, no one wants to do a ribbon cutting in a sewer system.

CHANG: (Laughter).

SMITH: Thanks, Ailsa.

CHANG: You're welcome.

CHANG: Do you have a number you want us to explain? Write us at planetmoneynpr.org. Or check us out on Twitter or Facebook.

SMITH: Today's episode was produced by Nick Fountain and Sally Helm. And now that you're done listening to PLANET MONEY, may we suggest another fine podcast? I don't know if you've been listening, but Embedded is back for a special three-episode podcast miniseries about police shootings. You should check it out, Embedded on the NPR One app or wherever you get your fine podcasts. I'm Robert Smith.

CHANG: And I'm Ailsa Chang. Thanks for listening.

Don't use numbers. Don't use very many numbers because the idea is you're listening to this and actually probably doing something

It's a sort of like rhythm poetry thing like I could listen to numbers and I do
For hours. In fact, sometimes in the morning, I will listen to Bloomberg Business Radio drives my family nuts

Let's check in and how the markets are trading the Dow is down by 65 points
It has to be lower by 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq is trading down by one tenth of 1% in the bond markets
You're seeing some buying going on in treasuries that yield coming down about 3 basis points 2.7 2

Three numbers in particular three price tags. Give me the big sound
One trillion dollars
ten million dollars and
$4.66
The trillion dollars represents the dream for America ten million dollars is the price of a single punctuation mark and four dollars and sixty six cents
That number involves a magical fairy visits in the middle of the night. Oh

On the show we're going to talk about what different things cost starting with the very small and cheap to the
Inconceivably expensive. So let's just start with a handful of change
This right here around a dollar and change was what I used to get when I was a child for a tooth
Placed underneath my pillow at night from the tooth fairy now
I didn't think much about how much I got just I wanted a lot of coins
But now that I'm a father like this has actually been a discussion
I had late into the night how much should a child get for a single tooth?
From the tooth fairy and the more you think about it the more you realize this is an
Overlooked economic indicator. So we brought in reporter Kenny Malone to tell us one tooth one child
How much is it worth? I have an answer
$4.66
It's very specific boom
$4.66 and we know this how we know this because there is strikingly good data
On what people are giving their kids for teeth the done by the tooth industry or the dentist
Tooth well, let's call it big tooth every year for just about the last 20 years
Delta dental the insurance company has been conducting the tooth fairy poll and nationally representative survey and
Currently a tooth is pulling in four dollars and sixty six cents
So four dollars sixty six cents on average, which is more than I got as a kid
Yeah, me too
And Robert the more I looked into this the more I realized that there is something very strange going on with the tooth fairy
Right now this sounds a little silly, but I can give you an example of just how serious this can get
Let me look let me set a scene for you. It's the Obama White House

I'm guessing first child first kid first tooth and I think she had lost it that morning. It was a crisis
So she turns the room and she says does anyone know what the tooth fairy is paying these days and the room lights
Up even people without kids start jumping in with their ideas. Betsy Stevenson her approach is well
What did the tooth fairy give me as a kid 50 cents? I'm guessing mid 70s or so
Yeah mid 70s and 50 cents doesn't buy what it used to so the question is can we adjust that for inflation?
This is a room full of our nation's top economists. They can do it. Betsy just figures it out
What is 50 cents from the 70s worth now an inflation adjusted number might put you something closer to three dollars a tooth
Three dollars a tooth. That's the inflated number, but she asks the other economists
What are your kids actually getting and they say five to twenty dollars? Whoa
Some kid got $20 for a tooth. There's general consensus that probably the tooth fairy didn't have any change on that particular night
That does happen. But in in all seriousness though, I mean as serious as this particular story can get I'm looking here at that
study that you gave me about the average tooth fairy gift and
It is going up faster than inflation faster than you might think it would yeah and this Robert
This is the mystery over the last ten years according to that Delta dental study
We were looking at the price of a tooth has skyrocketed dental inflation
Let's let's call it has averaged over ten percent per year
Which it never does anywhere in the economy inflation
That's an insane number and so I figured we needed an expert to get to the bottom of this
Yep, this is Alan Blinder professor of economics at Princeton University. He must have loved getting this call
So Alan Blinder is not just some economist in the 1990s
He was vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board and as you know, Robert one of the most important jobs of the Fed is to
monitor
Inflation and keep it low and keep it low and explain to him that teeth have been going up at this crazy rate
Around ten percent per year teeth you say yeah
I can't think of anything that's gone up at ten percent and for comparison
He said actual inflation over the last decade must be right around two percent two percent
So I mean, I guess the obvious question is what is so special about a tooth that makes it go up
So rapidly that was the question that I had and I thought maybe we could find an answer in the way
We calculate inflation that two percent number. That's the inflation for everything everything from fuel to bananas to a house
That's not stuff kids buy they only care about a tiny little section of that
So one theory I had was what if we ask kids what do you actually care about and maybe that stuff?
Maybe that stuff has gotten more expensive at a really high rate
broad strokes of what these kids around New York said toys
electronics and candy
Alan Blinder said actually a lot of that stuff has gotten cheaper over the last decade sure because toys are
Manufactured overseas in China electronics are way more powerful. You can put chips into anything and stuff just gets cheaper
Yeah, and so by economic logic, maybe the tooth fairy should actually be bringing less than a decade ago
Yeah, I think the kids are making out like bandits here. Do you think an intervention is necessary from your no
I wouldn't I wouldn't advocate government's intervention. So the mystery deepens
It's not like kids are getting more money for more stuff
Then what explains that $20 bill?
Yeah, this is the question that I took to do my final economist Justin Wolfers
Who's a professor at the University of Michigan if you want to work some economic jargon into this?
Economists talk about something called the income elasticity of demand. We do want to work some economic
We definitely want to talk about the income elasticity of demand go
So let's say that you get a raise 10% if all of a sudden you started making 10% more
That doesn't mean that you're gonna suddenly spend 10% more on every single part of your life
You're not gonna spend 10% more necessarily on food for example
but there are these categories of things that we might spend more than 10% more on now that we have the money and
Wolfers suspects that children are one of those things we like to splurge on and so it doesn't surprise me to hear that the tooth

One more thing about Justin Wolfers, so remember at the beginning of this
We talked about the White House the tooth fairy summit Betsey Stevenson the economist
Justin Wolfers is her partner that kid who lost her tooth. That's Justin's daughter. So together they figured it out
We're a family that we take in data and the median seems to be a great place to be and that's exactly where
Our family was the tooth fairy brought five dollars
five dollars I
Feel like my kids have never gotten five dollars, but Robert that is the going rate man
I just can't do it. Does that make you a bad father? I'm sorry. I can't help it
I think of it as as pocket full of change
I think it has changed too
But this particular argument always ends up with being back in my day
I walked up hill three ways to get my tooth fairy money
I just feel like you can't talk about this without just sounding like a super old person
All right, five dollars. It is five dollars Kenny Malone one of the newest correspondents for Planet Money. Thank you, sir
Thank you. Do we thank is that a thing we do? You're welcome. You're welcome
All right, let's take a huge leap from pocket change to our next number 10 million 10 million dollars 10 million dollars
That is the voice of no Al King who has the story of a very unusual court case
Yes
It is a group of dairy truck drivers up in Maine who are suing their bosses for unpaid overtime
These guys were working long days 12 16 hours. Their bosses were only paying them for eight
So they say you owe us a bunch of money so far very normal case
Yes, this court case hinges on a comma that is in a statute or actually it's a comma that is not in a statute in
Maine state law the 10 million dollar comma the 10 million dollar comma an Oxford comma
Okay, so you know what an Oxford comma is, right? Yes
I am a firm believer in the Oxford comma if you have a list of items like you say I like dessert
soup and
Oranges you put a comma after the soup and before the end
It's that comma in a list of items the last comma in a list of items
But there's a fierce debate over this some people think the Oxford comma is totally unnecessary
Which brings us back to this case in Maine?
I'm gonna give you a little primer on what Maine law says the Maine law says everybody gets overtime except for certain people
There are there are groups that just don't get paid OT
Those people include people who work who handle or ship perishable foods
They don't for some reason make overtime, but the statute spells it out really clearly. It says the following
It says any worker who is involved in quote
canning
Processing preserving. Yep, freezing drying marketing. Yes during packing for shipment or distribution of
Perishable foods and there are commas between all of the words on that list except
packing for shipment or
Distribution so there's no Oxford comma no last comma between shipment and distribution
So that raises the question. Does it refer to packing for?
shipment or distribution or packing for shipment or
distribution
This is such an easy thing to see in print but it is a very hard thing to say but yes
That's exactly it and what the workers lawyer said is because there's no Oxford comma
It is packing for shipment or distribution meaning
Distribution itself driving the milk to stores and uncrating it that is not an exempt profession
You get overtime and so did this court case go before an eighth grade teacher who decided the whole thing?
Actually, everyone kept referencing their tenth grade teachers. This thing is so
This case went before three different judges five different times
And here is where it has landed a judge in the first Circuit Court of Appeals said because there is no Oxford comma
The wording is too ambiguous for him to come down on the side of the company
The judge is essentially saying if the state wanted to make it clear that
Distribution is one of the things for which you don't make overtime
They probably should have put an Oxford comma in that list
So for want of a comma the court case was one the court case actually has not been one just yet
What the judge said is that it can proceed. Thank you, Noel. Thanks Robert
We are now going to ratchet this up five five decimal places up to a trillion dollars after the break
support for planet money and the following message come from iShares because the best
Preparation for tomorrow is building for your future today iShares by BlackRock inspired to build
Our final number today is one
trillion dollars, I kind of want to do a dr. Eva one
trillion
Dollars that
Laughter comes from Elsa Chang who until very recently was NPR's Senate correspondent now a new member of planet money
welcome, yeah, thank you and one trillion dollars is in the news right now because because
President Trump has said that he wants to spend a trillion dollars to build infrastructure all across the United States now
You probably picked this number because it sounds amazing a trillion dollars, but we had the question
Is that a lot of money when it comes to infrastructure?
It seems like a lot of money, but there's a lot of different ways to look at this
And it is a lot of money if you think about what we're already spending on infrastructure
We're spending two and a half trillion over the next ten years
so a trillion on top of that more is a 40% jump which would put it up there with the sort of
Historic levels of spending on infrastructure the country's seen it would be a moment in history
President Eisenhower spent roughly that scale of money when he started the interstate highway system
And you know if you wanted to rebuild the entire interstate highway system today
It would actually take half a trillion just half of Trump's infrastructure budget
But Donald Trump did not say he wanted to spend a trillion dollars on roads. He said he wanted to
Do everything everywhere we will rebuild our roads our bridges our tunnels highways airports schools
Hospitals we you get a sewer system you get a highway
You know what you want new elevators in your municipal building you got it
Exactly, so you start to think well if Trump wants to do everything everywhere
How far does a trillion dollars actually go?
What does it actually buy you in real terms, and that's what I set to find out just bopping around New York City
Yeah, obviously the most expensive place absolutely build in the country absolutely, but the money doesn't go very far if you walk around
All right, I'm riding a second Avenue subway right now
Okay, so this is the new subway line on the east side of Manhattan it costs four and a half billion dollars just to add
three subway stops to that line I
Just rode the subway one stop which means I just burned through a billion and a half dollars that took about
73 seconds or go down to the newly built transportation hub down by the World Trade Center
It's called the oculus. It is a gorgeous gorgeous place. I'm standing in basically a giant
Hallway right now. It's like the lobby for a train station and this whole place cost four billion dollars
And it's basically just the entrance to a train station
That's right
And if you look at a list of planned projects for New York City you see like how quickly this money can be depleted
Another 10 billion would be needed to rebuild the Port Authority bus terminal another 20 billion would be needed to
Build a Amtrak tunnel under the Hudson River if you want more community centers
You want to rebuild housing hospitals water mains and sewers all that money quickly adds up
You can get to a hundred billion in a blink of an eye and that's just one city in the entire country
Yeah, the biggest city but just one city and I should say this when Donald Trump says one trillion dollars for infrastructure
You need to keep in mind two caveats. First of all, we're talking about a trillion dollars over ten years
So that's a hundred billion per year for the entire country
And secondly most of his money the ideas is going to come from private investors
Yeah
This was the fine print on the infrastructure plan which was that the government was going to offer tax breaks
For private industry to build a lot of these things and the concern about that
Is that maybe private investors would be incentivized to invest in projects that would provide big revenue streams
Big shiny things they can brag about or things like toll roads. They can make money off of exactly instead of say
Building sewer systems. Yeah. No one wants to do a ribbon-cutting in a sewer system
