For most of our lives, Equifax has been slurping up our financial data. Now the company's been hacked and our data is loose. Today, we trace this mess back to two brothers and one fateful decision.

In 1874, if you wanted to buy groceries on store credit, the cashier would reach under the counter and pull out a little blue book. Inside would be your name, profession and whether you paid your debts on time. It was the beginning of the Equifax business model. And it was never about the regular citizens. It was about the businesses that wanted to lend to them. Regular people are the product. Banks and businesses are the customers.

#798: Bad Credit Bureau

And in many ways, that makes sense. Businesses do work better if they know something about their patrons. It's safer to lend money, which means it's cheaper and easier to get for "creditworthy" customers. Sort of a win-win but for one uncomfortable thing: Today, credit bureaus like Equifax have grown into massive corporations that slurp up virtually every piece of our financial lives. We never signed up for Equifax, or either of the other two companies that monitor just about every non-cash transaction. We never opted in. And it's hard to opt out.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

It was a big week for apologies, and they all happened to come from one person - Richard Smith.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

RICHARD SMITH: I'm truly and deeply sorry for what happened. I deeply apologize.

Mistakes were made which, again, I deeply apologize.

I apologize for that, but that is what happened.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: OK, moving on.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

Richard Smith was testifying before Congress because he is the now former CEO of Equifax, which informed us last month that basically all of us have been hacked.

ROBERT SMITH: The company announced that the information for almost 150 million Americans has been compromised. And I know you've heard this sort of thing before with other hacks. But this hack is different because for starters, you did not sign up for Equifax, which is one of the three major credit bureaus. And for basically your entire life, they have been slurping up and storing your most personal information.

MALONE: Which means that Equifax and maybe now the hackers know my Social Security number and my address, and the fact that I opened a Gap credit card, and the fact that I missed a payment last month, and the fact that I only paid $300 towards my Subaru Impreza instead of the 400 that I normally pay.

ROBERT SMITH: Times are tight.

MALONE: They know everything.

ROBERT SMITH: One hundred and fifty million Americans looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives, worried about someone filing our tax forms and taking our refunds.

MALONE: My personal nightmare is somebody walking into Home Depot, opening up a credit card with my name on it, grabbing a giant orange shopping cart and filling it with drills and circular saws and shop vacs.

ROBERT SMITH: And getting 10 percent off the whole thing. That's what really bugs me.

MALONE: It's my 10 percent.

ROBERT SMITH: My discount.

MALONE: At any rate, it's bad, which was pointed out to Richard Smith by a lot of our elected representatives.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

GREG WALDEN: Talk about ham-handed responses. This is simply unacceptable.

ELIZABETH WARREN: Senior executives like you should be held personally accountable here.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: So here in my last 13 seconds I'm going to speak to America. And I'm going to say for the 145 million people, file a lawsuit. Otherwise they're going to keep doing to you what they've been doing to you forever.

ROBERT SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith.

MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. And this Equifax hack, it feels like a dystopian sci-fi future. We've got shadowy hackers roaming through our data in this central location that we didn't even sign up for. And it feels like such a modern-day problem.

ROBERT SMITH: And yet this whole mess goes back to one moment, a moment when two brothers in Brooklyn decided they were going to sell our private information to the world, and that we were not going to be the customers. We were going to be the product.

MALONE: This happened 150 years ago. And people were asking themselves the same questions we are asking ourselves now - who owns your information? Who has a right to see that information? And is there any limit on what someone is allowed to dig up on you?

ROBERT SMITH: It is quite the story. We'll have it after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Hey, Nora.

NORA LYONS: Hi.

MALONE: This is Robert.

LYONS: Nice to meet you.

ROBERT SMITH: Thanks.

MALONE: Show us the way to the secret documents.

ROBERT SMITH: We heard that one of the very first credit reports ever, precursor of this whole Equifax thing, was in the archives here at The New York Public Library. Nora Lyons helped us pull it out of storage showed us to the famous Rose Reading Room, beautiful room at the top of the library. And a research coordinator named Rebecca (ph) walks in and gently holds this little blue booklet out to us.

MALONE: I brought a pair of gloves. I didn't know if we would need them to touch - no.

LYONS: No, you don't wear them with this.

ROBERT SMITH: It's not the Gutenberg Bible.

MALONE: I thought it was.

REBECCA: Well, you wouldn't - you wouldn't wear gloves with the Gutenberg either.

LYONS: Because if it snags...

MALONE: Wait, really?

REBECCA: It's going to rip the paper.

MALONE: The front of this book says "Retail Mercantile Agency 1874."

ROBERT SMITH: It looks like a phonebook.

MALONE: There's a list of about 4,000 people who live in Brooklyn.

ROBERT SMITH: Back in the day.

MALONE: And then next to each name is an address and then some old-timey job - butchers, druggists.

ROBERT SMITH: So many grocers. And there was a sailor of some sort.

MALONE: What's his name? Oh, it's just Captain Collins (ph).

ROBERT SMITH: Captain Collins always pays his debts. He gets an A.

MALONE: Does it say that?

ROBERT SMITH: He does get an A.

MALONE: And sure enough next to each name is a letter, a letter grade that tells us just how trustworthy Captain Collins was. So we flip to the front of the book.

ROBERT SMITH: Oh, look; right here.

MALONE: So this is the key.

ROBERT SMITH: An A means that the captain pays his debts right away. If there had been a B there, it would mean that he always paid in cash. Letter C would mean perhaps he didn't always pay his debts on time.

MALONE: And then there's one final code, and it's an ampersand or, like, the...

ROBERT SMITH: And.

MALONE: Like an and. And it basically means we're not going to put this person's rating in this book. Come talk to us. There's some stuff you should probably know about this person.

ROBERT SMITH: We had some questions about how the book worked in real life in Brooklyn back in the day, so we went to an expert, Josh Lauer. He wrote a book.

JOSH LAUER: My book is called "Creditworthy: A History Of Consumer Surveillance And Financial Identity In America."

MALONE: You went - you went for broke on that subtitle.

LAUER: I did.

ROBERT SMITH: Josh explained to us that credit in the early 1800s, it was not what we think of today. It wasn't credit cards or auto loans because, like, obviously those did not exist back then.

MALONE: What credit meant was a tab at your town store. So let's say that Robert Smith, you are a farmer and it's 1825. What crops are you...

ROBERT SMITH: Farm apples.

MALONE: Apples, OK. So Robert goes into the grocery store to pick up whatever he needs, maybe like some butter, some cigars. And Robert tells the grocer...

ROBERT SMITH: Yeah, I don't have any money. The apple crop hasn't come in yet. And so I'm going to need you to extend me some credit.

MALONE: And I, as the grocer, I look at Robert and I say, oh, Mr. Smith. Well, I know your uncle and I've known your father, and darn it if I don't trust the Smiths more than I trust myself.

LAUER: And he says, take your butter, take your cigars. I know you'll come back next week and you'll settle. And...

ROBERT SMITH: And good day, sir.

LAUER: And good day.

MALONE: And that system worked for a long time. But after the Civil War, people started moving around, heading to cities, especially Brooklyn, N.Y.

ROBERT SMITH: Give me a little sound effects from Brooklyn.

LAUER: How about this? Extra, extra, read all about it - population of Brooklyn booming.

MALONE: Love it.

ROBERT SMITH: Love it.

This created a problem. More strangers were showing up at the grocery store looking to buy things on credit, and the grocer needed to answer a pretty simple question - will this person pay me back? I know nothing about him.

MALONE: Enter the Cells (ph) brothers.

LAUER: Herman (ph) and Conrad (ph) Cells. And there isn't a lot of evidence that survives about them and about who they are.

ROBERT SMITH: So for the purposes of this story, we can imagine them however we like. You know, handlebar mustaches, blue velvet vests.

MALONE: Maybe some monocles, maybe pocket watches.

ROBERT SMITH: A jaunty cane.

MALONE: Cane - yes, yes. The Cellses were Mr. Peanutses.

ROBERT SMITH: They were two Mr. Peanuts.

MALONE: The Cells brothers were in Brooklyn in 1869. And they start going around to the butchers and the druggists and the tailors.

LAUER: And saying, we're organizing a list of all customers in our neighborhood.

MALONE: So it would be great, dear cobbler, if you would let me look at your books and find out who's in there, who pays cash, who uses credit, who pays back that credit. And that way if a stranger named Robert Smith walks into my store, I would just pull out the Cells book.

ROBERT SMITH: Oh, yeah, look right here - Robert Smith, plumber, 1102 Lafayette Avenue, B-A. Always pay in cash, always pay on time.

MALONE: Robert Smith.

ROBERT SMITH: Smith motto.

MALONE: Is that true?

ROBERT SMITH: That's - no. No.

The one thing that struck us when we looked at this little pamphlet is you could almost feel the Cells trying to be as careful as humanly possible to give the minimum amount of information. They're not judging people. They're not slandering them. They just put down the name, the job and a simple little rating.

MALONE: It was almost as if the Cells knew that if they were going to create an industry where people's information was the product that maybe, like, just maybe you should be careful with that information.

ROBERT SMITH: So we should note it says confidential on here.

MALONE: Yeah. Which means sitting here, reading these names and these ratings, this is the equivalent of an 1874 Equifax hack.

ROBERT SMITH: (Laughter) We're hacking 18-something-something Brooklyn.

MALONE: And leaking everybody's credit rating.

ROBERT SMITH: (Laughter).

MALONE: The Cells' idea was a huge success. It was obviously good for retailers who could lend more credit and sell more stuff.

ROBERT SMITH: And it was also good for people who wanted to buy things, people like my doppelganger from the 1800s, Bob Smith the plumber. He could get credit almost anywhere because it said in a little book that he always paid his debts. And frankly, he could probably get a discount on the things he bought because he was not a risk.

MALONE: These credit reports were such a big success that over the next century, thousands of credit bureaus were established all over the country. And like any competitive marketplace, these bureaus tried to have the best product, which in this case means that there was market pressure for more and more information.

ROBERT SMITH: Yeah, the Cells brothers just gave you a letter grade. But imagine some other credit agency says, well, you know, we have a bunch of personal information about Robert Smith the plumber. Don't you want to buy our book instead?

MALONE: And so a lot of information ended up in people's credit files.

ROBERT SMITH: Marital status.

LAUER: Marital status. Married men were...

MALONE: Married men were considered less risky, needed to remain upstanding and pay their debts.

ROBERT SMITH: Do I want to know medical conditions?

LAUER: If you could know something about that...

MALONE: If you have a broken foot and can't work, that'd be good to know, might not pay back your debts.

What about vices - drinking, gambling, philandering?

LAUER: Absolutely. So...

MALONE: Over time, credit bureaus realized that these dossiers, they weren't just useful for lenders. Insurance companies and employers might also like to see them. And so they kept growing and building their consumer reports.

ROBERT SMITH: Consumers sort of knew the information was being collected. But the full extent of this collection came out in 1966 because of an almost offhand comment in Washington, D.C.

MALONE: What had had happened was the Congress was holding a totally unrelated set of hearings. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau were proposing a computerized centralized database.

ROBERT SMITH: And the representatives were losing their minds. I mean, this was Big Brother. This could not stand. So they held hearings. And during one of those hearings a computer expert was testifying. And he was like, you guys are worried about collection and centralization of data? You do know that's already happening - right? - with the credit bureaus?

MALONE: And Congress was like, what? We need new hearings right now.

ROBERT SMITH: More hearings.

MALONE: Let's do it. It actually took two years. But let's do it.

ROBERT SMITH: And the news coverage of the time, it could have come from this week.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: In Washington, another day of hearing on the behavior of the credit bureaus who keep records on almost everyone.

MALONE: And it is eerie to listen to these old hearings. Nothing has changed. They trot out a figurehead from one of these credit bureaus.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ATTORNEY: And we received him courteously. And we discussed...

ROBERT SMITH: This Jimmy Stewart-talking gentleman was an attorney for the Retail Credit Company. The Retail Credit Company was one of the largest bureaus at the time.

MALONE: And this next piece of tape has no relevance, but just listen to how he talks.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ATTORNEY: And I don't blame them a bit, see?

ROBERT SMITH: See?

MALONE: See?

ROBERT SMITH: See, at this hearing, what came out was this pretty damning copy of someone's credit report.

MALONE: We have a copy of this because it was filed during the hearings. It's for a woman named Mary Wilson. And she was having trouble finding a job, she learned, because of what the Retail Credit Company put in this report. It says here that Mary is, quote, "dominating."

ROBERT SMITH: Peculiar.

MALONE: And worst of all, quote, "neurotic or psychotic."

ROBERT SMITH: And it does not say who said this about her. Maybe it was her neighbor or someone she worked with. For sure we know it was not a doctor diagnosing her as psychotic. It was essentially a piece of hearsay.

MALONE: The 1960s senators were outraged at the Retail Credit Company. But instead of apologizing...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ATTORNEY: What's wrong with hearsay?

MALONE: The Retail Credit Company's lawyer dug in his heels.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ATTORNEY: Hearsay is bandied around in these hearings as though it was a dirty word, and it isn't.

ROBERT SMITH: I don't know, Congress seemed to think it was a dirty word because these hearings spawned the first major piece of legislation to finally regulate credit bureaus. It's called the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970.

MALONE: That law and some of the amendments that would come later, they would effectively stop credit bureaus from collecting hearsay and rumors. They would allow consumers to see their own credit files. They would attempt to fix errors and to limit some of the reasons that people could pull your consumer report.

ROBERT SMITH: The credit reporting industry changed pretty quickly after this. Computers meant that data could be centralized and spread more easily, which meant you didn't need small regional bureaus in every town to collect gossip on people. The industry consolidated, it consolidated, it consolidated until eventually there were only three big credit reporting bureaus.

MALONE: And Josh Lauer, our credit historian, says the Retail Credit Company took such a beating during these hearings and in the years to come that it decided to change its name to something more equal-sounding, more fact-based.

ROBERT SMITH: Equal and fact-based.

MALONE: They changed their name to Equifax.

(SOUNDBITE OF FREDERIC KOOSHMANIAN AND TREMOLO TOM'S "ACROBATIC")

ROBERT SMITH: When we come back from the break a new name, a new round of congressional hearings, and some new ideas on how to fix the industry, see?

(SOUNDBITE OF FREDERIC KOOSHMANIAN AND TREMOLO TOM'S "ACROBATIC")

ROBERT SMITH: So to bring us up to the present, we know that Equifax got hacked. And we know it was much worse than what we did in the library to the Cells brothers' little blue book.

MALONE: And we should say here that we reached out to Equifax and one of the major trade associations that represents them. They both declined to be interviewed. But we still had questions about what we are supposed to do now.

Hey, Chi Chi, can you hear us?

CHI CHI WU: Yeah, I can hear you guys fine.

MALONE: All right, good.

Chi Chi Wu is a consumer advocate. She's a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.

WU: We've been telling everyone who will listen to us, freeze your credit report at all three credit bureaus - Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.

MALONE: Those are the big three credit bureaus. And a freeze basically means that no one is allowed to pull my credit report, not unless I temporarily lift the freeze for them. That way if somebody tries to open a Gap card with my stolen information, Gap would go and try to check my credit, but they wouldn't be allowed because there's a freeze and the Gap application would be denied.

ROBERT SMITH: Now, here's the catch. And it depends on where you live. But this is something that credit bureaus typically charge you to do, to protect your own information.

WU: And then the other thing is you're going to have to pay to temporarily lift or thaw the freeze when you do want credit.

MALONE: Come on.

ROBERT SMITH: (Unintelligible).

WU: And so you have to pay again. Yeah.

MALONE: Equifax, though, is already bowing to pressure on that. And they're saying that they're going to remove their fees, which seems like the very least that they could do.

ROBERT SMITH: But Chi Chi says this is the moment where everyone who has had a beef over the last few decades with the credit reporting industry is trying to change whatever it is they think is wrong with the system.

MALONE: And there is a lot of beefs. For example, people would like to see a higher accuracy standard for the credit bureaus. They'd like to make it easier for people to change errors in their reports. And there's also a call to limit who is allowed to use your credit report to judge you. Chi Chi says this is true especially for employers.

WU: With this sense that the credit report is some sort of proxy for how responsible someone is.

MALONE: I think Robert Smith thinks that. I think if I had a bad credit score, Robert would think less of me. I'm just looking across the table from him right now, and he's...

ROBERT SMITH: Kind of. I kind of would. Just pay the bills on time.

WU: But you shouldn't because it could have been because something bad happened to Kenny, right? He...

MALONE: Yeah, Robert.

WU: There's a lot of folks who miss payments or default because they lose their job, they get sick, they get divorced, you know, there's a death in the family. A lot of times bad credit is the result of bad luck.

ROBERT SMITH: This seems to be sort of dancing around the core issue. Why not just pass a law that says they can't have my credit information unless I say yes?

WU: Well, that would certainly give consumers a measure of control. Now, how effective that would be I'm not sure because in order for you to get credit, you'd probably end up having to agree to this.

ROBERT SMITH: You can never leave. They keep pulling you back in.

WU: We're captives. We're the product. We're the asset.

MALONE: In other words, we are not and have never been the customers.

ROBERT SMITH: Carrying this story makes me think that, like, the Cells brothers in the 1800s really did decide the direction of the entire industry because, you know, they could have provided letters of credit to people like Robert Smith the plumber back in the 1800s. They could have provided a little laminated - if you could laminate things - they could have provided a little framed letter that said, this person is worthy of credit. And that way the customer would keep control of their own information. But they decided not to do it that way. They decided that the money was in the businesses. The businesses were willing to pay. So ever since then, you and me and regular consumers have had no say.

MALONE: So let's all go freeze our credit.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Welcome to the Equifax automated security freeze system. This automated system will allow you to place or permanently remove a security freeze from your Equifax credit file.

ROBERT SMITH: Who did they hire to do that?

MALONE: Yeah, who - that is someone from inside Equifax that are like, we need you to sound like the movie guy.

ROBERT SMITH: Yeah, the toughest voice you have 'cause we got to look tough in these troubling times.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROBERT SMITH: Let us know what you thought of the program. Our email address is planetmoney@npr.org. Or you can find us on Twitter and Facebook and even Instagram. Instagram.

MALONE: Today's show was produced by Nick Fountain. PLANET MONEY's supervising producer is Alex Goldmark. Bryant Urstadt edits the show. Thanks this week to Chris Hoofnagle and James Rule, who spent a lot of time explaining the Fair Credit Reporting Act to me. And special thanks to The New York Public Library for letting us in and letting us be loud.

How much time do we have to still yell in the great reading room?

LYONS: You have I'm going to say 12 minutes.

MALONE: Great.

ROBERT SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone.

ROBERT SMITH: And I am Robert Smith.

Thanks for listening.

MALONE: It is a shrine, a palace, a Vatican, Sistine Chapel to books.

Robert Smith, plumber.
1102 Lafayette Avenue, B.A.
Always paying cash, always paying time.
Robert Smith. Smith motto.
Is that true? That's no. No.
The one thing that struck us when we looked at this little pamphlet is
you can almost feel the Sells trying to be as careful as humanly possible.
To give the minimum amount of information.
They're not judging people. They're not slandering them.
They just put down the name, the job and a simple little rating.
It was almost as if the Sells knew that if they were going to create
an industry where people's information was the product,
that maybe, like just maybe, you should be careful with that information.
So we should note it says confidential on here.
Yeah, which means sitting here reading these names and these ratings.
This is the equivalent of an 1874 Equifax hack.
We're hacking 18 something something Brooklyn and leaking everybody's credit rating.
The Sells idea was a huge success.
It was obviously good for retailers who could lend more credit and sell more stuff.
And it was also good for people who wanted to buy things.
People like my doppelganger from the 1800s, Bob Smith, the plumber.
He could get credit almost anywhere because it said in a little book
that he always paid his debts.
And frankly, he could probably get a discount on the things he bought
because he was not a risk.
These credit reports were such a big success that over the next century,
thousands of credit bureaus were established all over the country.
And like any competitive marketplace, these bureaus tried to have the best product,
which in this case means that there was market pressure for more and more information.
Yeah, the Sells brothers just gave you a letter grade.
But imagine some other credit agency says, well, you know,
we have a bunch of personal information about Robert Smith, the plumber.
Don't you want to buy our book instead?
And so a lot of information ended up in people's credit files.
Marital status, marital status, married men, married men were considered less risky,
needed to remain upstanding and pay their debts.
Do I want to know medical conditions?
If you could know something about that, if you have a broken foot and can't work,
that'd be good to know.
Might not pay back your debts.
What about vices, drinking, gambling, philandering?
Absolutely. So over time, credit bureaus realized that these dossiers,
they weren't just useful for lenders, insurance companies and employers
might also like to see them.
And so they kept growing and building their consumer reports.
Consumers sort of knew the information was being collected,
but the full extent of this collection came out in 1966
because of an almost offhand comment in Washington, D.C.
What had happened was the Congress was holding a totally unrelated
set of hearings. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S.
Census Bureau were proposing a computerized centralized database.
And the representatives were losing their minds.
I mean, this was Big Brother. This could not stand.
So they held hearings.
And during one of those hearings, a computer expert was testifying.
And he was like, you guys are worried about collection and centralization
of data. You do know that's already happening, right?
With the credit bureaus.
And Congress was like, what?
We need new hearings right now. Let's do it.
It actually took two years, but let's do it.
And the news coverage of the time, it could have come from this week.
In Washington, another day of hearing on the behavior of the credit bureaus
who keep records on almost everyone.
And it is eerie to listen to these old hearings.
Nothing has changed.
They trot out a figurehead from one of these credit bureaus.
We received them courteously and we discussed this Jimmy Stewart
talking gentleman was an attorney for the retail credit company.
The retail credit company was one of the largest bureaus at the time.
And this next piece of tape has no relevance, but just listen to how he talks.
And I don't blame them a bit.
See? See? See? At this hearing,
what came out was this pretty damning copy of someone's credit report.
We have a copy of this because it was filed during the hearings.
It's for a woman named Mary Wilson.
And she was having trouble finding a job, she learned,
because of what the retail credit company put in this report.
It says here that Mary is, quote, dominating, peculiar
and worst of all, quote, neurotic or psychotic.
And it does not say who said this about her.
Maybe it was her neighbor or someone she worked with.
For sure, we know it was not a doctor diagnosing her as psychotic.
It was essentially a piece of hearsay.
The 1960s senators were outraged at the retail credit company.
But instead of apologizing, what's wrong with hearsay?
The retail credit company's lawyer dug in his heels.
Hearsay is bandied around in these hearings as though it was a dirty word.
And it is. I don't know.
Congress seemed to think it was a dirty word because these hearings
spawned the first major piece of legislation to finally regulate credit bureaus.
It's called the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970.
That law and some of the amendments that would come later,
they would effectively stop credit bureaus from collecting hearsay and rumors.
They would allow consumers to see their own credit files.
They would attempt to fix errors and to limit some of the reasons
that people could pull your consumer report.
The credit reporting industry changed pretty quickly after this.
Computers meant the data could be centralized and spread more easily,
which meant you didn't need small regional bureaus in every town
to collect gossip on people.
The industry consolidated, consolidated, consolidated until eventually
there were only three big credit reporting bureaus.
And Josh Lauer, our credit historian, says the retail credit company
took such a beating during these hearings.
And in the years to come, that it decided to change its name
to something more equal sounding, more fact based.
Equal and fact based.
They changed their name to Equifax.
When we come back from the break, a new name,
a new round of congressional hearings and some new ideas
on how to fix the industry, see?

So to bring us up to the present, we know that Equifax got hacked
and we know it was much worse than what we did in the library
to the Sells Brothers' Little Blue Book.
And we should say here that we reached out to Equifax
and one of the major trade associations that represents them.
They both declined to be interviewed.
But we still had questions about what we are supposed to do now.
Hey, Chi Chi, can you hear us?
Yeah, I can hear you guys fine.
All right, good.
Chi Chi Wu is a consumer advocate.
She's a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center.
We've been telling everyone who will listen to us,
freeze your credit report at all three credit bureaus,
Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.
Those are the big three credit bureaus.
And a freeze basically means that no one is allowed to pull my credit report,
not unless I temporarily lift the freeze for them.
That way, if somebody tries to open a Gap card with my stolen information,
Gap would go and try to check my credit,
but they wouldn't be allowed because there's a freeze
and the Gap application would be denied.
Now, here's the catch.
And it depends on where you live.
But this is something that credit bureaus typically charge you to do
to protect your own information.
And then the other thing is you're going to have to pay
to temporarily lift or thaw the freeze when you do want credit.
And so you have to pay again.
Yeah.
Equifax, though, is already bowing to pressure on that.
And they're saying that they're going to remove their fees,
which seems like the very least that they could do.
But Chi Chi says this is the moment where everyone who has had a beef
over the last few decades with the credit reporting industry
is trying to change whatever it is they think is wrong with the system.
And there's a lot of beefs.
For example, people would like to see a higher accuracy standard
for the credit bureaus.
They'd like to make it easier for people to change errors in their reports.
And there's also a call to limit who is allowed
to use your credit report to judge you.
Chi Chi says this is true, especially for employers
with this sense that the credit report is some sort of proxy
for how responsible someone is.
I think Robert Smith thinks that I think if I had a bad credit score,
Robert would think less of me.
I'm just looking across the table from him right now.
And he's kind of I kind of would just pay the bills on time.
But you shouldn't because it could have been
because something bad happened to Kenny, right?
Yeah, Robert.
There's a lot of folks who miss payments or default
because they lose their job.
They get sick.
They get divorced.
You know, there's a death in the family.
A lot of times, bad credit is the result of bad luck.
This this seems to be sort of dancing around the core issue.
Why not just pass a law that says they can't have my credit
information unless I say yes?
Well, that would certainly give consumers a measure of control.
Now, how effective that would be, I'm not sure,
because in order for you to get credit,
you'd probably end up having to agree to this.
You can never leave.
They keep pulling you back in.
We're captives.
We're the product. We're the asset.
In other words, we are not and have never been the customers.
Hearing the story makes me think that like the Sells Brothers
in the 1800s really did decide the direction of the entire industry
because, you know, they could have provided letters of credit
to people like Robert Smith, the plumber back in the 1800s.
They could have provided a little laminated.
If you could laminate things, they could have provided
a little framed letter that said this person is worthy of credit.
And that way, the customer would keep control of their own information.
But they decided not to do it that way.
They decided that the money was in the businesses.
The businesses were willing to pay.
So ever since then, you and me and regular consumers have had no say.
So let's all go freeze our credit.
Welcome to the Equifax automated security freeze system.
This automated system will allow you to place or permanently
remove a security freeze from your Equifax credit file.
Who did they hire to do that?
That is someone from inside Equifax.
They're like, we need you to sound like the movie guy.
Yeah, the toughest voice you have, because we got to look tough
in these troubling times.
