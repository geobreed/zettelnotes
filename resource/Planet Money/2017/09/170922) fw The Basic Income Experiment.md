The basic income. A flat payment to citizens, without strings. Is it a progressive fever dream, or sensible policy? We may soon find out. The Finnish Government is testing it on 2,000 citizens.

The basic income is a hot topic of social policy. It's a steady payout to citizens. Liberals argue it provides support to struggling citizens with dignity and freedom. Libertarians like that it can be dispensed without an expensive, and controlling, bureaucracy. The rest argue that it's a giveaway that will inspire laziness.

#796: The Basic Income Experiment

In Finland, unemployment is 8.8 percent, and most of the time, citizens can't collect unemployment if they're making additional money, discouraging recipients from finding jobs. So the Finnish government has set up something unusual: a live experiment. A test to help settle the debate, or figure if it's even worth having. A test group of 2,000 unemployed Finns receive 560 euros each month from the government. No strings attached. For unemployed researcher Sanna Leskinen, that meant being able to apply for part time jobs and plan for the future. Avery Trufelman went to Finland to see how the experiment was working.

This week on the show: how does the basic income work in practice? And could it work in the U.S.?

Today's show is adapted from 99% Invisible, a podcast about the forces of design and architecture that shape our world.

ALEX GOLDMARK, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Goldmark. I'm the supervising producer here. And for as long as I have worked at PLANET MONEY, we've been getting one request pretty much more than all the others. In your emails and your tweets and your Facebook messages, which I really do read, there are these two words that keep coming up, that people really want us to talk about - basic income.

The idea of basic income is that the government should give citizens a check every month just for existing. The government gives the citizens this money - not enough to make everyone rich but enough so that they don't starve. It's an idea that, depending on who you talk to, can stop poverty, make the world more fair. But it could also make government smaller and more efficient and let citizens have more freedom and dignity because, the theory goes, a basic income could replace welfare and food stamps or any number of other social programs.

This is the kind of economic idea that is drumming up so much excitement and all of those emails because it has something for almost everyone. There are supporters on the left and on the right. And they all want to see this tried. But it's also one of those ideas that is just so radical that it seems like it can never really happen. So when our friends at the show 99% Invisible told us they were going to visit a country that is testing out basic income right now and that they had this great story about what it takes to get basic income to catch on, we said, yeah. We want to hear that story.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDMARK: If you don't know 99% Invisible, they are this great podcast about design. And in this episode, they bring us the clever design logic that is behind the most exciting basic-income experiment in the world right now. Host Roman Mars and reporter Avery Trufelman pick it up after this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ROMAN MARS: This is 99 percent invisible. I'm Roman Mars.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MARS: People all over the world are flirting with an idea called basic income.

(SOUNDBITE OF MEDIA MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Basic income.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Basic income.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Basic income for all...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: The idea behind the basic income is that...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: ...Each citizen receives a payment every month...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: ...As a right without conditions and paid individually.

AVERY TRUFELMAN: Basic income, also known as universal basic income or unconditional basic income, or UBI.

MARS: That's producer Avery Trufelman.

MARS: Very, very roughly defined, universal basic income is this idea that a government would pay all their citizens. And everyone would get a flat sum of money every month to cover their basic needs, whether or not they have a job. And this money would be no strings attached, with no conditions. And this would hopefully remove any stigma from receiving it. It's free money. Basically, it's free money.

MARS: The logic behind it is this, a lot of jobs don't pay enough money for people to even make rent or buy groceries. You can work full time and still be below the poverty line. So it's easy to understand why people on the left would advocate for a guaranteed income.

TRUFELMAN: But also a version of this concept is popular in libertarian circles. They see basic income as a way to shrink the welfare state. For example, you could take away food stamps, Medicare and housing subsidies and replace all of it with one flat sum.

MARS: People in tech are also interested in the concept of basic income, and they feel a certain urgency about it. Robots are coming for our jobs, they say, and basic income is the best way for humans to maintain a decent lifestyle when our labor is increasingly obsolete.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARK ZUCKERBERG: Our generation is going to have to deal with tens of millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks. But we have the potential to do so much more than that.

TRUFELMAN: That's Mark Zuckerberg giving a commencement speech at Harvard. And what he's getting at is, in a world where jobs are scarce, everyone will need a financial cushion. And then, by his logic, if people don't have to worry about food and shelter, maybe they'd feel freer to innovate. Maybe they'd start a new company or go back to school.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ZUCKERBERG: We should explore ideas like universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas.

(APPLAUSE)

MARS: Listen to that Harvard crowd. It is eating it up. Elon Musk has also advocated for UBI. And the startup incubator Y Combinator will soon begin its own pilot experiment right here in Oakland to study what happens when they give a group of people a basic income.

TRUFELMAN: It's actually an idea that's been around for a long time, and there are many different variations on it. But recently, there have been a number of experiments with forms of basic income happening around the world. A nonprofit is running an experiment with UBI in Kenya. And Ontario, Canada, just launched a test in three different cities. But this recent excitement about basic income experimentation is largely focused on Finland.

(SOUNDBITE OF MEDIA MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Finland will be the first country in the world to pilot a basic income.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Finland's experiment with universal basic income.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Is it a great idea, or was it just Finnish financial folly?

MARS: In the beginning of 2017, the Finnish government began an experiment with a basic income.

TRUFELMAN: And this news about the Finland experiment was really exciting. Maybe we will learn what people will do if they can make money without work. Will they just hang out at home? Will society grind to a halt? How will people find meaning in their lives, and how will they evaluate success?

ROOPE MOKKA: And that's, of course, the big question. It's kind of the acid test of basic income that - will receiving basic income make people more or less active, whatever the activity is, whether it's just walking around or whether it's taking care of your neighborhood's kids or applying for work.

TRUFELMAN: This is Roope Mokka.

MOKKA: Founder of Demos Helsinki - were are a Helsinki-based think tank.

TRUFELMAN: And here's what I learned talking to Roope and other people in Finland about this experiment with basic income.

MOKKA: The talk about basic income, in Finland, started before the understanding of what the outcomes of automation would be for the employment market.

TRUFELMAN: The Finland experiment is not about robots, and it's not to see if people will stop working when they get free money. The experiment is to find out if giving people basic income will actually help them start working.

MARS: And this whole experiment is especially interesting to us here at 99PI, not just for what Finland is testing but how they are testing it. Finland is trying out a unique design-oriented way of thinking about government. Rather than just rolling out laws on a massive scale, they are trying to craft legislation in stages with user feedback, like a piece of design.

TRUFELMAN: Because every good design is made to fill a need or solve a problem. And this is the problem.

SANNA LESKINEN: I hate it, to be unemployed.

TRUFELMAN: Right now, in 2017, the unemployment rate in Finland is at 8.8 percent. And that's about double the U.S. unemployment rate. And that rate is worse in smaller Finnish cities like Joensuu.

LESKINEN: Joensuu is in eastern Finland. Eastern Finland has always been poorest parts of the country.

TRUFELMAN: This is Sanna Leskinen, resident of Joensuu, which is about an hour's drive away from the Russian border. She's 39, and she's been unemployed for a little over two years.

LESKINEN: Unemployment has been, here, bigger than, say, in the southern or western Finland because we are far from bigger cities where are more - much, much, much more job opportunities.

TRUFELMAN: Sanna has a master's in history, and she worked as a researcher until her project ran out of funding. In the U.S., depending on the state, you can generally collect unemployment for about half a year after losing a job. In Finland, you can collect unemployment for about two years. And then, there are different kinds of social assistances and allowances you can apply for if you still don't have a job.

MARS: But here's the catch - if you're collecting unemployment assistance in Finland, you generally cannot earn additional income or you risk losing those benefits. And then you'd have to reapply, which is a massive drag.

LESKINEN: It's really a really difficult situation.

TRUFELMAN: This actually happened with the person we hired to record Sanna. We asked what his rate was, and he said he couldn't charge us because he is also unemployed and would lose part of his allowance if he took on money from freelance work. So he did it for free. Thanks, Jaana (ph).

MARS: Basically, the government of Finland realized that something had to be done about this system - that they were accidentally disincentivizing citizens from getting small jobs or maybe even starting businesses of their own. And these are citizens who want to work, like Sanna.

LESKINEN: Being unemployed makes me feel, anyway, sort of - I don't know - unimportant. I mean, doing a job would make you feel like you're doing something for, you know, a purpose. It's something. But being unemployed, you're just hanging around and just not being very important to anything or anybody.

TRUFELMAN: So this welfare system clearly needs to be changed. And this could be done in a few different ways, like with an earned income tax credit. But first they wanted to try out something simpler and go from there.

MARS: And this is where we get to design. They wanted to design and test policy in a process very similar to the way designers come up with new products.

MOKKA: You would design policies that - you would think about policies as kind of design objects or design services. And that means that you could do iteration and tests.

TRUFELMAN: That's Roope Mokka again, founder of the think tank Demos Helsinki. And the prime minister's office turned to them.

MOKKA: So the prime minister's office approached us and asked that - how can we employ design thinking on a national level? You know, how can we do, like, governmental-level design thinking?

MARS: Design thinking - it goes like this. First, there is a challenge or a problem that must be solved.

TRUFELMAN: Then, designers express, test and cycle.

MARS: Express.

TRUFELMAN: That means designers come up with a few ideas and prototypes.

MARS: Test.

TRUFELMAN: They try those ideas out, maybe with a model or a sample.

MOKKA: Get feedback and understand what actually happens - what are the outcomes?

TRUFELMAN: And cycle.

MARS: Incorporate that feedback to make changes and revise the design. Then the process begins again and again and again. A couple years ago, this is how the Finnish prime minister decided he wanted to design legislation. So Demos helped establish an experimentation unit, which is an actual office of the Finnish prime minister.

MOKKA: The prime minister's office's experimentation unit is the first unit that was, like, designs - policies in the kind of design thinking, meaning of the word.

TRUFELMAN: There are other governments that are interested in experimentation. But here's what makes Finland different. They want to create prototypes of laws and then change and scale and update them dynamically as the results of their experiments show what's effective and what's not.

MARS: And in order to run these experiments Finland actually had to pass a law to ensure that they were not in violation of their constitution.

MOKKA: Because all the constitutions of democratic countries in the world - they say that you have to treat people equally.

MARS: And by definition, if you're running experiments, you're not treating people equally.

MOKKA: Because they - the people who are part of the experiments - are not being treated equally. So there needed to be a special law that outlined, OK, how do the experiments fit in the constitution that says that people need to be treated equally?

TRUFELMAN: And one of the first experiments the Finnish government decided to do was with basic income because the welfare office is extensive and complicated. And rather than rejiggering one part of it and changing a bunch of stuff around and reworking their normal operations, the basic income experiment just kind of chugs along on its own. The program is currently overseen by Marjukka Turunen, who works for a government institution called KELA.

MARJUKKA TURUNEN: KELA - so that's a social insurance institution here in Finland. So I was in charge of implementing this basic income experiment - or head of it - project leader.

TRUFELMAN: There's not a lot of stigma about welfare in Finland. Everyone goes to this office every now and then in life because there are 40 different kinds of benefits that Finns can receive, including student support, paternal care, maternal care, pension subsidies and, of course, unemployment.

MARS: So in January of 2017, KELA picked 2,000 unemployed Finns at random from all over the country.

TURUNEN: In this experiment, we have 2,000 people who are getting these basic income, 560 euros per month. And so they have to be between 25 to 58. So they are not students or young people. And they are not those kind of people who will fill out their pension age during this experiment. So this is kind of like the profile of these people.

MARS: Participants didn't volunteer for the experiment. KELA just told them that they would now be receiving 560 euros a month. The news came in a letter.

LESKINEN: I got a fat, fat mail. And this said that, OK, you have been chosen to be one in this basic income experiment. And I was like, oh, what's that?

TRUFELMAN: Sanna, the unemployed researcher in Joensuu, hadn't really thought about basic income until she read that big, fat packet that came in the mail which outlined the experiment for her. Five hundred sixty euros a month would be a little less than Sanna would get on unemployment. But she'd also be able to work and not worry about losing it.

LESKINEN: So I was happy about it because two years that experiment lasts. It's going to be that money every month. And I don't have to stress that much because I am a big stressor person. I stress a lot. And finding a job was very important to me. So now I'm able to, if I find a job - like, a part-time job - I could take it and not lose the support money that usually would if I wasn't part of this basic income experiment.

TRUFELMAN: Some of the participants have been talking about their basic income with the press. But Sanna has kept it a secret.

LESKINEN: I feel embarrassed about it because it feels like I have this advantage. So I haven't been very excited about spreading that information. And now as I'm participating in this, your podcast, it's like, OK. Not many people in Finland are probably hearing about this. So I can be open about it. I'm sorry to put it this way.

MARS: I'll have you know we are huge in Finland, Sanna.

TRUFELMAN: Sanna doesn't know anyone else involved in the study. And most people in Finland don't. Her friends get kind of starstruck when she tells them her secret.

LESKINEN: I get people I know, you know, off guard with that. So, oh, you're part of that. You're the first one I've ever met. So it's like - (laughter) it's kind of funny, really.

MARS: When you collect unemployment in Finland, you have to go to these job training meetings and check-ins every couple of months. But these 2,000 participants scattered around the country don't have to do anything at all to get this 560 euros every month. Even though they're part of this experiment, they also don't have to report how they spent it.

TRUFELMAN: And at the end of the experiment, KELA will look and see if this group of unemployed people who got basic income took on work and compare it with their control group, which is the rest of the unemployed people of Finland.

TURUNEN: One hundred and seventy-five thousand people who are in the same profile that these 2,000 people are - but they are not getting this basic income. So we are comparing these two groups of people in this two-year period and see what is happening to these - how are these people behaving when they get this basic income? And how are these people behaving not getting the basic income?

MARS: And then when they compare the results, basic income might - just might - get one step closer to becoming a reality.

TURUNEN: Well, if you play with the idea that this basic income would actually come a universal basic income here in Finland, which is kind of like the idea that - I don't actually believe that is going to happen.

TRUFELMAN: You don't think that'll happen.

TURUNEN: Well, I think that there are lots of people who are not thinking this is a good idea.

TRUFELMAN: Yes, the person currently overseeing the experiment for basic income believes it won't work.

TURUNEN: I think that it would be too dramatic. So we would wipe out all of these social security systems that we have been building up for decades and then just replace it with one benefit.

TRUFELMAN: Turunen imagines that not everyone would prefer a flat income rate. Some people do need more than one base sum. Like, what if you have children or parents with special needs who you have to take care of all day? In that case, you don't have the capacity to start picking up gig work. The basic income wouldn't be enough for you.

TURUNEN: And, of course, who would pay for it? So who would finance it?

TRUFELMAN: It's really hard to say how much basic income would actually cost the average taxpayer were it to be instituted. And we don't quite know how it would affect the economy or inflation rates. It's all dependent on a number of factors, and there's no exact math on this.

MOKKA: If someone truly claims that they know how much more expensive basic income would be, I think they're lying. It's such a systemic shift that if we decide to start paying everyone a lump sum of money, it will change the economy in such a way that the whole system changes. It's, like, once again, something we have to experiment.

TRUFELMAN: Roope says that, yes, basic income would save money by cutting back on bureaucracy. But it would probably still be expensive to fund.

MOKKA: But that's almost technical. If - you know, if you need money, you raise money. It's, like, what politicians do. They change the way budgets are arranged.

TRUFELMAN: If basic income makes citizens become more active and engaged, Roope has faith that governments will find a way to pay for it because an excited and activated population is generally good for the economy. He says that's why they have to test before anything else if basic income would really increase productivity and improve general well-being. At this point, they're testing to see if it'd be worth more investigation.

LESKINEN: I really, really, really hope that this will continue to spread out - that more people are involved.

MARS: This experiment has invigorated Sanna. Even though she gets slightly less money than she would on unemployment, she is free to do whatever she wants.

LESKINEN: I am trying to find a job. I am sending applications - and take, possibly, a part-time job.

TRUFELMAN: She feels like she's about to start a new chapter. And she's ready for what's next.

LESKINEN: A tranquility of mind - it brought that to me. And it sounds funny because the amount of money is not that big. But give people hope. Give people a chance to take a moment away from that stress and that panic of, do we survive?

TRUFELMAN: It's really important to keep in mind that Sanna is just one participant in a very small study. And basic income may have helped her search for part-time work. But when I spoke with her, she had yet to actually find employment.

MARS: And, also, you probably noted that this form of basic income is not universal basic income. If it were universal, it would be money for every citizen, employed or not. In this particular experiment, the basic income is only for unemployed people.

MOKKA: Yeah. I think what we're experimenting now would be called partial, basically, in (??). This is a limited experiment. I don't know how relevant it is because a lot of groups are missing.

TRUFELMAN: If we want to see what people do when they don't have to work anymore, Roope says they should next see what happens if basic income is given to people who are already employed - to see if they then quit their jobs?

MARS: Critics of the experiment also argue that 2,000 people is too small a sample size. Two Finnish economists published an op-ed in The New York Times called "Why Finland's Basic Income Experiment Isn't Working" and said it had the potential to incentivize people to accept low-paying and low-productivity jobs.

TRUFELMAN: It's an experiment that's far from perfect but it's not supposed to be a be all, end all. Ideally, it's a first draft.

MOKKA: We cannot just consider that, you know, let's give this amount to some thousands of people. And then we'll know for sure. It's going to be other experiments before we can find out how to how to renew social security.

TRUFELMAN: Basically, if this experiment is at all successful, or even if it's not, it should lead to another experiment and then another and then another.

MARS: And Finland isn't just designing experiments with basic income. There will be experiments for what languages to teach in schools, how to change child care - everything. According to their website, the experimentation office is working on 26 key projects nationally.

TRUFELMAN: And slowly, hopefully, Finland will use the design process to figure out if it's possible or worthwhile to try radically new ideas.

MARS: Express, test and cycle.

Will we ever get a basic income experiment right here in the U.S.? It turns out we already had one decades ago. Avery explains after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MARS: So a lot of people here in the United States are talking about universal basic income. And to me, it just seems like it's just not on the table at all. I just feel like there's something about the U.S. that makes it so it would never happen here - that basic income is basically something that could only be tested in Nordic welfare states.

(LAUGHTER)

TRUFELMAN: The crazy thing about basic income is it's actually this very American idea. And it was first proposed - or at least kind of first mentioned by American Founding Father Thomas Paine. We've actually been down this road before as a nation here in the United States. We did some studies with basic income back in the '70s.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RICHARD NIXON: I shall ask to change the framework of government itself.

MARS: That's Richard Nixon.

TRUFELMAN: Richard Nixon wanted to see if he could guarantee a family of four $1,600 a year which is equivalent to, like, $10,000 today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NIXON: Let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in America. Let us provide the means by which more can help themselves.

MARS: Wow (laughter).

TRUFELMAN: And so yeah. And then he decided to really try and do it. Tens of millions of dollars were budgeted so that more than 8,500 Americans could be involved in experiments all around the country. And there were a bunch of different ones. And they tested, like, different variations of basic income and different ideas around it.

MARS: And so why haven't I heard of these at all?

TRUFELMAN: Well, people started analyzing the results before all the data was in. And so there were, like, these rumors swirling around that people were dropping out of the workforce and just, like, enjoying this basic income. And it wasn't actually a statistically significant trend. It was just kind of a rumor...

MARS: Right.

TRUFELMAN: ...Which can sometimes be more powerful than a fact. And there were also all these reports of increased separation and divorce rates. And that was considered really scandalous and set off a lot of opposition. But then when the data was actually analyzed, it wasn't as large as it seemed. There weren't that many more divorces. There were a few. But this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

MARS: Totally. Yeah.

TRUFELMAN: Yeah.

MARS: It just stopped the economic slavery of women in marriage.

TRUFELMAN: Exactly. Exactly.

MARS: That's not so bad (laughter).

TRUFELMAN: Yeah. But the American public didn't have the patience for nuance. And they were like, this will be the end of the family unit. So we can't tolerate it. And it's all just because, like, they started chatting about it before they had the numbers.

ELIZABETH RHODES: You know, it was kind of disregarded before we really had a chance to fully analyze the data.

TRUFELMAN: This is Elizabeth Rhodes. And she is the research director of a basic income study that is happening at Y Combinator research. And she is helping to launch a basic income experiment here in Oakland.

RHODES: We're doing a sort of a pre-pilot, a small group to sort of test some of the logistics, and preparing for a larger, randomized, controlled trial that we hope to launch next year.

TRUFELMAN: After that local test, they want to really expand it.

RHODES: We're actually looking to do two U.S. states and broader regions within two states.

TRUFELMAN: They have definitely learned from these early experiments to start small, expand slowly and to not promise too much because, you know, they want to wait for this experiment to fully play out.

RHODES: The study is going to run, you know, for several years. And so I don't expect to see, you know, changes overnight in any way. And so I think we really need to give it time.

TRUFELMAN: So in doing this research about basic income, I've come across a thousand polarizing think pieces that are either like, UBI is a great idea, and we should do this right now or like, this is a terrible idea, and we need to stop it. But, realistically, it's going to be years before we know what we can learn from this privatized American experiment or from the Finnish experiment, for that matter. No one has solid answers yet about what basic income would mean for the national tax code or inflation or unemployment rates or the economy or the robots or our happiness and well-being. And right now all we know is that different experimenters all around the world are trying to figure out some answers. But we just don't know them yet.

MARS: So this is going to end like all radio stories end, which is, time will tell.

TRUFELMAN: (Laughter).

MARS: Only time will tell.

TRUFELMAN: But for now, time will tell.

MARS: (Laughter) Well, thanks, Avery.

TRUFELMAN: Thanks, Roman.

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Alex Goldmark. I'm the supervising producer here.
And for as long as I have worked at Planet Money, we've been getting one request pretty much more
than all the others in your emails and your tweets and your Facebook messages, which I really
do read. There are these two words that keep coming up that people really want us to talk
about. Basic income. The idea of basic income is that the government should give citizens
a check every month just for existing. The government gives the citizens this money.
Not enough to make everyone rich, but enough so that they don't starve. It's an idea that,
depending on who you talk to, can stop poverty, make the world more fair.
But it could also make governments smaller and more efficient and let citizens have more
freedom and dignity. Because, the theory goes, a basic income could replace welfare and food
stamps or any number of other social programs. This is the kind of economic idea that is drumming
up so much excitement and all of those emails because it has something for almost everyone.
There are supporters on the left and on the right, and they all want to see this tried.
But it's also one of those ideas that is just so radical that it seems like
it can never really happen. So when our friends at the show 99% Invisible told us
they were going to visit a country that is testing out basic income right now and that they
had this great story about what it takes to get basic income to catch on, we said, yeah,
we want to hear that story. If you don't know 99% Invisible, they are this great podcast
about design. And in this episode, they bring us the clever design logic that is behind the
most exciting basic income experiment in the world right now. Host Roman Mars and
reporter Avery Trusselman pick it up after this.

This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.
People all over the world are flirting with an idea called basic income.
Basic income. Basic income. Basic income for all.
The idea behind the basic income is that each citizen receives a payment every month.
As a right without conditions and paid individually.
Basic income, also known as universal basic income or unconditional basic income or UBI.
That's producer Avery Trusselman.
Very very roughly defined universal basic income is this idea that a government would pay all
their citizens and everyone would get a flat sum of money every month to cover their basic
needs whether or not they have a job. And this money would be no strings attached
with no conditions and this would hopefully remove any stigma from receiving it.
It's free money basically. It's free money.
The logic behind it is this.
A lot of jobs don't pay enough money for people to even make rent or buy groceries.
You can work full time and still be below the poverty line.
So it's easy to understand why people on the left would advocate for a guaranteed income.
But also a version of this concept is popular in libertarian circles.
They see basic income as a way to shrink the welfare state.
For example, you could take away food stamps, Medicare and housing subsidies and
replace all of it with one flat sum.
People in tech are also interested in the concept of basic income
and they feel a certain urgency about it.
Robots are coming for our jobs they say.
And basic income is the best way for humans to maintain a decent lifestyle
when our labor is increasingly obsolete.
Our generation is going to have to deal with tens of millions of jobs
replaced by automation like self-driving cars and trucks.
But we have the potential to do so much more than that.
That's Mark Zuckerberg giving a commencement speech at Harvard.
And what he's getting at is in a world where jobs are scarce,
everyone will need a financial cushion.
And then, by his logic, if people don't have to worry about food and shelter,
maybe they'd feel freer to innovate.
Maybe they'd start a new company or go back to school.
We should explore ideas like universal basic income
to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas.
Listen to that Harvard crowd that is eating it up.
Elon Musk has also advocated for UBI
and the startup incubator Y Combinator
will soon begin its own pilot experiment right here in Oakland
to study what happens when they give a group of people a basic income.
It's actually an idea that's been around for a long time
and there are many different variations on it.
But recently, there have been a number of experiments
with forms of basic income happening around the world.
A nonprofit is running an experiment with UBI in Kenya
and Ontario, Canada just launched a test in three different cities.
But this recent excitement about basic income experimentation
is largely focused on Finland.
Finland will be the first country in the world to pilot a basic income.
Finland's experiment with universal basic income.
Is it a great idea or is it just Finnish financial folly?
In the beginning of 2017,
the Finnish government began an experiment with a basic income.
And this news about the Finland experiment was really exciting.
Maybe we will learn what people will do
if they can make money without work.
Will they just hang out at home?
Will society grind to a halt?
How will people find meaning in their lives
and how will they evaluate success?
And that's of course the big question.
It's the kind of the acid test of basic income
that will receiving basic income make people more or less active?
Whatever the activity is,
whether it's just walking around
or whether it's taking care of your neighborhood kids
or applying for work.
This is Rope Mokka.
Founder of Demos Helsinki.
We are a Helsinki-based think tank.
And here's what I learned
talking to Rope and other people in Finland
about this experiment with basic income.
To talk about basic income in Finland
started before the understanding
of what the outcomes of automation would be
for the employment market.
The Finland experiment is not about robots
and it's not to see if people will stop working
when they get free money.
The experiment is to find out
if giving people basic income
will actually help them start working.
And this whole experiment
is especially interesting to us here at 99PI
not just for what Finland is testing
but how they are testing it.
Finland is trying out a unique design-oriented way
of thinking about government.
Rather than just rolling out laws on a massive scale,
they are trying to craft legislation in stages
with user feedback like a piece of design.
Because every good design is made to fill a need
or solve a problem.
And this is the problem.
I hate it to be unemployed.
Right now in 2017,
the unemployment rate in Finland is at 8.8%.
And that's about double the U.S. unemployment rate.
And that rate is worse in smaller Finnish cities
like Joensuu.
Joensuu is in eastern Finland.
Eastern Finland has always been
poorest parts of the country.
This is Sana Leskianen, resident of Joensuu,
which is about an hour's drive away
from the Russian border.
She's 39 and she's been unemployed
for a little over two years.
Unemployment has been here bigger
than say in southern or western Finland
because we are far from bigger cities
where are much, much, much more job opportunities.
Sana has a master's in history
and she worked as a researcher
until her project ran out of funding.
In the U.S., depending on the state,
you can generally collect unemployment
for about half a year after losing a job.
In Finland, you can collect unemployment
for about two years.
And then there are different kinds
of social assistances and allowances
you can apply for
if you still don't have a job.
But here's the catch.
If you're collecting unemployment assistance
in Finland, you generally cannot earn
additional income or you risk losing
those benefits.
And then you'd have to reapply,
which is a massive drag.
It's really, really difficult situation.
This actually happened with the person
we hired to record Sana.
We asked what his rate was
and he said he couldn't charge us
because he is also unemployed
and would lose part of his allowance
if he took on money from freelance work.
So he did it for free.
Thanks, Sana.
Basically, the government of Finland
realized that something had to be done
about this system.
That they were accidentally
disincentivizing citizens
from getting small jobs
or maybe even starting businesses
of their own.
And these are citizens
who want to work like Sana.
Being unemployed makes me feel anyway
sort of, I don't know, unimportant.
I mean, doing a job would make you
feel like you're doing something
for, you know, a purpose
and something.
But being unemployed,
you're just hanging around
and just not being very important
to anything or anybody.
So this welfare system
clearly needs to be changed.
And this could be done
in a few different ways,
like with an earned income tax credit.
But first they wanted to try out
something simpler and go from there.
And this is where we get to design.
They wanted to design and test policy
in a process very similar
to the way designers come up
with new products.
You would design policies
that you would think about policies
as kind of design objects
or design services.
And that means that you could do
iteration and tests.
That's Rope Moka again,
founder of the think tank
Demos Helsinki.
And the prime minister's office
turned to them.
So the prime minister's office
approached us and asked that
how can we employ design thinking
on a national level?
You know, how can we do like
governmental level design thinking?
Design thinking.
It goes like this.
First, there is a challenge
or problem that must be solved.
Then designers express, test
and cycle.
Express.
That means designers come up
with a few ideas and prototypes.
Test.
They try those ideas out.
Maybe with a model or a sample.
Get feedback and understand
what actually happens.
What are the outcomes?
And cycle.
Incorporate that feedback
to make changes and revise the design.
Then the process begins again
and again and again.
A couple years ago,
this is how the Finnish prime minister
decided he wanted to design legislation.
So Demos helped establish
an experimentation unit,
which is an actual office
of the Finnish prime minister.
The prime minister's office
is an experimentation unit.
It's the first unit that
plus like designs policies
in the kind of design thinking
meaning of the word.
There are other governments
that are interested in experimentation,
but here's what makes Finland different.
They want to create prototypes of laws
and then change and scale
and update them dynamically
as a result of their design.
Most of their experiments
show what's effective and what's not.
And in order to run these experiments,
Finland actually had to pass a law
to ensure that they were not
in violation of their constitution.
Because all the constitutions
of democratic countries in the world,
they say that you have to
treat people equally.
And by definition,
if you're running experiments,
you're not treating people equally.
Because they, the people
who are part of the experiments
are not being treated equally.
So there needed to be a special law
outlined that, okay, how do
the experiments fit in the constitution
that says that people need
to be treated equally.
And one of the first experiments
the Finnish government decided to do
was with basic income.
Because the welfare office
is extensive and complicated
and rather than rejiggering
one part of it
and changing a bunch of stuff around
and reworking their normal operations,
the basic income experiment
just kind of chugs along on its own.
The program is currently
overseen by Mariuka Turunen,
who works for a government institution
called Kela.
Kela, so that's a social insurance
institution here in Finland.
So I was in charge of implementing
this basic income experiment
or head of it, project leader.
There's not a lot of stigma
about welfare in Finland.
Everyone goes to this office
every now and then in life
because there are 40 different kinds
of benefits that Finns can receive,
including student support,
paternal care, maternal care,
pension subsidies
and of course, unemployment.
So in January of 2017
Kela picked 2,000 unemployed Finns
at random from all over the country.
In this experiment
we have 2,000 people
who are getting this basic income
560 euros per month
and so they have to be
between 25 to 58
so they are not students
or young people
and they are not those kind of people
who will fill out their pension age
during this experiment.
So this is kind of like
the profile of these people.
Participants didn't volunteer
for the experiment.
Kela just told them
that they would now be receiving
560 euros a month.
The news came in a letter.
I got a fat, fat mail
and just said that,
okay, you have been chosen
to be one
in this basic income experiment
and I was like,
oh, what's that?
Sana, the unemployed researcher
in Joensuu
hadn't really thought
about basic income
until she read that big fat packet
that came in the mail
which outlined the experiment for her.
560 euros a month
would be a little less
than Sana would get
on unemployment
but she would also be able to work
and not worry about losing it.
So I was happy about it
because two years
that experiment lasts
it's going to be that money every month
and I don't have to stress that much
because I am a big
stressor person.
I stress a lot
and finding a job
was very important to me.
So now I'm able
if I find a job
like a part-time job
I could take it
and not lose the support money
that usually would
if I wasn't part
of this basic income experiment.
Some of the participants
have been talking
about their basic income
with the press
but Sana has kept it a secret.
I feel embarrassed about it
because it feels like
I have this advantage
so I haven't been very excited
about spreading that information
and now as I'm participating this
your podcast is like
okay not many many people
in Finland
are probably hearing about this
so I could be open about it.
I'm sorry to put it this way.
I'll have you know
we are huge in Finland, Sana.
Sana doesn't know
anyone else involved in the study
and most people in Finland don't.
Her friends get kind of starstruck
when she tells them her secret.
I get people
you know off-guard with that
so oh you're part of that
you're the first one I've ever met
so I was like
he's kind of funny really.
When you collect unemployment in Finland
you have to go to these job training
meetings and check-ins
every couple of months
but these 2,000 participants
scattered around the country
don't have to do anything at all
to get this 560 euros every month
even though they're part
of this experiment
they also don't have to report
how they spent it.
And at the end of the experiment
Kela will look and see
if this group of unemployed people
who got basic income
took on work
and compare it
with their control group
which is the rest
of the unemployed people of Finland.
175,000 people
who are in the same profile
than these 2,000 people are
but they are not getting
this basic income
so we are comparing
these two groups of people
in this two years period
and see what is happening to these
how are these people behaving
when they get this basic income
and how are these people behaving
not getting the basic income.
And then when they compare the results
basic income might
just might get one step closer
to becoming a reality.
Well, if you play with the idea
that this basic income
would actually come
a universal basic income
here in Finland
which is kind of like the idea
that I don't actually believe
that it is going to happen.
You don't think it will happen?
Well, I think that there are
lots of people who
are not thinking
this is a good idea.
Yes, the person currently
overseeing the experiment
for basic income
believes it won't work.
I think that it would be
too dramatic.
So we would wipe out
the whole of this
social security system
that we have been building up
for decades
and then just replace it
with one benefit.
Toronin imagines that
not everyone would prefer
a flat income rate.
Some people do need
more than one base sum.
Like what if you have children
or parents with special needs
who you have to take care of all day.
In that case
you don't have the capacity
to start picking up gig work.
The basic income
wouldn't be enough for you.
And of course
who would pay for it?
So who would finance it?
It's really hard to say
how much basic income
would actually cost
the average taxpayer
were it to be instituted.
And we don't quite know
how it would affect the economy
or inflation rates.
It's all dependent
on a number of factors
and there's no exact math on this.
If someone truly claims
that they know
how much more expensive
basic income would be
I think they're lying.
It's such a systemic shift
that if we decide
to start paying everyone
a lump sum of money
it will change the economy
in such a way
that the whole system changes.
It's once again
something we have to experiment.
Rope says that yes
basic income would save money
by cutting back on bureaucracy
but it will probably still
be expensive to fund.
But that's almost technical.
If you need money
you raise money.
It's like what politicians do.
They change the way
budgets are arranged.
If basic income makes citizens
become more active and engaged
Rope has faith
that governments will
find a way to pay for it
because an excited
and activated population
is generally good for the economy.
He says that's why
they have to test
before anything else
if basic income
would really increase productivity
and improve general well-being.
At this point
they're testing to see
if it'd be worth
more investigation.
I really, really, really hope
that this will continue
and just spread out
that more people are involved.
This experiment has invigorated Sanna.
Even though she gets
slightly less money
than she would on unemployment
she is free to do
whatever she wants.
I am trying to find a job.
I'm sending applications
and take possibly a part-time job.
She feels like she's about
to start a new chapter
and she's ready for what's next.
A tranquility of mind
it brought that to me
and it sounds funny
because the amount of money
is not that big
but they give people hope
give people a chance
to take a moment
away from that stress
and that panic of
do we survive?
It's really important
to keep in mind
that Sanna is just one participant
in a very small study
and basic income
may have helped her search
for part-time work
but when I spoke with her
she had yet to actually
find employment.
And also you probably noted
that this form of basic income
is not universal basic income.
If it were universal
it would be money
for every citizen employed or not.
In this particular experiment
the basic income
is only for unemployed people.
Yeah I think what we're experimenting
now would be called
partial basic income.
This is a limited experiment.
I don't know how relevant it is
because a lot of groups are missing.
If we want to see what people do
when they don't have to work anymore
Rope says they should
next see what happens
if basic income is given to people
who are already employed
to see if they then quit their jobs.
Critics of the experiment
also argue that
2,000 people is too small
a sample size.
Two Finnish economists
published an op-ed
in the New York Times called
Why Finland's Basic Income Experiment
Isn't Working
and said it had the potential
to incentivize people
to accept low-paying
and low-productivity jobs.
It's an experiment
that's far from perfect
but it's not supposed to be
a be-all end-all.
Ideally it's a first draft.
We cannot just consider that
let's give this amount
to some thousands of people
and then we'll know for sure
there's going to be
other experiments
before we can find out
how to renew social security.
Basically if this experiment
is at all successful
or even if it's not
it should lead to
another experiment
and then another
and then another.
And Finland isn't just designing
experiments with basic income
there will be experiments
for what languages
to teach in schools
how to change child care
everything.
According to their website
the experimentation office
is working on
26 key projects nationally.
And slowly, hopefully
Finland will use
the design process
to figure out if it's possible
or worthwhile
to try radically new ideas.
Express, test, and cycle.
Will we ever get a basic income
experiment right here in the U.S.?
It turns out we already had one
decades ago.

So a lot of people here
in the United States
are talking about
universal basic income
and to me it just seems like
it's just not on the table at all.
I just feel like
there's something about the U.S.
that makes it so
it would never happen here.
That basic income
is basically something
that could only be tested
in Nordic welfare states.
The crazy thing about basic income
is it's actually
this very American idea
and it was first proposed
or at least kind of first mentioned
by American founding father
Thomas Paine.
We've actually been down
this road before as a nation
here in the United States.
We did some studies
with basic income
back in the 70s.
I shall ask to change
the framework of government itself.
That's Richard Nixon.
Richard Nixon wanted to see
if he could guarantee
a family of four
$1,600 a year
which is equivalent
to like $10,000 today.
Let us place a floor
under the income of every family
with children in America.
Let us provide the means
by which more can help themselves.
Wow.
And so, yeah,
and then he decided
to really try and do it.
Tens of millions of dollars
were budgeted
so that more than 8,500 Americans
could be involved in experiments
all around the country.
And there are a bunch
of different ones
and they tested
like different variations
of basic income
and different ideas around it.
And so why haven't
I heard of these at all?
Well, people started
analyzing the results
before all the data was in.
And so there were like
these rumors swirling around
that people were dropping
out of the workforce
and just like enjoying
this basic income.
And it wasn't actually
a statistically significant trend.
It was just kind of a rumor
which can sometimes
be more powerful than a fact.
And there were also
all these reports
of increased separation
and divorce rates.
And that was considered
really scandalous
and set off a lot of opposition.
But then when the data
was actually analyzed,
it wasn't as large as it seems.
There weren't that many more divorces.
There were a few,
but this wasn't necessarily
a bad thing.
Totally.
It just stopped
the economic slavery of women.
Exactly.
That's not so bad.
Yeah, but the American public
didn't have the patience for nuance
and they were like
this will be the end
of the family unit.
So we can't tolerate it.
And it's all just because
they started chatting about it
before they had the numbers.
It was kind of disregarded
before we really had a chance
to fully analyze the data.
This is Elizabeth Rhodes
and she is the research director
of a basic income study
that is happening
at Y Combinator Research.
And she is helping to launch
a basic income experiment
here in Oakland.
We're doing a pre-pilot,
a small group
to sort of test
some of the logistics
and preparing for a larger
randomized control trial
that we hope to launch next year.
After that local test,
they want to really expand it.
We're actually looking to do
two U.S. states
in broader regions
within two states.
They have definitely learned
from these early experiments
to start small,
expand slowly,
and to not promise too much.
Because they want to wait
for this experiment
to fully play out.
The study is going to run
for several years.
And so I don't expect
to see changes
overnight in any way.
And so I think
we really need to give it time.
So in doing this research
about basic income,
I've come across
a thousand polarizing think pieces
that are either like
UBI is a great idea
and we should do this right now.
Or like this is a terrible idea
and we need to stop it.
But realistically,
it's going to be years
before we know
what we can learn
from this privatized
American experiment.
Or from the Finnish experiment
for that matter.
No one has solid answers yet
about what basic income
would mean
for the national tax code
or inflation
or unemployment rates
or the economy
or the robots
or our happiness
and well-being.
And right now all we know
is that different experimenters
all around the world
are trying to figure out
some answers.
We just don't know them yet.
So this is going to end
like all radio stories
which is time will tell.
Only time will tell.
But for now time will tell.
