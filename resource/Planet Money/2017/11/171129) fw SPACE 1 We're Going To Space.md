We really are going to space.

Last year we started to look into the satellite business. It used to be that satellites were the size of a school bus and cost a half billion dollars. But the space business is changing. Private companies are competing to get tiny satellites into orbit, driving the cost down. Commercial rockets are launching around the world, carrying satellites for universities, and farmers, and oil traders.
Planet Money
SPACE 1: We're Going To Space

So we, thought, what about podcasts? Who speaks for them? Why can't they go, too? Today on the show, we go looking for our own satellite.

Along the way, we meet the father of the satellite revolution, who scaled spacecraft down to the size of a box that could hold a beanie baby, and started a revolution in orbit. We visit a satellite conference and make a few offers. And we go to Planet Labs in San Francisco, a little startup that is sending up hundreds of satellites.

**faster whisper:**
When we decided to go see a rocket launch I thought you know somehow we would get to stand sort of close to it
You know like on TV
You see the rocket towering above you and all the flames and the smoke a billowing smoke everywhere, right?
But of course the rocket people made a stand miles away. It makes sense
They took us on this old converted school bus down a little dirt road
And then they let us out in the middle of nowhere
It's a field of scrub brush the Pacific Ocean is off in the distance
The only sign of civilization is a couple of blue porta potties just in case
But somewhere just over the ridge is one of humanity's greatest achievements, right a rocket
It is called the Minotaur see it is a hundred feet tall and it is the rocket
We have been waiting to see for the last eight months. It's worth 40 million dollars
It's carrying a bunch of very sophisticated satellites, but everyone stands around and acts like oh, this is no big deal
One of the executives from the rocket company John Steinmeier. He makes it sound
Routine it's been a long period of time where we've worked with the customer to integrate their satellites
Onto our launch vehicle make sure everything's compatible and everything will work
Well, once they're deployed you use all these words like vehicle, but that's like a rocket
If rocket is more exciting we can call them rockets
It's definitely more exciting than vehicle
But in the space business boring is good
That's what they're going for boring means that the customers are all happy and there was no embarrassing video footage of a rocket
Exploding over our heads the only drama out here comes over a set of walkie talkies. That is the only way
We know what's going on
Nominal is our favorite word
Everything is okay
That is I think the most sort of calm if there's a word that is calmer than nominal I've never heard it
So if someone says it is non nominal
Probably off nominal nominal nominal. That means big trouble
But we were excited we were taking selfies we'd snuck in a bottle of champagne because this might be nominal for everybody else
But for us, this might be the single biggest moment in Planet Money history because just over that horizon on
top of the Minotaur sea rocket is
The Planet Money
Satellite it is a little hunk of technology that we have adopted that we have been following for months
We've even etched the waveform of our voices our
Voices on the side of the satellite if this actually works Planet Money is going to space
It's one minute. It's one minute. I mean weirdly enough like I'm most afraid
I'm most afraid that it's just gonna be boring. No, but I'm not gonna be able to see anything
Because he keeps holding his finger up silently
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Robert Smith and I'm Stacey Vanik Smith
Today on the show we boldly go where no podcast has gone before
space a decade ago this crazy stunt a Planet Money satellite would never have been possible space was so expensive that only
Governments and corporations could afford to launch a satellite
But everything is changing in the space business right now private rocket companies are driving down the price of launches
Satellites have shrunk so much you can hold them in the palm of your hand. It's becoming so easy
Even we can do it. So over the next few episodes of Planet Money
We're gonna try to make sense of this new industry by going to space ourselves
Getting a satellite took us from rural, Kentucky to Silicon Valley to New Zealand
And there are so many things that can go wrong
I mean, can you really build a working satellite on the cheap and even if you do what can the satellite do in space?
And even if you come up with a mission, what if after all this work the rocket the rocket just disappears off the radar?
We have negative telemetry in the center here. It was just hoping you could confirm the track of the vehicle via radar
That means they've lost contact with it. I think everybody's waiting. Everybody's crowded around them walkie-talkie
and work

Okay, we have to be honest with you. The Planet Money satellite started out as a joke around the office about eight months ago
We were brainstorming new projects. You may remember that Planet Money already made a t-shirt and followed it around the globe
We did a project where we drilled for oil and turned it into gasoline and we're all joking
Oh, you know, what's next, you know space our editor
Brian had just seen something about a SpaceX launch on the little news TV that's in our elevator and we all laughed and you
Know I immediately started to sketch a mission patch, you know, every space mission has a patch for its jumpsuit
So I'm like, oh if we ever did this, you know
We could put a squirrel on it and our names on the mission patch and we were all excited and talking about it
But it seemed really impossible. I mean, first of all, we obviously weren't going to get on a rocket
No, and even a satellite just seemed really out of our league
There are only a couple thousand active satellites in orbit and they are almost exclusively owned by like spy
Agencies and governments and multi-billion dollar corporations and imagine what it takes to build one of these satellites
I mean, I didn't know this before but they are huge the kind of satellites that provide
GPS for our phones or cable TV or predict the weather those satellites can be as big as a school bus
They're so complicated so expensive they can cost a half billion dollars
But one of our producers Elizabeth culasse was really captivated by this and she decided to look into it
She came back super excited and she said well, wait a minute Elizabeth come in here
What did they tell you they said it is actually the perfect time to go to space
We are in the middle of a satellite revolution. These satellites are getting smaller and cheaper and it's easier to get to space
It's like the early days of personal computers or when the internet was invented
It is wild out there right now and we can get in on it
I still wasn't completely sure that it was possible
But you know, I thought fine fine we'll get a guide
Maybe someone who can show us a possible way into this industry and everyone kept talking about one person in particular
Apparently that the Steve Jobs of the satellite revolution. He was a guy who showed the world that anyone could go to space
He works in Kentucky. His name is Bob Twiggs
When we first spot professor Twiggs, he is surrounded by third graders a few kids run around
It is field trip day at the Space Science Center at Morehead State University
I think you ought to interview them there are future graduate students
Bob has white hair and he waves his hands around with excitement
Maybe it's the kids but he reminds me of one of those owl characters in a Disney film as an early pioneer in satellites
He could be running a billion dollar corporation
But he decided to stay in academia and instead what he does is get students excited about space
It's kind of like jump-starting a car
You know
I think I'm like the the guy with a battery pack on my back and I go around to the students and I
Jump-start the students and once they get running then I can stand out of the road and they they learn more on their own than
I can teach them and that is how Bob changed the satellite industry in the late 1990s
He was teaching graduate engineering students at Stanford and he figured they would be way more excited about designing
Satellites if they actually got to build one in class
But with something as big and as complicated as a satellite
This was a tough assignment
The bigger it is the more things that they want to put in it and they just keep designing
Oh we can add this and we can add that Bob was working with another researcher from a university down the road Cal Poly
His name was Jordy push Swarie and they thought what if they give the students a constraint a tiny box
They had to fit all of the electronics into so it would go faster
So he goes down to a store in Mountain View, California
One of those places like a container store, you know, they sell all kinds of boxes
You know that you're gonna put your favorite baseball in or your favorite basketball
Oh, so you were walking up and down the aisles saying too big too big too small. That's wrong
That's right. And then you saw I saw a four inch box and that at the time, you know
There was the beanie baby craze. So that was the box that they put the beanie babies in
You know, you buy it get a beanie baby and display it on the shelf
This satellite started from a beanie baby box
Luckily Bob did not call his invention a beanie baby satellite never name your technology after a fad instead
He called it the cube satellite cube sat the cube sat and the original cube sat is inside the trophy case at Morehead State
University Bob's boss Ben Malfras drags us over to see it
He is so proud of this dusty plastic cube and this is a great opportunity because the original model I predict one day
Will be in the Smithsonian and Bob puts this box in front of his students and says
Anything you want your satellite to do has to fit in here
You can't add more parts make the satellite bigger you students you have to think smaller
The general aerospace industry said that's the dumbest idea we've ever seen those
Academic guys are out of their mind because it's so small. It's not useful for anything
Remember the aerospace industry was sending up satellites the size of a boss
And here is this researcher holding up something a little larger than a Rubik's Cube and saying this is satellite, too
It didn't make any sense. This was not an evolution to a slightly smaller product
This was a revolution and everything about what was inside of a satellite had to be rethought
And this might have stayed an academic exercise for the fine students at Stanford
Except there was this other revolution going on at the same time
This was the early 2000s and very early smartphones were just being invented
And all those tiny phone transmitters and processors and cameras just happened to fit into a beanie baby box
All of a sudden satellites were so small that students could take risks. They could try new things
They could design a tiny satellite to take pictures of the Arctic or measure magnetic waves to predict earthquakes
And when you take risks with a new technology, that's when business innovation happens
The personal computer revolution didn't start when computers were the size of an entire room
It started when computers were small enough to play around with to take risks with in a garage
That's how Apple started the same with satellites private companies looked at this and they said oh
I can think of a million things to do with a CubeSat Bob remembers visiting a company recently in San Francisco called planets
They make satellites that take pictures of the earth and they have almost an assembly line process now for making CubeSats
It's fun to go in there and see a shelf with 50 satellites setting on it
Never thought I'd see that how long would that have taken you back in the day? Oh
My at the rate we were building him almost 50 years. Bob told us look it's pretty easy
Like even a podcast could build their own CubeSat
They do make kits for this and you could probably make something that you know
It goes beep beep beep in space for you know under ten thousand dollars and you know beeping in space. That's cool
Right, I mean that's that's better than beeping on the ground
But I kind of thought we'd have a satellite that could do something cool like take pictures of North Korea or track cargo ships
Or monitor global warming. Yeah for that level of satellite. We're gonna have to make some difficult decisions
We're gonna need to go shopping for our very own CubeSat. There is apparently a Walmart of satellites
It is the small satellite conference in Logan, Utah like small satellite conference or small satellite
Conference the satellites are small. The conference is massive
Oh my god, it's a robot. It's a robot. I
Think it's a robot
Once upon a time the small satellite conference was for academics
Scientists who are building hardware and data analysts and and they are still here and a lot of students too
But these days you can smell the money in the air
The big rocket companies are here
SpaceX blue origin rocket lab and every 20 feet you can stop by a booth of some start-up satellite company giving away little
Light up keychains and foam rocket ships and Bob's tiny CubeSats are everywhere
It is an industry standard now. You can get a single box
It is called a one you as in one Beanie Baby unit. So just this basic just the basics
Just this basic thing. I'm holding in my hand. It's like a frame with some electronics in it
Is $10,000 right very doable, right? Of course, then you have to fill up the CubeSat
There are booths that will sell you powerful cameras radiation monitors might preach at the booth for Millennium Space Systems
Says it could get expensive. You have to have power you need some sort of computer
You need a way to navigate know where you are in space in the sky
And those things just take time to develop and every single mission is unique in that case
You might want to upgrade to a three you satellite as in three Beanie Baby units
Yeah, and the booth for the company Blue Canyon has a bunch of cool shiny floor models
So I asked Dan Hagel if we wanted your basic model like you're just your cheapest stripped down
Box with some electronics. What range of cost are we talking about?
All right equipment is probably the highest and that you're gonna find in this category, but it's still
Fraction the price of a traditional spacecraft you want it. Do you want to drop the sticker price on me? What's it gonna be?
Well, let's say well under a million under a million
You can hear our producer Elizabeth
Laughing out loud at that price tag. I mean compared to the half billion dollar communication satellite
these are a bargain, but we were thinking maybe more in the like
Thousands or hundreds of dollars range, you know, I actually talked to them about a used satellite
They looked at me like I was crazy like where you can find a used
Satellite eBay. It's always on eBay, you know, I figured we could always play the nonprofit card
You know the sort of charity impulse. So, you know, we started to talk to people at the conference about who might
Lend us a satellite, you know for journalistic purposes allow us to adopt one for a short mission
We called everybody who makes satellites saying hey, do you have an extra satellite?
Can we jump on board with your satellite? We begged we begged we maybe just put our name on a satellite
Maybe do something cool with it and one company said
Let's talk about it. Why don't you drop by our office? It's in San Francisco and we can discuss this proposal
It was in fact the company that Bob twigs had mentioned that he visited in San Francisco the company with the strangely similar name to
ours
Planet I felt like this was a good sign
It's open. Oh, thanks
Planet San Francisco office is right down the street from the headquarters of Twitter and uber and they're going for the same tech startup vibe
Although because it is space hardware. I have to sign a promise not to steal any military secrets
Confidential information show me any technical non-technical like my Apple terms of service contract
I did not read the fine print signed it anyway, and now I can legally enjoy my tour
It starts in mission control with the launch director
Which sounds way more serious than it is like Safian is 29 years old pretty laid-back guy
And mission control looks like the back of a best buy a bunch of tvs on the wall and hardware piled on the desks
We have satellites lying around everywhere
And so there's like four or five of them in a cabinet here. Yes, and that that's just for starters
So there's another cabinet full of satellites over there now. You just show it off. Yeah
The reason they have so many is that planet's business model is changing the way we take pictures of the earth
I mean, we've all seen those satellite photos on google maps, right?
Everyone checks their house everyone checks their house and those pictures were taken by big satellites that
Basically only get a good shot of your house every six months or a year
But planet thought hey with all of these little cube sats
Why wait for one big satellite to trundle by?
Why not launch hundreds of small ones build them faster launch them faster take more risks?
It's the cube sat way
Mike shows me a tv and back with an image of the earth and you can see all these little dots
You know, maybe 200 of them each one is a satellite that planet has in orbit over hawaii
Alaska
Over the north pole. You have a big string of satellites going down over the united kingdom looks like through
France spain through each one of those little satellites is up in space
300 miles up and they whip around the globe from the north pole to the south pole
Then back to the north pole again every 90 minutes taking pictures the whole way north pole south pole north pole south pole
If you could float in space and see it
It would look like what would appear to be like a string of pearls going over roughly the north pole from north to south
And as the string of pearls is rotating in its orbit
The earth is rotating underneath and so that that line of satellites acts as a line scanner
And so they're slowly sweeping across the earth's surface every 24 hours
And that enables us to get an image of every place a picture of almost every place on earth every 24 hours
The way it works is that no matter where you are on earth at around 10 o'clock in the morning when you're just getting coffee
There is almost certainly a tiny planet satellite whizzing by over your head and taking a picture
It is mind-boggling and you know when planet first started to launch its satellites a few years ago
They would name each one and have these big ceremonies now. They have so many it is totally routine
so routine
Would a company like this even notice if public radio podcasts just you know
Borrowed a satellite for a little while. Maybe we could push a couple tote bags their way. And so we asked
Can we have one?
I mean not to keep you know, just to borrow it for a little while like no money changing hands. No contract
just a sort of temporary adoption situation
And some calls were made up the management chain and they said
How about satellite zero f1c? I went down to the lab to see it. Okay, so welcome to the factory
We need to put on coats, but we can help you with that
And finally, I meet someone who's recognizable from all of the space exploration movies
The guy who builds the satellites is wearing a bow tie and a lab coat. His name is chester gilmore
And this is planet money satellite
This is your adopted spacecraft. So they tell me I don't know what to say. I mean, it's gorgeous
Look, it's shiny
Oh, okay
So how how do you normally describe the size of this about the size of a loaf of bread?
Or, you know, maybe a shoe box for like ballet slippers. Yes, very very nice elegant handcrafted very
capable ballet slippers
Just two dudes talking about ballet slippers. It happens. I mean technically this is a three
You that's three beanie baby boxes. It is the direct descendant of bob twig's trip to a container store
Can I pick it up?
Yes
Yes
You paused for a moment there. Well, yeah, because this is actually going to go into space
So anywhere else they would probably tell you absolutely not you can never pick up a satellite
But yes, you can pick up the satellite. I'll ask you to pick it up like this
I was just allowed to touch the edges and when I pick it up, it is super dense, you know, like picking up a baby
Okay
And if you break it you buy it joking chester says kind of
These things are pretty tough
He tells me this story about one time when they were launching a rocket with these little cube sats in it and the rocket
Blew up it blew up after launch
And satellites just like this one rained down all over the beach and we turned them on and they all worked
Chester opens up the metal casing and he shows me inside. There's lots of little gold parts
But basically it's a big camera like one of those cameras with the giant lens
You see on the sidelines of sporting events and all around the lens is the electronics
There's a little antenna to send the photos back to earth little gizmos that allow you to turn the satellite steer it a bit
Chester says you can put together the whole thing in about four hours
Amazing can go from assembly to testing to space in a matter of months
And that's the key to this whole new space business. The idea is to move fast and to innovate quickly
They basically treat satellites like you know, like iphones, right?
They release a bunch into space and then you know months later
They come up with redesigns and updates and they launch some more and then some more and then some more the satellites go up quick
And then after a few years after a few years they start to burn up
Yeah
Chester says one day you'll be looking at a photo from a satellite and you'll notice that the images of the earth are getting
Closer and closer and closer. So the first thing that happens is our imagery gets better because we're closer
It's a good news bad news. It's a good news bad news situation
Yeah, it's like you're talking to it the whole time. It's going you can be talking to it the whole time
it's going down and the earth gets closer and closer the images get better and better and then
Doesn't actually make that noise
No, but we all make the noise quietly quietly is there like and then we raise a glass
The death of a satellite is treated as a kind of celebration because it allows planet to replace that satellite
With a better one with more features even if we manage to get little zero f1c the planet money satellite into space
It is not going to have long to live
So we have to make the most of its short beautiful life
And chester lets me in on a little secret making a satellite is pretty straightforward
Figuring out how to get it into space and what to do with it. Once it's there
That part is more complicated
Next time on planet money. What can you do with a brand new satellite?
What are all these new companies with billions of dollars worth of tiny spacecraft even doing in the sky above our heads?
What will be the mission for zero f1c?

Any thoughts on what planet money's little zero f1c satellite should do send us an email planet money at npr.org
You can also find us on twitter or facebook and i'll be posting some behind the scenes photos of our satellite adventure on my instagram
I'm at radiosmith and stacy. I should warn our listeners that
My original dream became a reality a beautiful reality lay your eyes on the planet money space mission
Patch. Oh my gosh, that is a really sharp looking patch. You've got the squirrel holding a little microphone and our satellite
There's zero f1c and a little astronaut. Of course our logo is on there
We'll tell you how to get one
in a later episode
Today's episode and this entire series was produced by elizabeth coulas with an assist from nick fountain
Alex goldmark is our supervising producer brian urstadt edits the show special
Thanks today to our friends at auburn university jam worse inger and michael fogel
Also, thanks to michael stone cipher matt craft rachel holm
And trevor hammond who helps set things up with planet. I'm stacy vanek smith and i'm robert smith
Thanks for listening
We have to figure out what we're going to write on the side of our satellite
Oh
Okay, so we can draw something we can put the name of the craft sky's the limit sky's the limit anything at all
I thought you were saying that's the title
It's not a terrible title sky's the limit. Yeah, but we should ask people on the team. We should ask everyone
Oh some sort of some sort of phrase some sort of inspiring phrase like to the stars
Per ardua ad astra
Through difficulty to the stars
What is this? It's a latin phrase per ardua ad astra through difficulty to the stars
Where'd you get this from? It's the state motto of kansas, but it's also my personal motto for many years now
I know I know so write that in there. Okay. I was just coming up with names. Oh, yeah
The starship free enterprise
Good
That's a good one
Maybe productivity rising productivity rising globalization and beyond
It literally goes around the earth every 90 minutes and beyond and beyond
um capital flight
Oh capital flight's not bad
um
No such thing as a free launch free launch is not bad small set big data
I mean small set big data
I like how you translated that
PM3 cpo
I will burn up
I like that. Yeah, you know, maybe instead of i'll burn up. Maybe it's money to burn money to burn
Nice
Okay money to burn and then i'm gonna write money to burn on it. Okay
So stacy, this is what i'm afraid of which is we came up with like a bunch of good
Jokey names
But do we really want to say them for like four episodes? Right puns they can lose steam quickly
You would know yeah, I would so i'm thinking we should go with something simple something classic, okay
I want to lay this on you
pod one
I like it pod one. It's got a lot of potential
I think you just I'm sorry you came to the wrong person. I think you ruined it. I did not
I did not
