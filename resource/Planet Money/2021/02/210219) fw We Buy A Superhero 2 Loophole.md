Marvel was not interested in selling us Doorman. But there is another way to jumpstart our superhero empire. | Find the full Planet Money Superhero series here.



Planet Money ventures to another realm on their journey to acquire a superhero
Siena Mae/NPR

Well, this is awkward. In the first episode of this series, we said we would buy a superhero. We failed. Marvel has not shown any interest in our offer. Superheroes never go on the market. We worried it might be time to hang up the ol' cape and tights before we even had a chance to fly.

But there is still a way. A way to find the superhero we need to build our comic book empire. We must venture into another realm, one where thousands of superheroes are suspended in time and space. That realm: the Public Domain. With enough time — and a little luck — we will find the face of Planet Money Studios.

Miss any of the Micro-Face madness? Listen to the whole series here.

Music: "Last Man Standing," "A Hero Rises," "Heroes Legacy," and "Dream the Dream."

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCASTS)

NICK FOUNTAIN, BYLINE: Christmas tree here.

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: Make a T-shirt and then follow that shirt around the world as it gets made.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, BYLINE: We were Toxie's last owners. She was our pet toxic asset.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

A hundred barrels of crude oil.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Yes, we did.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Three, two, one. We have ignition.

SMITH: Oh, whoa.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, my gosh.

SMITH: This is PLANET MONEY Studios from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

AMANDA ARONCZYK, BYLINE: PLANET MONEY Buys A Superhero - Issue No. 2. It starts, as do all great sequels, with a highly edited recap.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

Suitcase full of money.

SMITH: Check.

MALONE: Let them know that we want to buy a superhero.

SMITH: Yep.

MALONE: Doorman.

SMITH: Doorman?

(SOUNDBITE OF COMIC SOUND EFFECTS)

MALONE: Open the door, man.

ALEX SEGURA: I'm confident in my no.

JENNIFER JENKINS: There's a loophole.

ROBERT SMITH AND KENNY MALONE: A loophole?

ARONCZYK: But to find that loophole, the PLANET MONEY team would need a guide - someone who had traveled to another dimension, found their own superhero and lived to tell about it, someone who was having an abnormally loud microphone problem.

GENE LUEN YANG: Yeah. Does the sound - does it still sound too loud?

SMITH: You know, what if you just went back a little bit from your microphone?

YANG: Should I point it away from me? Is that helpful?

SMITH: Oh, wait; what kind of microphone do you have?

ARONCZYK: This is Gene Luen Yang, a comic book artist who had worked for Marvel and DC. He was about to explain to our PLANET MONEY hosts how he found himself longing for a character outside the grasp of the giant companies, a superhero to call his own.

SMITH: This is sounding better.

MALONE: It's good.

OK, Gene, I have a copy of this comic book of yours of this 1940s superhero that you found. It's amazing. But why don't you start by just telling Robert and me how you found this superhero in the first place?

YANG: So years ago, a friend of mine forwarded me this post from a website called Pappy's Golden Age Blogzine, where they highlight these really obscure characters from the golden age of content. And this one particular post was about the Green Turtle, who on the surface is not an awesome character. He's like a Batman rip-off. So he lives in a turtle cave.

SMITH: (Laughter) No way. No way.

YANG: You know, he flies a turtle plane. He wears a turtle-themed costume. He's just not an awesome character. And worse than Batman, he doesn't wear a shirt. Like, he fights crime shirtless, right? He just - he looks really, really goofy.

SMITH: I feel like most people would've just dismissed the shirtless crusader. But there is something else. There is this rumor about the Green Turtle.

MALONE: The Green Turtle was created by an artist named Chu Hing. And the story goes that Chu Hing wanted to draw the Green Turtle as a Chinese American superhero. It would've been groundbreaking. This was the 1940s. Virtually every superhero was white.

SMITH: But this was the 1940s. The comic book company said no way.

YANG: So Chu Hing - I mean, he just - he reacts a way a comic book artist would react when they hit, like, a road bump. He just gets super passive-aggressive. So he draws these early Green Turtle comics so that you never - you almost never see his face. There's, like, a shadow over his face or there's a piece of furniture blocking his face. Something is getting in the way of you looking at his face. And the rumor is that Chu Hing did this so that both he and his reader could imagine this character as a Chinese American, as he originally intended.

MALONE: Gene became obsessed with the Green Turtle. The character had only appeared in five issues of Blazing Comics back in 1944, not long enough to get a proper backstory or resolution. And Gene thought to himself, I could revive this character. I could fill out that story. I could make it clear once and for all that this was a Chinese American superhero.

SMITH: The question, of course, was who even owns this character in the first place? More importantly, who's going to show up to sue me? Gene starts to talk to lawyers, searches old copyright records from the Library of Congress.

YANG: It's all the stuff that, like, comic book artists are not good at. We're not good at money. We're not good at legal stuff. Like, most of the time I'm thinking about, you know, what is the next, like, genetic mutated monster that Lex Luthor is going to launch at Superman.

SMITH: But what Gene learned was that the Green Turtle lived in a strange dimension of the legal universe. The copyright had lapsed. No one owned the Green Turtle anymore, which meant that Gene had as much right as anyone else to redraw him because the Green Turtle had entered into the public domain.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Our quest for a PLANET MONEY superhero continues. We had the front door - man - slammed in our face, man. But Gene Luen Yang has found a loophole we can squeeze through.

MALONE: Today on the show, we travel through the cracks in time and space and copyright law to find a character like the Green Turtle that even the Marvel empire has left behind.

SMITH: And what we find is a lost superhero that feels like it was made just for us, for PLANET MONEY, from 80 years ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Why don't we start by just checking out this weird afterlife of intellectual property known as the public domain?

SMITH: The public domain.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: We've talked about this strange land on PLANET MONEY before, about how entire books can fall into the public domain - or songs.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU")

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) Happy birthday to you.

MALONE: Hey, I guess we're allowed to play that song now.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU")

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) Happy birthday to you.

SMITH: This is where creative works go when their copyright expires. And just like books and songs, it can happen to characters, too.

MALONE: Look, Robert; it's Jay Gatsby talking to Lady Macbeth.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As Lady Macbeth) Out. Out, damned spot.

SMITH: And there - there's who Gene was looking for. The Green Turtle, what's up?

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As Green Turtle) Hey, guys.

SMITH: Gene says hi, wants to use you in a comic.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As Green Turtle) Nice.

SMITH: To pluck an old vintage character like the Green Turtle from the public domain solves quite a few problems for our superhero quest. Despite all of you, our listeners, tweeting all week at Marvel to #openthedoorman, we have not heard back from Marvel, and we never will. We have to move on, Kenny. We got to move on.

MALONE: Many of you suggested that we could move on by maybe drawing our own - how should we say? - homage to the Doorman, Sliding Doorman...

SMITH: Sure.

MALONE: ...Pet Doorman, perhaps.

SMITH: Or the very well-dressed Christian Diorman.

MALONE: But it's just not the same to make up a new superhero. Superheroes are our modern Greek or Roman gods, like, featured in these stories about right and wrong. They get passed down to us from before we were born. It's the patina and the provenance of a superhero that make it feel real. So we're not just going to draw one, make one up.

SMITH: OK. But if old, vintage superheroes are like gold, how many Green Turtles could really be out there, superheroes that fell into the public domain? We reckon only one person has the answer.

JENKINS: My name is Jennifer Jenkins, and I am a clinical professor of law at Duke Law School. And I am also the director of the Center for the Study of the Public Domain, which just rolls off the tongue.

MALONE: It doesn't, but I'm sure you own the trademark to it, which is great. You know, who else would want that?

JENKINS: You know what? We didn't. We thought that might be a little bit strange if we're the Public Domain Center and we're getting claim rights to the trademark.

MALONE: Jennifer Jenkins practices what she preaches, and she is preaching how our superhero quest is exactly why our country has the public domain.

SMITH: Every great work of art will eventually end up in the public domain. And although we called this show Loophole and we've talked about a loophole, it's not really a loophole. This is not an accident. The copyright system was designed this way to stimulate creativity.

JENKINS: How does it do that? Well, during the copyright term, it gives you exclusive rights. It gives you control. That incentivizes you to create things and put them out there. But after the term ends, it ensures that all that creative raw material is available for future creators, and that stimulates creativity as well. And hopefully it will be stimulating your creativity.

SMITH: And Jennifer says that with this superhero project, we kind of lucked out because of this magical moment in superhero history, the 1940s.

MALONE: In the 1940s, there were two critical things happening in the world of comic books. No. 1 - there was a superhero explosion known as the golden age of comics. We talked about this in Episode 1. Hundreds, thousands of superheroes were being created, and most of them did not take off like Superman or Batman.

SMITH: Which helps us because of reason No. 2. The '40s was part of this special era in copyright history. The lifespan of a normal copyright at that time was relatively short, at least compared to today. It was just 28 years. And then whoever owned the copyright that they took out in the 1940s had to actively file the paperwork to renew it in the 1970s. And, you know, with all the disco and the hot tubs and the cocaine, some small companies understandably spaced out on the need to renew their superheroes.

MALONE: Or more likely, in the 1970s, like, these weird, old, golden age superheroes were not exactly doing gangbusters. So unless you had seen success like Marvel or DC, there may not have been a great business reason to spend money renewing some failed character from your olden days.

JENKINS: Guess what. The commercial lifespan of most creative works, sadly, is not that long. So, you know, the brilliant song that you've been working on, the great thing that I've been writing - it's never going to sell anyway. But even if it does, it might not be selling after 28 years. After 28 years, 85% of works were not renewed, suggesting that the copyright owners did not find it worthwhile.

SMITH: What this means is that the Green Turtle isn't that rare after all. There are plenty of golden age superheroes whose copyrights weren't renewed after 28 years and are now in the public domain. These superheroes are fair game, ready for anyone to pull them out of obscurity.

MALONE: And this is exactly what we need to do to get a real, authentic vintage PLANET MONEY superhero. We need to go dumpster diving through the annals of comic book history.

SMITH: And Jennifer says we don't even have to look that hard.

JENKINS: All of these fans of these old comic books and these old superheroes have actually done the legwork of exhuming, finding, digging up characters and saying, hey, here's our favorite list of public domain comic book characters. I would probably start there.

SMITH: And to help us, Jennifer sent us some of the lists these fans had pulled together.

MALONE: So this is one of the websites you sent me, Jennifer. I just want to say there are 3,368 characters collected on this website that Jennifer sent.

JENKINS: I'm not vouching for this. This is just the first thing that came up on Google.

MALONE: Fair enough.

SMITH: Now, all we have to do is narrow it down just a bit from 3,368 choices.

MALONE: It's a lot. But, look; Gene Luen Yang was able to do this...

YANG: I remember going to sleep thinking about the Green Turtle, wanting to fill out his origin story.

MALONE: ...And succeed - like, he wrote the Green Turtle a brand-new origin story. And in this new version, there was no question this was a Chinese American superhero.

SMITH: Also no question - the Green Turtle's still shirtless - very hunky muscles.

MALONE: That's right. And in 2014, he was able to legally publish this new story in a graphic novel called "The Shadow Hero," drawn by Sonny Liew.

YANG: I did the writing, and Sonny, an amazing artist, did all of the illustrations.

MALONE: It's very good. The illustrations are very good.

YANG: He's so good, right?

MALONE: It gives me hope, Robert, that the PLANET MONEY superhero is out there somewhere just waiting to be discovered like the Green Turtle. And Gene - he gave us some advice on finding the perfect superhero for us in a list of thousands.

YANG: I think it's kind of like falling in love, right? Like, how do you know when you fall in love? I do think you don't go for the cool. I really do think that cool gets in the way of that heart connection that you might have with one of these characters. I really think it's that combination of goofiness and idealism. You want a goofy expression of an ideal.

MALONE: That's good. I mean, that is succinct and boiled down. I mean, like...

SMITH: That's great.

MALONE: ...That's a thing we can go hunting for right now - or go hunting for after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: All right, I'm going to pull up this list of 3,000 characters allegedly in the public domain.

SMITH: All right. Somewhere in here is our PLANET MONEY superhero.

MALONE: It's in alphabetical order.

SMITH: OK.

MALONE: Ace of Blades.

SMITH: I don't like it.

MALONE: I got Airboy.

SMITH: Airboy sounds like a brand of mattress.

MALONE: OK. Arson Fiend.

SMITH: (Laughter) Arson Fiend? OK. Oh, man.

MALONE: Yeah, OK. This is going to take forever. Blargo the Lawless.

SMITH: No.

MALONE: Blooperman.

SMITH: No.

MALONE: Captain 3D.

SMITH: I thought we're all 3D.

MALONE: Horned Hood. Electric Ray.

SMITH: Next.

MALONE: Electro Man. Impossible Man. Express Man.

SMITH: They all sound so bad.

MALONE: Lava Man.

SMITH: Ooh, Futuro.

MALONE: No.

SMITH: Futuro.

MALONE: No. Lava Man, right.

SMITH: (Unintelligible) Man.

MALONE: No.

SMITH: Menthor.

MALONE: What are we doing?

SMITH: (Singing) Kid Eternity.

MALONE: No. Kangaroo Man - no. Like, no, right? No.

SMITH: No way.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: This is like going through Tinder for superheroes. It's like swipe left, left, left, weird costume, terrible superpowers, shirtless, left, left.

MALONE: So, OK, let's just keep going. Let me throw this one past you. This one, Robert, I have high hopes for. Let me just - I'm just going to share him with you on my screen.

SMITH: All right. There's a guy. It looks like he has sort of a hood and two little...

MALONE: Yes.

SMITH: ...Things over his eyes and, like...

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: ...Something on his face. It's sort of - he's got, like, a weird evil executioner vibe.

MALONE: He looks a little scary. I will give you that. He's a good guy, though. He's not an executioner. The mask he's wearing is his superpower. And just listen to what this thing does, Robert. OK, No. 1 - those weird things on his eyes, those are photoelectric eyes. He can see through things.

SMITH: OK. Yeah.

MALONE: OK. The little bumps on his ears that you see there - super hearing. He can, like, hear things from far away.

SMITH: All right.

MALONE: Great, right?

SMITH: Yeah.

MALONE: OK. And then the thing over most of his face - mouth, nose - that is a giant microphone.

SMITH: Oh.

MALONE: The superpower is a giant microphone face mask.

SMITH: So his, like, voice is really loud.

MALONE: He can make his voice really loud. He can, like, throw his voice like a ventriloquist. He can disguise his voice. He can make himself sound like other people. He can, like, generate, like, surround sound and, like, freak out criminals and, like, chaos can ensue.

SMITH: (Laughter) He's got the power of audio processing...

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: ...In his face.

MALONE: Yes. He is functionally like a little one-man broadcaster. Like, that is his superpower.

SMITH: It's unique.

MALONE: It's unique. It's unique, right?

SMITH: It's unique.

MALONE: And here - I want you to open this other link.

SMITH: OK.

MALONE: He's not in very many comic book appearances, but the ones he's in are all online - you know, public domain and all. And I just want you to take a look at this panel here. And we can get a sense of how his, like, supersonic hearing works.

SMITH: OK. In this panel, he's in an alleyway. He's looking for a bad guy. And there's the sound of footsteps way off in the distance.

(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)

SMITH: And then he says...

MALONE: (As Micro-Face) My micro-hearing brings the sound of running feet. It is Eddie Torpedo (ph). There he is ahead.

SMITH: This is very useful. I myself have spent much of my career recording footsteps and then boosting up the volume level in the mix.

MALONE: Who among us, Robert? Who among us? Later in the comic, though, we finally get to see the big gun - or rather, I should say, the big microphone.

SMITH: On his face.

MALONE: Yeah. We get to see what his face mic can do.

SMITH: There's this gang of gun-toting goons, and we hear our hero say...

(As Micro-Face) I'll throw real fear into these punks.

MALONE: Then he uses his face microphone to broadcast the sound of a police whistle.

(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)

MALONE: But it's not just a loud whistle. He can make it like surround sound, so these bad guys now think they're surrounded by cops.

(SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)

SMITH: The goons lose it.

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As goon) Cop whistles? There's a whole squad.

MALONE: Chaos ensues. Our hero prevails. And, Robert, I love him. I love him so much. He listens. He then edits audio. He confuses people with his microphone.

SMITH: He is a podcaster. He's literally a podcast superhero...

MALONE: (Laughter) Yes.

SMITH: ...From 1943.

MALONE: This is the PLANET MONEY superhero. We can, like, re-imagine his backstory. We can update the creepy mask. We can give him cool audio powers.

SMITH: We can write a new comic book. We can do a T-shirt or, you know, action figures, a USB microphone face mask so you can podcast with his mask.

MALONE: The possibilities are endless.

SMITH: And now, all we have to do is introduce him to the world - amplified, of course, maybe a little bit of reverb, little compression on there. And he steps out in front of the PLANET MONEY audience, and he says...

MALONE: (As Micro-Face) I am Micro-Face.

SMITH: That's Micro-hyphen-Face.

MALONE: His face is totally normal-sized, just to be clear.

SMITH: But that's his name, Micro-Face. It's just a microphone on the face.

MALONE: Face, yeah.

SMITH: You get it.

MALONE: You get it.

SMITH: Yeah.

MALONE: OK.

(As Micro-Face) I am Micro-Face.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARONCZYK: And so, until he is needed, the PLANET MONEY superhero waits quietly. Wherever there is evil, he hears it. Whenever there is a call for justice, he amplifies it. Across all spectrums, the microphone broadcasts a message of hope. Never fear, for Micro-Face is here.

SMITH: Next time on PLANET MONEY Buys A Superhero, we assemble a team - a team of the world's best comic book writers, artists, letterers - the people who do the little letters in the bubbles - and we turn them loose on Micro-Face.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I mean, I have experience with some pretty - you know, no offense, but pretty dumb golden age heroes.

MALONE: (Laughter).

That's next Friday - same micro-time, same micro-place. Just to be clear, it's a normal-sized time and place.

SMITH: Yeah, it's just a microphone.

MALONE: Microphone.

SMITH: We're going to use a microphone.

MALONE: Yeah, that's right.

If you would like to support PLANET MONEY, you could check out our PLANET MONEY animal spirits T-shirt. It is back in the NPR store. That is shop.npr.org/planetmoney. And I will just say, maybe keep an eye on that shop over the next couple weeks - just keep an eye.

SMITH: Something's coming.

MALONE: You can catch us on all the social media - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok. We are @planetmoney.

SMITH: If you want more strange tales from that other dimension known as the public domain, Jennifer Jenkins has co-written two comic books, "Tales From The Public Domain." They are both, of course, free online.

This episode was produced by James Sneed with help from Maria Paz Gutierrez, engineering help from Gilly Moon. The show is edited by Liza Yeager. Bryant Urstadt edits the whole show, PLANET MONEY. Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer.

MALONE: I'm Micro-Face.

SMITH: No, I'm Micro-Face. Wait a minute; we're all Micro-Face because this is NPR. Thanks for listening.

MALONE: Listening.

SMITH: Listening.

MALONE: Listening. I think we have our catchphrase.

SMITH: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: His catchphrase is thanks for listening. His second catchphrase is support your local NPR station.

Oh my gosh.
This is Planet Money Studios from NPR.
Planet Money buys a superhero, issue number two.
It starts, as do all great sequels,
with a highly edited recap.
Suitcase full of money.
Check.
Let them know that we want to buy a superhero.
Yep.
Door man.
Door man?
Open the door, man!
I'm confident in my know.
There's a loophole.
A loophole?
But to find that loophole,
the Planet Money team would need a guide.
Someone who had traveled to another dimension,
found their own superhero,
and lived to tell about it.
Someone who was having
an abnormally loud microphone problem.
Yeah, does it sound, does it still sound too loud?
You know, what if you just went back
a little bit from your microphone?
Should I point it away from me?
Is that helpful?
Oh wait, what kind of microphone do you have?
This is Gene Luen Yang,
a comic book artist who had worked for Marvel and DC.
He was about to explain to our Planet Money hosts
how he found himself longing for a character
outside the grasp of the giant companies.
A superhero to call his own.
This is sounding better.
That's good.
Okay, Gene, I have a copy of this comic book of yours,
of this 1940s superhero that you found.
It's amazing, but why don't you start
by just telling Robert and me
how you found this superhero in the first place?
So years ago, a friend of mine forwarded me this post
from a website called Pappy's Golden Age Blogzine,
where they highlight these really obscure characters
from the Golden Age of comics.
And this one particular post was about the Green Turtle,
who on the surface is not an awesome character.
He's like a Batman ripoff.
So he lives in a turtle cave.
You know, he flies a turtle plane.
He wears a turtle themed costume.
He's just not an awesome character.
And worse than Batman, he doesn't wear a shirt.
Like he fights crime shirtless, right?
He looks really, really goofy.
I feel like most people would have just dismissed
the shirtless crusader, but there is something else.
There is this rumor about the Green Turtle.
The Green Turtle was created
by an artist named Chu Hing.
And the story goes that Chu Hing wanted to draw
the Green Turtle as a Chinese American superhero.
It would have been groundbreaking.
This was the 1940s.
Virtually every superhero was white.
But this was the 1940s.
The comic book company said, no way.
So Chu Hing, I mean, he just,
he reacts the way a comic book artist would react
when they hit like a road bump.
He just gets super passive aggressive.
So he draws these early Green Turtle comics
so that you almost never see his face.
There's like a shadow over his face
or there's a piece of furniture blocking his face.
Something is getting in the way
of you looking at his face.
And the rumor is that Chu Hing did this
so that both he and his reader
could imagine this character as a Chinese American
as he originally intended.
Gene became obsessed with the Green Turtle.
The character had only appeared in five issues
of Blazing Comics back in 1944.
Not long enough to get a proper backstory or a resolution.
And Gene thought to himself,
I could revive this character.
I could fill out that story.
I could make it clear once and for all
that this was a Chinese American superhero.
The question of course was,
who even owns this character in the first place?
More importantly, who's gonna show up to sue me?
Gene starts to talk to lawyers,
searches old copyright records
from the Library of Congress.
It's all the stuff that like comic book artists
are not good at.
We're not good at money.
We're not good at legal stuff.
Like most of the time I'm thinking about, you know,
what is the next like genetic mutated monster
that Lex Luthor is gonna launch at Superman?
But what Gene learned was that the Green Turtle
lived in a strange dimension of the legal universe.
The copyright had lapsed.
No one owned the Green Turtle anymore.
Which meant that Gene had as much right
as anyone else to redraw him.
Because the Green Turtle had entered
into the public domain.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Kenny Malone.
And I'm Robert Smith.
Our quest for a Planet Money superhero continues.
We had the front door, man, slammed in our face, man.
But Gene Luen Yang has found a loophole
we can squeeze through.
Today on the show,
we travel through the cracks in time and space
and copyright law to find a character
like the Green Turtle
that even the Marvel Empire has left behind.
And what we find is a lost superhero
that feels like it was made just for us,
for Planet Money from 80 years ago.

The public domain.
We've talked about this strange land

about how entire books can fall into the public domain,

Happy birthday to you.

Happy birthday to you.

it can happen to characters too.
Look Robert, it's Jay Gatsby talking to Lady Macbeth.
Out of damn spot.
And there, there's who Gene was looking for.
The green turtle, what's up?
Hey guys.
Gene says hi, wants to see you in a comic.
Nice.
To pluck an old vintage character
like the green turtle from the public domain
solves quite a few problems for our superhero quest.
Despite all of you, our listeners,
tweeting all week at Marvel to hashtag open the door man,
we have not heard back from Marvel and we never will.
We have to move on Kenny, we gotta move on.
Many of you suggested that we could move on
by maybe drawing our own, how should we say,
homage to the door man, sliding door man,
pet door man perhaps.
Or the very well dressed Christian Dior man.
But it's just not the same to make up a new superhero.
Superheroes are our modern Greek or Roman gods
like featured in these stories about right and wrong
that get passed down to us from before we were born.
It's the patina and the provenance of a superhero
that make it feel real.
So we're not just gonna draw one, make one up.
Okay, but if old vintage superheroes are like gold,
how many green turtles could really be out there?
Superheroes that fell into the public domain.
We reckon only one person has the answer.
My name is Jennifer Jenkins
and I am a clinical professor of law at Duke Law School.
And I am also the director of the Center for the Study
of the Public Domain, which just rolls off the tongue.
It doesn't, but I'm sure you own the trademark to it,
which is great.
Who else would want that?
You know what, we didn't,
we thought that might be a little bit strange
if we're the public domain center
where we're gonna go claim rights to the trademark.
Jennifer Jenkins practices what she preaches
and she is preaching how our superhero quest
is exactly why our country has the public domain.
Every great work of art will eventually end up
in the public domain.
And although we called this show loophole
and we've talked about a loophole,
it's not really a loophole.
This is not an accident.
The copyright system was designed this way
to stimulate creativity.
How does it do that?
Well, during the copyright term,
it gives you exclusive rights.
It gives you control that incentivize you
to create things and put them out there.
But after the term ends,
it ensures that all that creative raw material
is available for future creators
and that stimulates creativity as well.
And hopefully it will be stimulating your creativity.
And Jennifer says that with this superhero project,
we kind of lucked out
because of this magical moment in superhero history,
the 1940s.
In the 1940s, there were two critical things happening
in the world of comic books.
Number one, there was a superhero explosion
known as the golden age of comics.
We talked about this in episode one.
Hundreds, thousands of superheroes were being created
and most of them did not take off
like Superman or Batman.
Which helps us because of reason number two.
The 40s was part of this special era
in copyright history.
The lifespan of a normal copyright at that time
was relatively short, at least compared to today.
It was just 28 years.
And then whoever owned the copyright
that they took out in the 1940s
had to actively file the paperwork to renew it
in the 1970s.
And you know, with all the disco and the hot tubs
and the cocaine, some small companies
understandably spaced out
on the need to renew their superheroes.
Or more likely in the 1970s,
like these weird old golden age superheroes
were not exactly doing gangbusters.
So unless you had seen success like Marvel or DC,
there may not have been a great business reason
to spend money renewing some failed character
from your olden days.
Guess what?
The commercial lifespan of most creative works,
sadly is not that long.
So the brilliant song that you've been working on,
the great thing that I've been writing,
it's never gonna sell anyway.
But even if it does,
it might not be selling after 28 years.
After 28 years, 85% of works were not renewed,
suggesting that the copyright owners
did not find it worthwhile.
What this means is that the green turtle
isn't that rare after all.
There are plenty of golden age superheroes
whose copyrights weren't renewed after 28 years
and are now in the public domain.
These superheroes are fair game
ready for anyone to pull them out of obscurity.
And this is exactly what we need to do
to get a real authentic vintage Planet Money superhero.
We need to go dumpster diving
through the annals of comic book history.
And Jennifer says we don't even have to look that hard.
All of these fans of these old comic books
and these old superheroes have actually done the legwork
of exhuming, finding, digging up characters
and saying, hey, here's our favorite list
of public domain comic book characters.
I would probably start there.
And to help us, Jennifer sent us some of the lists
these fans had pulled together.
So this is one of the websites you sent me, Jennifer.
I just wanna say there are 3,368 characters
collected on this website that Jennifer sent.
I'm not vouching for this.
It's just the first thing that came up on Google.
Fair enough.
Now all we have to do is narrow it down just a bit
from 3,368 choices.
It's a lot, but look,
Gene Luen Yang was able to do this.
I remember going to sleep thinking about the green turtle
wanting to fill out his origin story.
And succeed, like he wrote the green turtle
a brand new origin story.
And in this new version, there was no question.
This was a Chinese-American superhero.
Also no question, the green turtle is still shirtless.
Very hunky muscles.
That's right.
And in 2014, he was able to legally publish
this new story in a graphic novel
called The Shadow Hero, drawn by Sunny Lu.
I did the writing and Sunny,
an amazing artist, did all of the illustrations.
It's very good.
The illustrations are very good.
He's so good, right?
It gives me hope, Robert,
that the Planet Money superhero is out there somewhere,
just waiting to be discovered like the green turtle.
And Gene, he gave us some advice
on finding the perfect superhero for us
in a list of thousands.
I think it's kind of like falling in love, right?
Like, how do you know when you fall in love?
I do think you don't go for the cool.
I really do think that cool gets in the way
of that heart connection that you might have
with one of these characters.
I really think it's that combination
of goofiness and idealism.
You want a goofy expression of an ideal.
That's good.
I mean, that is succinct and boiled down.
I mean, like, that's a thing we can go hunting for
right now, or go hunting for after the break.
All right, I'm gonna pull up this list
of 3,000 characters, allegedly in the public domain.
All right, it's somewhere in here
is our Planet Money superhero.
In alphabetical order.
Okay.
Ace of Blades.
I don't like it.
I got Air Boy.
Air Boy sounds like a brand of mattress.
Okay, Arson Fiend.
Arson Fiend?
Okay.
Oh, man.
Yeah, okay, this is gonna take forever.
Blargo the Lawless.
No.
Blooper Man.
No.
Captain 3D.
I thought we were all 3D.
Horned Hood.
Electric Ray.
Next.
Electro Man.
Express Man.
They all sound so bad.
Lava Man.
Ooh, Futuro.
No.
Futuro.
No.
Lava Man.
Right.
Croco Man.
No.
Menthor.
What are we doing?
Kid Eternity.
No.
Kangaroo Man.
No, like no, right?
No.
No way.
This is like going through Tinder for superheroes.
It's like swipe left, left, left, weird costume,
terrible superpowers, shirtless, left, left.
So, okay, let's just keep going.
Let me throw this one past you.
This one, Robert, I have high hopes for.
Let me just, I'm just gonna share him with you
on my screen.
All right, there's a guy,
it looks like he has sort of a hood
and two little things over his eyes
and like something on his face.
It's sort of, he's got like a weird evil executioner vibe.
He looks a little scary.
I will give you that.
He's a good guy though.
He's not an executioner.
The mask he is wearing is his superpower.
And just listen to what this thing does, Robert.
Okay, number one, those weird things on his eyes,
those are photoelectric eyes.
He can see through things.
Yeah.
Okay, the little bumps on his ears
that you see there, super hearing.
He can like hear things from far away.
All right.
Right, right, okay.
And then the thing over most of his face,
mouth, nose, that is a giant microphone.
Oh.
The superpower is a giant microphone face mask.
So he's like, voice is really loud?
He can make his voice really loud.
He can like throw his voice like a ventriloquist.
He can disguise his voice.
He can make himself sound like other people.
He can like generate like surround sound
and like freak out criminals and like chaos can ensue.
He's got the power of audio processing in his face.
Yes, he is functionally like a little one man broadcaster.
Like that is his superpower.
It's unique.
It's unique, it's unique, right?
It's unique.
And here, I want you to open this other link.
Okay.
He's not in very many comic book appearances,
but the ones he's in are all online,
you know, public domain and all.
And I just want you to take a look at this panel here
and we can get a sense of how his
like supersonic hearing works.
Okay.
In this panel, he's in an alleyway.
He's looking for a bad guy.
And there's the sound of footsteps
way off in the distance.
And then he says.
My micro hearing brings the sound of running feet.
It is Eddie Torpedo.
There he is ahead.
This is very useful.
I myself have spent much of my career
recording footsteps and then boosting up
the volume level in the mix.
Who among us, Robert?
Who among us?
Later in the comic though,
we finally get to see the big gun
or rather I should say the big microphone.
On his face.
Yeah, we get to see what his face mic can do.
There's this gang of gun toting goons
and we hear our hero say.
I'll throw real fear into these punks.
Then he uses his face microphone
to broadcast the sound of a police whistle.
But it's not just a loud whistle.
He can make it like surround sound
so these bad guys now think they're surrounded by cops.
The goons lose it.
Cop whistles.
There's a whole squad.
Chaos ensues.
Our hero prevails.
And Robert,
I love him.
I love him so much.
He listens.
He then edits audio.
He confuses people with his microphone.
He is a podcaster.
He's literally a podcast superhero
from 1943.
This is the Planet Money superhero.
We can like reimagine his backstory.
We can update the creepy mask.
We can give him cool audio powers.
We can write a new comic book.
We can do a T-shirt or action figures.
A USB microphone face mask
so you can podcast with his mask.
The possibilities are endless.
And now all we have to do
is introduce him to the world.
Amplified, of course,
maybe a little bit of reverb,
a little compression on there.
And he steps out
in front of the Planet Money audience and he says,
I am
micro face.
That's micro hyphen face.
His face is totally normal sized, just to be clear.
But that's his name, micro face.
It's just a microphone on the face.
You get it.
I am micro face.
And so until he is needed,
the Planet Money superhero waits quietly.
Wherever there is evil, he hears it.
Whenever there is a call for justice,
he amplifies it.
Across all spectrums,
the microphone broadcasts a message of hope.
Never fear.
For micro face is here.
Next time on Planet Money Buys a Superhero,
we assemble a team,
a team of the world's best comic book writers,
artists, letters,
the people who do the little letters in the bubbles.
And we turn them loose on micro face.
I mean, I have experience with some pretty,
you know, no offense,
but pretty dumb golden age heroes.
That's next Friday.
Same micro time, same micro place.
Just to be clear,
it's a normal size time and place.
Yeah, it's just a microphone.
Microphone.
We're gonna use a microphone.
