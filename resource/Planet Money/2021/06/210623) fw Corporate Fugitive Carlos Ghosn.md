Japan once served sushi in the shape of Carlos Ghosn's face. Then Japanese authorities arrested the celebrity CEO who remade Nissan. We bring you first hand accounts of his spectacular rise, sudden fall and dramatic escape. | This episode is a collaboration with HBR IdeaCast.

In 2018, Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Japan. He was the CEO of two car companies: Nissan in Japan and Renault in France. Ghosn was also drawing two salaries — and executives at Nissan said he had failed to disclose his earnings, violating Japanese law.

Before Ghosn's trial begins, he makes his escape. Hiding in a music equipment box, he bypasses security and is flown on a private jet to Lebanon, a country with no extradition policy with Japan. In this episode, we follow the incredible rise and fall of Carlos Ghosn, and hear from the fugitive himself.

There is way more to this story — race car driving executives, a boardroom coup, and a spy scandal — listen to the four-part series "The Rise and Fall of Carlos Ghosn" from HBR IdeaCast here.

Reporting from this episode is drawn from the new book, "Collision Course: Carlos Ghosn and the Culture Wars That Upended an Auto Empire" by Hans Greimel and William Sposato and published by Harvard Business Review Press.

Music: "Cover Up," "The Missing Link," and "Strip Parade."

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:

On November 18, 2018, Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Japan. Ghosn was the CEO of not one, but two global automakers at the same time - Nissan in Japan and Renault in France.

CURT NICKISCH, HOST:

Before his trial, Ghosn was being held and interrogated in a concrete prison on the outskirts of Tokyo. This was a man who was used to jetting around the world to his palatial homes in Paris, Beirut and Rio, all paid for by Nissan. Now he got a 15-minute limit on his bathing time and a hard futon in a cell, all paid for by the Japanese government.

ARONCZYK: For a short time, journalists could visit him in prison.

YANN ROUSSEAU: So he was wearing civilian clothes in a way, some sport pants and a big sweater.

ARONCZYK: Yann Rousseau is the Tokyo correspondent for France's business newspaper Les Echos. He was one of the very few reporters to visit Ghosn while he was in prison.

ROUSSEAU: And he had some kind of flip-flop, the one you use here in Japan when you go to a public bath. Because he couldn't have his nice shoes, so he was like that. But he was still very classy. His hair was a little grayer and messier because, you know, he used to put a dark - how do you say?

NICKISCH: Dye. Dye or coloring, yeah.

ROUSSEAU: Like he was dyeing his hair black to look younger. He was still strong. He was not complaining that much.

NICKISCH: They didn't have much time together. One guard stood right by, writing down everything they said. Another guard stood in the back of the room with a stopwatch.

ROUSSEAU: Japan (ph), so it's 20 minutes sharp. It's not 19:55. It's not 20:05. It's 20 minutes sharp. So the guy was telling us, 10 minutes left, five minutes left. So Ghosn wanted to talk a lot, a lot. And I feel it felt good to let go. And for the first time, we are hearing his official defense version. That was the first time it was out there.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn would go on to share his official defense version in this video statement.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CARLOS GHOSN: The first message is I'm innocent.

NICKISCH: Innocent of allegedly underreporting his pay by millions of dollars, transferring his personal financial losses to Nissan's books, misusing company assets and funneling $5 million from a subsidiary for personal gain.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: I'm innocent of all the charges that have been brought against me, and I'm also innocent of all the accusation that came around these charges that are all biased, twisted in a way to paint a personage of greed and a personage of dictatorship.

ARONCZYK: In the video, Ghosn says that he is the real victim here, that he'd been working to merge Renault and Nissan more closely but that the executives at Nissan and the Japanese government did not want that. That is why, he alleges, they're conspiring to stop him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: Finally, what I would like to say is my big hope, my biggest wish is to have a fair trial.

ARONCZYK: A few months later, as you might remember, Ghosn decides that he's not going to get a fair trial in Japan.

NICKISCH: So before his trial begins, he leaves his Tokyo home and rendezvous with a former Green Beret and his son, a duo who specialize in getting people out of places where they don't want to be. The dad-son team has prepared a music equipment box, the kind you see roadies pushing around at a concert.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID ASHOK RAMANI AND JONATHAN ELIAS' "THE MISSING LINK")

ARONCZYK: The box has got a few holes drilled into the bottom so Ghosn can still breathe, like a firefly in a jar. He climbs into the box, and he's wheeled into the airport through a private jet terminal to bypass security. Then, this very, very expensive piece of cargo is loaded onto a jet, which takes off and flies towards Lebanon, a country that happens to have no extradition treaty with Japan.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID ASHOK RAMANI AND JONATHAN ELIAS' "THE MISSING LINK")

ARONCZYK: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk.

NICKISCH: And I'm Curt Nickisch.

ARONCZYK: Curt is the host of an excellent new four-part podcast series called "The Rise And Fall Of Carlos Ghosn." It's on the Harvard Business Review show "HBR IdeaCast." And Curt has spent months looking into one of the strangest corporate stories that I've ever heard. It's about a famous CEO - so famous there is a bento box named after him - and the famous CEO's escape from Japan - in a box, not a bento box.

NICKISCH: Today on the show, how did Carlos Ghosn go from being one of the world's most admired CEOs to a fugitive from justice?

ARONCZYK: And what happens when a flashy, Western-style CEO meets a culture used to equality and harmony at work?

NICKISCH: And, yes, we talked to Carlos Ghosn, the fugitive himself.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID ASHOK RAMANI AND JONATHAN ELIAS' "THE MISSING LINK")

ARONCZYK: A good place to start the story of what went right and what went wrong during Carlos Ghosn's time at Nissan is with the person who put him there.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

AUTOMATED VOICE MESSAGE: (Speaking French).

LOUIS SCHWEITZER: Louis Schweitzer.

AUTOMATED VOICE MESSAGE: (Speaking French).

(SOUNDBITE OF BEEP)

NICKISCH: After a few voicemails and emails, I got him on the line.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: Oh, OK, my name is Louis Schweitzer. I am now 78 years old. And I have had a varied career - civil servant, company and not-for-profit institutions.

NICKISCH: That's a modest way of putting it. Louis Schweitzer was the chief of staff for a prime minister of France before going to the French carmaker Renault.

ARONCZYK: You may remember one of their best-known models. It was called Le Car. Really, that is what it's called.

NICKISCH: To his credit, Le Schweitzer joined the company after Le Car. He became the chair and CEO in 1992. And like a responsible executive, within a few years, he was already thinking about who would succeed him.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: There were very good people within Renault, but none that I considered able to become the CEO.

ARONCZYK: Schweitzer needed a deputy. Renault was in debt, in danger of bankruptcy. Critics called Renault a bloated ward of the French state. And Schweitzer needed new blood to help him turn the company around.

NICKISCH: And he finds Carlos Ghosn - in his early 40s, born in Brazil, raised in Lebanon, educated at the top universities in France and clearly outstanding. Schweitzer knows right away he's found his guy.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: Well, he was a very impressive person with a stamina, a drive, an intensity which I found quite extraordinary. I told him immediately that if he succeeded, he would be my successor.

ARONCZYK: In 1996, Schweitzer hires Ghosn as his deputy.

NICKISCH: Over three years, Ghosn undertakes huge organizational changes, streamlining production, closing a factory and centralizing key operations.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn proves himself to be super rational, super numbers-driven and extremely good at saving the company's money. He's also kind of an oddball.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: He does not seem like a creature of the auto industry.

ARONCZYK: That is Sonari Glinton. He used to be NPR's auto industry reporter. You may have heard him on the show before. He's interviewed Ghosn a bunch of times.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

GLINTON: There are only two people in the auto industry in the decade or change that I was in it that I thought, this dude is a thinker. He's like an intellectual running a car company. That's the difference. That is what makes him different from other folks.

NICKISCH: Sonari says the auto industry is full of executives who are stereotypical car guys or engineers who make their way up the ranks. Carlos Ghosn just stood out in ways you wouldn't expect

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

GLINTON: The average height of a CEO was definitely, like, over, you know, over 5'11". He is not.

NICKISCH: Right.

GLINTON: I don't know how tall he is, but I know he is not a tall, imposing person. And he makes up for that by, like, being genuinely gregarious, interested in you, sort of hyper-focused. You know, he has these, like, really bushy eyebrows. And he's, like, just a small, intense person, like the person that kind of leans in a little much.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn's turnaround at Renault was so successful and so rapid, people started calling him Le Cost Killer.

NICKISCH: And this was at a time of consolidation in the auto industry. Making cars is expensive, and big companies were teaming up to try to save money and reach more buyers. In 1998, there was this blockbuster deal, the so-called merger of equals between Mercedes-Benz in Germany and Chrysler in the U.S.

ARONCZYK: And for someone as ambitious as Ghosn, as Louis Schweitzer puts it, Renault started to feel...

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: Too small, too French, too alone.

ARONCZYK: So the small, French and alone Renault starts looking around for its own corporate dance partner. As it happens, one of Japan's biggest carmakers, Nissan, was in dire straits.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: Nissan was losing heaps of money, so they needed somebody to cut their costs massively.

ARONCZYK: Schweitzer's like, I have just le guy for you, Le Cost Killer himself, Carlos Ghosn. So Renault will use some of the pile of money they just saved in their own turnaround to help retool Nissan. They'll spend $5 billion to buy up more than a third of the company. And they frame the whole deal as an alliance, not a merger.

NICKISCH: I don't know. Can we just stop and comment on how unlikely this all was? Nissan was exporting millions of cars around the world. Renault was tiny in comparison. And sending a senior executive from France to go to Japan to help them do a better job of making cars, that's like sending somebody to France to tell them how to make baguettes.

ARONCZYK: Also, Japan had very few foreign executives, and it wasn't clear how Japanese corporate culture would react to the arrival of this brash executive from France.

NICKISCH: This alliance with Nissan was a huge risk for Renault. This was their big shot at breaking out of the French market. And all of it was riding on one dude.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: I discussed with Carlos before him leaving for Tokyo after the deal was made. I told him, look; of course, if you do not succeed, we will both lose our jobs.

ARONCZYK: In 1999, Carlos Ghosn takes a small team from Renault to Japan to clear the managerial fog that had taken over Nissan. He is a force from the get-go. He sets aggressive goals. He cuts ties to some of Nissan's longtime but very expensive suppliers. Ghosn gets people in different departments to work together to figure out where to cut costs. And he promotes people based on merit instead of seniority, which had been the tradition.

NICKISCH: And he does all of this with a ruthless focus and discipline. There's a saying in France that someone has a clock in their stomach, and that was all Ghosn, churning through one problem after another, slicing complex business problems into 15-minute meetings.

ROUSSEAU: People told us at Nissan it's very easy with Ghosn. There is three subjects that interest him.

ARONCZYK: Here's French journalist Yann Rousseau again.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

ROUSSEAU: The first one is business, the second one is business, and the third one is business. So it's never personal. It's always - with journalists, with this team, with his colleagues, it's all about business. He's very secretive. He has his family life. He doesn't mix the two.

ARONCZYK: Within a couple of years, Nissan starts making money - a lot of money. Almost overnight, Carlos Ghosn becomes a corporate superhero.

NICKISCH: Ghosnmania sweeps through Japan. He's featured in comic books. He was constantly giving interviews on TV. Newspapers dissected his management style. And, yes, restaurants served those bento boxes with sushi laid out to look like his face.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn is at the top of his game, always playing the showman, reveling in the big, exciting things that were now happening at Nissan.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

NICKISCH: At this Tokyo motor show, Ghosn drives onto the stage in a new silver sports car. The 57-year-old with jet-black hair steps out, adjust his cufflinks and then launches into the sell.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: What you hear is the roar of Nissan's passion for performance. What you see is its ultimate physical expression, the all-new Nissan GT-R.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn launches five new models of cars in about eight minutes. One moment he's hyping a high-performance sports car, the next he's touting an electric vehicle, the precursor to the Nissan LEAF.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: In terms of emissions, though, ultimately, it's got to be zero.

NICKISCH: Years ahead of the competition, Ghosn is pushing Nissan ahead with all-electric cars. The auto industry press reveres him as a visionary.

ARONCZYK: Now, Ghosn's corporate superhero status in Japan makes things particularly tricky for Louis Schweitzer. 2005 - Schweitzer was finally ready to step down as CEO of Renault. The plan was for Carlos Ghosn to come back from Nissan and be his successor, to take over running Renault.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: Carlos Ghosn has a different memory of that than I have, but I'm quite certain my memory is correct. It is that we had agreed that when he would come back to France, he would relinquish his position at Nissan because I felt that two different companies 10,000 kilometers apart you cannot manage.

NICKISCH: Schweitzer says if Renault and Nissan had merged, this would be a different story. But they were really two different companies

ARONCZYK: Ghosn doesn't really want to leave Nissan. And Schweitzer begins to realize that he doesn't have all that much leverage to get Ghosn to come back to little, French Renault. I mean, Ghosn was a very big deal in Japan. They were arranging sushi in his likeness. And to hear Schweitzer tell it, Ghosn kind of pulled a fast one.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: So when the time came for him to become CEO of Renault, he told me, well, the guy I had pinpointed that we had discussed for my successor at Nissan, finally, he's not up to standard. And so I need a few more months to find somebody else. And, of course, this never happened.

NICKISCH: The best candidate is me, yeah.

SCHWEITZER: That, I think, was a mistake.

NICKISCH: Do you feel any responsibility for that?

SCHWEITZER: Well, quite frankly, I have asked myself this question quite often.

NICKISCH: That is how Carlos Ghosn became CEO of not one, but two car companies, eight time zones apart, with a total workforce of more than 250,000 people. And with this second job, Carlos Ghosn was now drawing two salaries. But back then, no one knew exactly how much he was making. Here's French journalist Yann Rousseau again, the one who met with Ghosn in prison.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

ROUSSEAU: At Renault, we knew exactly he is going to make 2 million or 3 million euros a year. Already, it's a scandal for the French. I mean, French are complaining - the workers, the trade unions, the governments - oh, it's too much. But we don't know publicly how much money he makes at Nissan.

NICKISCH: And there's a reason for this. To understand the Japanese view on executive pay, we spoke to a few experts. Hitotsubashi University professor Masako Egawa says her country has a history of paying executives far less than those in the U.S. or Europe.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

MASAKO EGAWA: Companies have been seen as a community, and CEO is the leader of the community. So it's very important for that leader to have sort of a reasonable relationship with the employees. There was a feeling that the CEO would be motivated by inherent wish to bring prosperity to the company and employees rather than getting a big pay.

NICKISCH: That tradition, she says, has to do with Japan's system of seniority promotion. You often join a company out of university and advance through the ranks. When someone gets promoted to an executive role, it's not like they're suddenly that much more valuable than you. Too much pay would create distance between you and the new boss.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SADAAKI NUMATA: It has been said about Japan's culture that a nail that sticks out gets hammered down very quickly.

ARONCZYK: This is former Ambassador Sadaaki Numata.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

NUMATA: And it all has to do with respect for harmony, our preference for harmony. If somebody earns too much money, he does stick out.

ARONCZYK: Ghosn was starting to stick out.

NICKISCH: Louis Schweitzer says even though French norms are similar to Japan's, Ghosn preferred the U.S. system, where the free market and performance incentives determine CEO pay.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: That Carlos liked money - I knew that. I mean, when I sent him to Nissan, the Japanese thought we had made a mistake in the number of zeros. It's OK. That's the American style. I mean, it's not my style. But I accepted this as an element of the, I would say, the culture of Carlos Ghosn.

NICKISCH: Starting in 2010, we get more information on the number of zeros in Ghosn's compensation. A new law in Japan requires disclosure of any salary above 100 million yen. That's around $1 million. And that year, Nissan reported that Ghosn earned nearly 10 times that threshold, nearly $10 million.

ARONCZYK: Now, that is low for an auto company CEO globally but extremely high for Japan. The CEO of Toyota, Japan's No. 1 carmaker, didn't even exceed the threshold. He wasn't even earning $1 million. At Nissan shareholder meetings, there were often questions about the high pay. In 2014, Ghosn defended his compensation in a talk with journalists in Tokyo.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: People look at this by say, yeah, but in Japan, you have the highest salary in Japan. Yes, it's true. But at the same time, Nissan cannot be considered only a Japanese company.

NICKISCH: Ghosn's point was that Nissan cannot be considered only a Japanese company, that it was a global company now. It's kind of ridiculous to say, we can't pay you what Volkswagen or Ford would pay you. Even so, Ghosn said that he recognized what he called the sensitivity in Japan.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GHOSN: Now, this has to be done in a way which is not provocative. It's a kind of fine art.

ARONCZYK: He said it's a kind of fine art to get paid at international CEO market rates in a country where that is not the norm. But what did he mean by fine art exactly and being paid in a sensitive, nonprovocative way?

NICKISCH: And maybe more crucially, how does an outsider like Ghosn know when he's gone too far, when he's provoked a culture that values harmony and where few want to stick out?

ARONCZYK: Over time, his mentor, Louis Schweitzer, thought Ghosn was starting to overreach, like when Ghosn tried to expand the alliance and get a third paycheck.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "HBR IDEACAST")

SCHWEITZER: The fact that he wanted to be the chairman and CEO of Renault and Nissan and, at one point of time between 2005 and 2009, he wanted also to have General Motors joining the group, you know, it showed that he had lost touch with reality.

NICKISCH: In 2018, executives at Nissan went to the Japanese government and said that Ghosn had officially gone too far. They allege that he broke the law, the one that Japan introduced in 2010 that you have to disclose your total pay. They argue that he failed to report $82 million of his retirement package.

ARONCZYK: Nissan executives gave the government, among other things, internal documents where you can see Ghosn's handwriting. He has taken a marker to some of the numbers, crossed them out and written in higher ones.

NICKISCH: Japanese authorities arrest him, and he spends 130 days in prison - you know, that place with the 15-minute bath time limit. When he's released on bail, a judge makes him surrender his three passports and $14 million.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S "COVER UP")

NICKISCH: Then he spent months at his Tokyo home awaiting trial. He told the media he would vigorously defend himself in court. But meanwhile, he was planning his escape in a box.

ARONCZYK: After the break, Carlos Ghosn makes the case for himself.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL ALEXIS PEMBERTON'S "COVER UP")

GHOSN: We're OK to go? OK, that's fine. OK, I'm yours, then.

NICKISCH: A few weeks ago, our team at Harvard Business Review interviewed Carlos Ghosn from his home in Beirut. He's been living as a fugitive - a pretty fancy fugitive - for the past year and a half. We asked him the burning question, what was he thinking while he was inside that box being loaded onto a jet?

GHOSN: You know, maybe somebody is going to open the box. Maybe the box is going to go through the X-rays. Anything can happen. So you don't want to be daydreaming about what's going to happen when you arrive to Beirut or, you know, the life you had before you been arrested. You really want to be concentrated on the present, listening to all the sound, making sure that you're ready to act if a dangerous situation, you know, unravels in front of you.

NICKISCH: Yeah. What was it like to look out the window and see Lebanon?

GHOSN: Oh, arriving in Beirut, with the very nice weather, deserted airport and the guy at customs telling me, hello, Mr. Ghosn, how are you? It has been a while. We didn't see you - was probably the most welcoming words I've ever heard for a very long time.

ARONCZYK: In some ways, though, Carlos Ghosn is still a prisoner. He can't leave Lebanon. There's an international arrest warrant out for him. And he hasn't been on a plane since he fled Japan. His life is very different than it was before he was arrested. Now he says he's enjoying the non-prison and non-CEO pleasures of life.

GHOSN: I sleep better. I enjoy particularly having breakfast with my wife without being rushed into taking a plane or going to the office. I can take a bath every day without limitation of time and with a big, thick towel. You know, I can't tell you - and this is the thing that in prison in Japan shocked me the most.

NICKISCH: Ghosn is proud of his time at Nissan. And, yes, he admits there was a postretirement pay package for him that he did not disclose. But he argues he didn't have to report that pay because he hadn't been paid it yet. Regardless, Ghosn still sees himself as the company's savior.

GHOSN: Well, you know, when I arrived in 1999, I was shocked at how boring Nissan was. The brand was boring. The product were boring. Nobody was talking about us. The only thing which was original in Nissan is my arrival. Yeah, there was something strange, exciting happening, and it was around me. You know, after the dullness, the sadness, the grayness of Nissan, all of a sudden things were exciting. So this hype - I wanted to maintain it because this hype, I wanted to transmit it to the brand, to the cars, to the technology. And it was very successful.

ARONCZYK: This is exactly how I feel about when I joined PLANET MONEY.

NICKISCH: Alrighty then.

We asked Ghosn about Schweitzer's accusation that perhaps he'd lost touch with reality.

GHOSN: You know, with all the due respect to Schweitzer, I think we're not hired because we are in touch with reality or not in touch with reality. We are hired to deliver results.

NICKISCH: There are a couple of ways to think about this saga of Carlos Ghosn. If you believe the Japanese case against him, Ghosn worked the system, putting his personal fortunes ahead of the company. Ghosn was greedy, and he didn't just break cultural norms; he also broke the law.

ARONCZYK: If you take Ghosn at his word, he was worth what he was being paid. His salary was in line with car executives around the world. And, really, this wasn't about hiding his salary or benefits. He alleges that this was just an underhanded way for Nissan's old guard to get rid of a superstar who was changing too many things too fast.

GHOSN: The only way to get rid of Carlos Ghosn is to totally incapacitate him, and totally incapacitate him was through the justice system.

ARONCZYK: Carlos Ghosn was facing up to 15 years in prison. He avoided the trial by jumping bail and fleeing Japan. Now, without a fair trial, we may never know whether Carlos Ghosn is truly guilty of these charges or not.

(SOUNDBITE OF GEOFF SMITH'S "STRIP PARADE")

NICKISCH: Meanwhile, he's facing a bunch of lawsuits, including one in the Netherlands that ordered him to give back $6 million. French authorities have also started looking into Carlos Ghosn's finances. They've seized some of his assets and are looking into his tax filings, the financing of lavish parties, millions spent on private planes and possible kickbacks to car dealerships in the Middle East. Ghosn continues to deny any wrongdoing.

(SOUNDBITE OF GEOFF SMITH'S "STRIP PARADE")

ARONCZYK: There is way more to this story - race-car-driving executives, a boardroom coup, a spy scandal. So go listen to the four-part podcast series. It's called "The Rise And Fall Of Carlos Ghosn," and it's from the Harvard Business Review show "HBR IdeaCast."

NICKISCH: Our series is based on reporting by Hans Greimel and William Sposato. Their new book is "Collision Course: Carlos Ghosn And The Culture Wars That Upended An Auto Empire." It's out this week.

ARONCZYK: Today's show was produced by Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi and mastered by Gilly Moon. PLANET MONEY's supervising producer is Alex Goldmark, and this episode was edited by Bryant Urstadt.

NICKISCH: Special thanks to Anne Saini, Scott Berinato, Maureen Hoch and Adi Ignatius.

ARONCZYK: I'm Amanda Aronczyk.

NICKISCH: And I'm Curt Nickisch. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
On November 18th, 2018, Carlos Ghosn was arrested in Japan.
Ghosn was the CEO of not one, but two global automakers
at the same time, Nissan in Japan and Renault in France.
Before his trial, Ghosn was being held and interrogated
in a concrete prison on the outskirts of Tokyo.
This was a man who was used to jetting around the world
to his palatial homes in Paris, Beirut, and Rio,
all paid for by Nissan.
Now, he got a 15-minute limit on his bathing time
and a hard futon in a cell,
all paid for by the Japanese government.
For a short time, journalists could visit him in prison.
So he was wearing civilian clothes, in a way,
some sport pants and a big sweater.
Jan Rousseau is the Tokyo correspondent
for France's business newspaper, Les Echos.
He was one of the very few reporters to visit Ghosn
while he was in prison.
And he had some kind of flip-flop,
the one you use here in Japan when you go to a public bath
because he couldn't have his nice shoes.
He was like that, but he was still very classy.
His hair was a little grayer and messier
because, you know, he used to put dark, how do you say?
Dye, dye or coloring, yeah.
He was dyeing his hair black to look younger.
He was still strong.
He was not complaining that much.
They didn't have much time together.
One guard stood right by writing down everything they said.
Another guard stood in the back of the room
with the stopwatch.
It's Japan, so it's 20 minutes sharp.
It's not 19.55, it's not 20.05,
it's 20 minutes sharp.
So the guy was telling us 10 minutes left,
five minutes left.
So Ghosn wanted to talk a lot, a lot,
and I feel he felt good to let go.
And for the first time,
we are hearing his official defense version.
That was the first time he was out there.
Ghosn would go on to share his official defense version
in this video statement.
The first message is I'm innocent.
Innocent of allegedly underreporting his pay
by millions of dollars,
transferring his personal financial losses
to Nissan's books, misusing company assets,
and funneling $5 million from a subsidiary
for personal gain.
I'm innocent of all the charges
that have been brought against me.
And I'm also innocent of all the accusation
that came around these charges
that are all biased, twisted,
in a way to paint a person of greed
and the person of dictatorship.
In the video, Ghosn says that he is the real victim here,
that he'd been working to merge Renault and Nissan
more closely,
but that the executives at Nissan
and the Japanese government did not want that.
That is why, he alleges,
they are conspiring to stop him.
Finally, what I would like to say is my big hope,
my biggest wish is to have a fair trial.
A few months later, as you might remember,
Ghosn decides that he's not going to get
a fair trial in Japan.
So before his trial begins,
he leaves his Tokyo home and rendezvous
with a former Green Beret and his son,
a duo who specialize in getting people out of places
where they don't want to be.
The dad-son team has prepared a music equipment box,
the kind you see roadies pushing around at a concert.
The box has got a few holes drilled into the bottom
so Ghosn can still breathe,
like a firefly in a jar.
He climbs into the box
and he's wheeled into the airport
through a private jet terminal,
so he bypasses security.
Then, this very, very expensive piece of cargo
is loaded onto a jet,
which takes off and flies towards Lebanon,
a country that happens to have
no extradition treaty with Japan.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money,
I'm Amanda Aronchik.
And I'm Kurt Nagesh.
Kurt is the host of an excellent
new four-part podcast series
called The Rise and Fall of Carlos Ghosn.
It's from the Harvard Business Review Show,
HBR Ideacast.
And Kurt has spent months looking into
one of the strangest corporate stories
that I've ever heard.
It's about a famous CEO,
so famous,
there is a bento box named after him,
and the famous CEO's escape from Japan.
In a box, not a bento box.
Today on the show,
how did Carlos Ghosn go from being
one of the world's most admired CEOs
to a fugitive from justice?
And what happens when a flashy,
Western-style CEO meets a culture
used to equality and harmony at work?
And yes, we talk to Carlos Ghosn,
the fugitive, himself.

A good place to start the story
of what went right and what went wrong
during Carlos Ghosn's time at Nissan
is with the person who put him there.
Hello, you are on the orange message box of...
Louis Schweitzer.
Please leave your message after the beep.
After a few voicemails and emails,
I got him on the line.
Oh, okay, my name is Louis Schweitzer.
I am now 78 years old
and I have had a varied career,
civil servant, company,
and not-for-profit institutions.
That's a modest way of putting it.
Louis Schweitzer was the chief of staff
for a prime minister of France
before going to the French carmaker Renault.
You may remember one of their best-known models.
It was called Le Car, really.
That is what it's called.
To his credit,
Le Schweitzer joined the company after Le Car.
He became the chair and CEO in 1992.
And like a responsible executive,
within a few years,
he was already thinking about who would succeed him.
There were very good people within Renault,
but none that I considered able
to become the CEO.
Schweitzer needed a deputy.
Renault was in debt,
in danger of bankruptcy.
Critics called Renault a bloated ward
of the French state.
And Schweitzer needed new blood
to help him turn the company around.
And he finds Carlos Ghosn,
in his early 40s,
born in Brazil,
raised in Lebanon,
educated at the top universities in France,
and clearly outstanding.
Schweitzer knows right away he's found his guy.
Well, he was a very impressive person
with a stamina,
a drive,
an intensity,
which I found quite extraordinary.
I told him immediately that if he succeeded,
he would be my successor.
In 1996,
Schweitzer hires Ghosn as his deputy.
Over three years,
Ghosn undertakes huge organizational changes,
streamlining production,
closing a factory,
and centralizing key operations.
Ghosn proves himself to be super rational,
super numbers-driven,
and extremely good at saving the company's money.
It's also kind of an oddball.
He does not seem like a creature
of the auto industry.
That is Sonari Glinton.
He used to be NPR's auto industry reporter.
You may have heard him on the show before.
He's interviewed Ghosn a bunch of times.
There are only two people in the auto industry
in the decade or change that I was in it
that I thought,
this dude is a thinker.
He's like an intellectual running a car company.
That's the difference.
That is what makes him different from other folks.
Sonari says the auto industry is full of executives
who are stereotypical car guys
or engineers who make their way up the ranks.
Carlos Ghosn just stood out in ways you wouldn't expect.
The average height of a CEO is definitely over 5'11".
He is not.
I don't know how tall he is,
but I know he is not a tall, imposing person.
And he makes up for that
by like being genuinely gregarious,
interested in you, sort of hyper-focused.
You know, he has these like really bushy eyebrows
and he's like just a small, intense person.
Like the person that kind of leans in a little much.
Ghosn's turnaround at Renault was so successful
and so rapid,
people started calling him the cost killer.
And this was at a time of consolidation
in the auto industry,
making cars as expensive
and big companies were teaming up
to try to save money and reach more buyers.
In 1998, there was this blockbuster deal,
the so-called merger of equals
between Mercedes-Benz in Germany
and Chrysler in the U.S.
And for someone as ambitious as Ghosn,
as Louis Schweitzer puts it,
Renault started to feel
too small, too French, too alone.
So the small, French and alone Renault
starts looking around
for its own corporate dance partner.
As it happens,
one of Japan's biggest carmakers, Nissan,
was in dire straits.
Nissan was losing heaps of money.
So they needed somebody
to cut the cost massively.
Schweitzer's like,
I have just the guy for you.
The cost killer himself,
Carlos Ghosn.
So Renault will use some of the pile of money
they just saved in their own turnaround
to help retool Nissan.
They'll spend $5 billion
to buy up more than a third of the company.
And they frame the whole deal as an alliance,
not a merger.
I don't know.
Can we just stop and comment
on how unlikely this all was?
Nissan was exporting millions of cars
around the world.
Renault was tiny in comparison.
And sending a senior executive from France
to go to Japan
to help them do a better job of making cars,
that's like sending somebody to France
to tell them how to make baguettes.
Also, Japan had very few foreign executives.
And it wasn't clear how Japanese corporate culture
would react to the arrival
of this brash executive from France.
This alliance with Nissan was a huge risk for Renault.
This was their big shot
at breaking out of the French market.
And all of it was riding on one dude.
I discussed with Carlos before him leaving for Tokyo
after the deal was made.
I told him, look, of course,
if you do not succeed,
we will both lose our jobs.
In 1999, Carlos Ghosn takes a small team
from Renault to Japan
to clear the managerial fog
that had taken over Nissan.
He is a force from the get-go.
He sets aggressive goals.
He cuts ties to some of Nissan's longtime,
but very expensive suppliers.
Ghosn gets people in different departments
to work together to figure out where to cut costs.
And he promotes people based on merit
instead of seniority,
which had been the tradition.
And he does all of this
with a ruthless focus and discipline.
There's a saying in France
that someone has a clock in their stomach,
and that was all Ghosn.
Turning through one problem after another,
slicing complex business problems into 15-minute meetings.
People told us in Nissan,
it's very easy with Ghosn.
There is three subjects that interest him.
Here's French journalist, Yann Rousseau, again.
The first one is business,
the second one is business,
and the third one is business.
So, it's never personal.
It's always with journalists,
with his team, with his colleague.
It's all about business.
He's very secretive.
He has his family life.
He doesn't mix the two.
Within a couple of years,
Nissan starts making money.
A lot of money.
Almost overnight,
Carlos Ghosn becomes a corporate superhero.
Ghosn mania sweeps through Japan.
He's featured in comic books.
He was constantly giving interviews on TV.
Newspapers dissected his management style.
And yes, restaurants served those bento boxes
with sushi laid out to look like his face.
Ghosn is at the top of his game,
always playing the showman,
reveling in the big, exciting things
that were now happening at Nissan.
At this Tokyo Motor Show,
Ghosn drives onto the stage in a new silver sports car.
The 57-year-old with jet black hair steps out,
adjusts his cufflinks,
and then launches into the cell.
What you hear is the roar
of Nissan's passion for performance.
What you see is its ultimate physical expression,
the all-new Nissan GT-R.
Ghosn launches five new models of cars
in about eight minutes.
One moment, he's hyping a high-performance sports car.
The next, he's touting an electric vehicle,
the precursor to the Nissan Leaf.
In terms of emissions, though,
ultimately, it's got to be zero.
Years ahead of the competition,
Ghosn is pushing Nissan ahead with all electric cars.
The auto industry press reveres him as a visionary.
Now, Ghosn's corporate superhero status in Japan
makes things particularly tricky for Louis Schweitzer.
2005, Schweitzer was finally ready
to step down as CEO of Renault.
The plan was for Carlos Ghosn to come back from Nissan
and be his successor to take over running Renault.
Carlos Ghosn has a different memory of that than I have,
but I'm quite certain my memory is correct,
is that we had agreed that when he would come back
to France, he would relinquish his position at Nissan,
because I felt that two different companies,
10,000 kilometers apart, you cannot manage.
Schweitzer says if Renault and Nissan had merged,
this would be a different story,
but they were really two different companies.
Ghosn doesn't really want to leave Nissan,
and Schweitzer begins to realize
that he doesn't have all that much leverage
to get Ghosn to come back to little French Renault.
I mean, Ghosn was a very big deal in Japan.
They were arranging sushi in his likeness,
and to hear Schweitzer tell it,
Ghosn kind of pulled a fast one.
So when the time came for him to become CEO of Renault,
he told me, well, the guy I had pinpointed
that we had discussed for my successor at Nissan
finally is not up to standard,
and so I need a few more months to find somebody else.
And of course, this never happened.
The best candidate is me, yeah.
That I think was a mistake.
Do you feel any responsibility for that?
Well, quite frankly, I have asked myself
this question quite often.
That is how Carlos Ghosn became CEO
of not one, but two car companies,
eight time zones apart, with a total workforce
of 250,000 people.
And with this second job,
Carlos Ghosn was now drawing two salaries.
But back then, no one knew exactly
how much he was making.
Here's French journalist Yann Rousseau again,
the one who met with Ghosn in prison.
Renault, we know exactly he's gonna make
two or three million euros a year.
Already, it's a scandal for the French.
I mean, French are complaining, the workers,
the trade unions, the government say, oh, it's too much.
But we don't know publicly
how much money he makes at Nissan.
And there's a reason for this.
To understand the Japanese view on executive pay,
we spoke to a few experts.
Hitotsubashi University Professor Masako Egawa
says her country has a history
of paying executives far less
than those in the US or Europe.
Companies have been seen as a community,
and CEO is the leader of the community.
So it's very important for that leader
to have sort of a reasonable relationship
with the employees.
There was a feeling that the CEO would be motivated
by inherent wish to bring prosperity
to the company and employees
rather than getting a big pay.
That tradition, she says,
has to do with Japan's system of seniority promotion.
You often join a company out of university
and advance through the ranks.
When someone gets promoted to an executive role,
it's not like they're suddenly
that much more valuable than you.
Too much pay would create distance
between you and the new boss.
It has been said about Japan's culture
that a nail that sticks out
gets hammered down very quickly.
This is former Ambassador Sadaki Numata.
And it all has to do with respect for harmony,
our preference for harmony.
If somebody earns too much money,
he does stick out.
Gohn was starting to stick out.
Louis Schweitzer says even though French norms
are similar to Japan's,
Gohn preferred the U.S. system
where the free market and performance incentives
determine CEO pay.
That Carlos liked money.
I knew that.
I mean, when I sent him to Nissan,
the Japanese thought we had made a mistake
in the number of zeros.
Okay, that's the American style.
I mean, it's not my style,
but I accepted this as an element of,
I would say, the culture of Carlos Gohn.
Starting in 2010, we get more information
on the number of zeros in Gohn's compensation.
A new law in Japan requires disclosure
of any salary above 100 million yen.
That's around $1 million.
And that year, Nissan reported that Gohn
earned nearly 10 times that threshold,
nearly $10 million.
Now, that is low for an auto company CEO globally,
but extremely high for Japan.
The CEO of Toyota, Japan's number one car maker,
didn't even exceed the threshold.
He wasn't even earning $1 million.
At Nissan shareholder meetings,
there were often questions about the high pay.
In 2014, Gohn defended his compensation
in a talk with journalists in Tokyo.
People look at this and say,
yeah, but in Japan, you're the highest seller in Japan.
Yes, true.
At the same time, Nissan,
it cannot be considered only as a Japanese company.
Gohn's point was that Nissan cannot be considered
only a Japanese company,
that it was a global company now.
It's kind of ridiculous to say,
we can't pay you what Volkswagen or Ford would pay you.
Even so, Gohn said that he recognized
what he called the sensitivity in Japan.
Now, this has to be done in a way which is not provocative.
It's a kind of fine art.
He said it's a kind of fine art
to get paid at international CEO market rates
in a country where that is not the norm.
But what did he mean by fine art exactly
and being paid in a sensitive, non-provocative way?
And maybe more crucially,
how does an outsider like Gohn know
when he's gone too far,
when he's provoked a culture that values harmony
and where few want to stick out?
Over time, his mentor, Louis Schweitzer,
thought Gohn was starting to overreach,
like when Gohn tried to expand the alliance
and get a third paycheck.
The fact that he wanted to be the chairman
and CEO of Renault and Nissan,
and at one point of time between 2005-2009,
he wanted also to have General Motors joining the group.
It showed that he had lost touch with reality.
In 2018, executives at Nissan went to the Japanese government
and said that Gohn had officially gone too far.
They alleged that he broke the law,
the one that Japan introduced in 2010,
that you have to disclose your total pay.
They argue that he failed to report $82 million
of his retirement package.
Nissan executives gave the government,
among other things,
internal documents where you can see Gohn's handwriting.
He has taken a marker to some of the numbers,
crossed them out and written in higher ones.
Japanese authorities arrest him
and he spends 130 days in prison,
that place with a 15-minute bath time limit.
When he's released on bail,
a judge makes him surrender his three passports
and $14 million.
Then he spent months at his Tokyo home awaiting trial.
He told the media he would vigorously defend himself
in court, but meanwhile,
he was planning his escape in a box.
After the break, Carlos Gohn makes the case for himself.
We're okay to go?
Okay, that's fine.
Okay, I'm yours then.
A few weeks ago, our team at Harvard Business Review
interviewed Carlos Gohn from his home in Beirut.
He's been living as a fugitive,
a pretty fancy fugitive for the past year and a half.
We asked him the burning question,
what was he thinking while he was inside that box
being loaded onto a jet?
You know, maybe somebody's gonna open the box.
Maybe the box is gonna go through the x-rays.
Anything can happen.
So you don't wanna be daydreaming
about what's gonna happen when you arrive to Beirut
or the life you had before you've been arrested.
You really want to be concentrated on the present,
listening to all the sound,
making sure that you're ready to act
if a dangerous situation unravels in front of you.
Yeah.
What was it like to look out the window and see Lebanon?
Oh, arriving in Beirut with a very nice weather,
deserted airport,
and the guy at customs telling me,
hello, Mr. Gohn, how are you?
It has been a while, we didn't see you,
was probably the most welcoming words
I've ever heard for a very long time.
In some ways though, Carlos Gohn is still a prisoner.
He can't leave Lebanon.
There's an international arrest warrant out for him.
And he hasn't been on a plane since he fled Japan.
His life is very different than it was
before he was arrested.
Now, he says, he's enjoying the non-prison
and non-CEO pleasures of life.
I sleep better.
I enjoy particularly having breakfast with my wife
without being rushed into taking a plane
or going to the office.
I can take a bath every day without limitation of time
and with a big thick towel.
I can tell you that this is the thing
that in prison in Japan shocked me the most.
Gohn is proud of his time at Nissan.
And yes, he admits there was a post-retirement
pay package for him that he did not disclose,
but he argues he didn't have to report that pay
because he hadn't been paid it yet.
Regardless, Gohn still sees himself
as the company's savior.
Well, when I arrived in 1999,
I was shocked by how boring Nissan was.
The brand was boring.
The product were boring.
Nobody was talking about us.
The only thing which was original in Nissan is my arrival.
Ah, there was something strange, exciting happening.
And it was around me.
After the dullness, the sadness, the grayness of Nissan,
all of a sudden things were exciting.
So this hype, I wanted to maintain it
because this hype I wanted to transmit it to the brand,
to the cars, to the technology,
and it was very successful.
This is exactly how I feel
about when I joined Planet Money.
Alrighty then.
We asked Gohn about Schweitzer's accusation
that perhaps he'd lost touch with reality.
You know, with all the due respect to Schweitzer,
I think we're not hired
because we are in touch with reality
or not touch in reality.
We are hired to deliver results.
There are a couple of ways to think about this saga
of Carlos Gohn.
If you believe the Japanese case against him,
Gohn worked the system,
putting his personal fortunes ahead of the company.
Gohn was greedy and he didn't just break cultural norms,
he also broke the law.
If you take Gohn at his word,
he was worth what he was being paid.
His salary was in line with car executives
around the world.
And really, this wasn't about hiding
his salary or benefits.
He alleges that this was just an underhanded way
for Nissan's old guard to get rid of a superstar
who was changing too many things too fast.
The only way to get rid of Carlos Gohn
is to totally incapacitate him.
And totally incapacitating him was the justice system.
Carlos Gohn was facing up to 15 years in prison.
He avoided the trial by jumping bail and fleeing Japan.
Now, without a fair trial,
we may never know whether Carlos Gohn
is truly guilty of these charges or not.
Meanwhile, he's facing a bunch of lawsuits,
including one in the Netherlands
that ordered him to give back $6 million.
French authorities have also started looking
into Carlos Gohn's finances.
They've seized some of his assets
and are looking into his tax filings,
the financing of lavish parties,
millions spent on private planes,
and possible kickbacks to car dealerships
in the Middle East.
Gohn continues to deny any wrongdoing.
There is way more to this story.
Race car driving executives, a boardroom coup,
a spy scandal.
