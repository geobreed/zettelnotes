What do you do when you can't find the perfect pasta shape? You invent a new shape. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.



Dan Pashman's cascatelli pasta
Scott Gordon Bleicher/Sporkful

There are dozens of different pasta shapes. But for Dan Pashman, host of The Sporkful podcast and pastaficionado, none of them are perfect. That's why, three years ago, Dan embarked on a journey to create the ideal pasta. This meant designing the pasta shape himself — then figuring out how to manufacture and sell thousands of pounds of it.

But creating a new pasta shape takes more than a man with a dream, some flour and some water. It takes expert counsel, heavy machinery, international phone calls. And quite a bit of money.

Today on the show, Dan joins us to talk about his obsession with the ideal pasta, and the journey to make his dream a reality.

Music: "You Can Hear The Birds Again" and "Rise Strong."

You can listen to Dan's quest to achieve noodle nirvana in the Mission: ImPASTAble series at The Sporkful.

Cascatelli is available at Sfoglini

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

EMILY: Daddy, how long will it take for you to invent this pasta that you've been talking about?

DAN PASHMAN: Does it feel like it's taking a long time?

EMILY: Yeah, because a long, long time ago, you were talking about it. And I would still hear when you're trying to invent it.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

Dan Pashman, that is you and your daughter Emily. And she is talking with you about this quest you have been on to invent a new pasta shape.

PASHMAN: That's right, Jacob. Yeah, I have actually spent the last three years and many thousands of dollars and many sleepless nights trying to invent a new pasta shape.

GOLDSTEIN: And you've been talking about this recently on the podcast that you host, a food podcast called "The Sporkful." And obviously, I love a podcast stunt as much as the next person. But I do want to ask you, why this stunt? Why are you trying to invent a new kind of pasta?

PASHMAN: Well, first off, I mean, I've been hosting a food podcast for 11 years. The show is largely driven by my opinions about food. And yet I'm not a trained chef. And I started to come to realize that I've never actually made anything. You know, like, I mess around in my kitchen. But do I actually know what I'm talking about?

GOLDSTEIN: Like, are you for real?

PASHMAN: Right. Like, do I know anything? Or am I just another guy with a microphone? And, like, why pasta? Well, as much as I love pasta, Jacob, I think there's a lot of mediocre shapes out there. You know, I want a pasta shape that will pick up a lot of sauce, that I can really sink my teeth into, that will stay on the fork without too much trouble and one that will be interesting and varied to eat over the course of the entire bowl, not a pasta that's just a one-note song that may be good at the first bite and boring by the fourth bite.

And while there's a lot of good shapes out there, I think it's very hard to find one that checks all those boxes. And so I wanted to see, like, can I make one that would? And not just like - I'm not just talking in a theoretical way, Jacob. I want to actually get this pasta shape made, like, produce thousands of boxes and actually sell it. And that has proven to be a lot harder than I thought it would be.

GOLDSTEIN: And yet...

PASHMAN: And yet, this week, it's finally happening.

GOLDSTEIN: Dan Pashman, let me be the first to say, hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jacob Goldstein.

PASHMAN: I'm Dan Pashman from "The Sporkful" podcast.

GOLDSTEIN: And today on the show, Dan, you are going to take us deep into the world of pasta, into your journey trying to invent a new kind of pasta that has never existed on planet Earth before - and not just to invent it, but to make thousands of pounds of it and sell it, ideally for a profit, or at least for not too much of a loss.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

PASHMAN: So, Jacob, the first thing you need if you want to make a new shape of pasta or really any shape of pasta, you need a piece of equipment called a die. And the die is basically the mold for the shape. Like you remember, Jacob, the Play-Doh factory? Push the Play-Doh through a hole shaped like a star.

GOLDSTEIN: I actually had the Play-Doh barbershop. It was, like, the plastic person who had a bunch of little holes in their head. And you pushed the Play-Doh up through their head, and it comes out as hair, and then you cut it.

PASHMAN: Wow. That's how pasta is made. You put a blob of dough in, and a pasta shape comes out.

GOLDSTEIN: I love it.

PASHMAN: But designing and manufacturing pasta dies is a very specialized skill. Even most big pasta companies don't do it themselves. A lot of them hire this one company called D. Maldari & Sons. D. Maldari & Sons has designed the dies for noodles for all the big players. Like, if you've eaten any kind of dried pasta in America, you've eaten something that came from one of Maldari's dies. I mean, Campbell's chicken noodle soup, Kraft mac and cheese - those dried pastas are extruded through Maldari dies.

Back in 2019, just as I was getting going with this project, I went to the company's office out on Staten Island to talk to Chris Maldari, who runs the company now. He is the guy who can tell me what I need to do to make my pasta real.

How'd you get into this?

CHRIS MALDARI: I was born into it.

PASHMAN: D. Maldari & Sons has been in Chris' family since 1901. He and his brother took over the company after their dad passed away. When I went to see him, he showed me a bunch of different shapes that they've made over the years.

MALDARI: So like, you know, something like this is - we've done. You can see it in the store. It's SpongeBob. I mean, really, you should know that.

PASHMAN: Yeah, no, no. I could tell it was SpongeBob.

MALDARI: And you know who that is, right?

PASHMAN: Is that Lucy from "Peanuts"?

MALDARI: He's unbelievable. Now, what about that?

PASHMAN: I know what that is.

MALDARI: You sure?

PASHMAN: Yeah. That's, like, not safe for work, as we would say.

MALDARI: OK. So you know what's funny about that is we had a company that wanted to make it. We couldn't find a manufacturer because they were afraid one of these slips in with the kids, you know, SpongeBob mac and cheese. It's a problem.

PASHMAN: (Laughter).

Anyhoo, Chris knows better than anyone in America if it will be physically possible to make the pasta shape that I dream up.

So here's what I'm doing, Chris. I am setting out to invent a new pasta shape and to actually get it made and to actually sell it.

MALDARI: Right. OK. That's what we do.

PASHMAN: What would I need to give you for you to be able to make that prototype? I mean, like, do I need to - do I need blueprints? Do I need, like, 3D renderings?

MALDARI: No, no.

PASHMAN: Can I describe it to you?

MALDARI: Money.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDSTEIN: Money - I love that answer, Pashman. I love it.

PASHMAN: (Laughter) Chris is nothing if not direct.

GOLDSTEIN: So - OK, so money. So what does he tell you? How does he lay it out for you?

PASHMAN: Well, he says, look; the very least any company is going to want to make is 5,000 boxes of pasta. You know, it's one pound per box.

MALDARI: I'd probably say if you were looking - if your end goal was to get 5,000 boxes of dried pasta in your dream shape - right? - between all the experimentation and then getting it done, you're probably looking at 25 grand.

PASHMAN: Now, that's a nonstarter for me. So as I tell Chris, my plan is I'm not going to pay for the whole thing out of my pocket. I'll got a pasta company to partner with me. They'll share in the costs and in the profits if there ever are any. And remember, Chris is the guy who makes the die, the Play-Doh mold thingy. He doesn't actually make pasta. So I got to find a company that makes pasta that will work with me.

Problem is, Chris says the big companies are too big. They're not going to want to waste any time with a pipsqueak like me. And then there are a lot of small artisanal shops, but they only make fresh pasta. They don't dry it, let alone box it and ship it.

GOLDSTEIN: OK, so that leaves nothing for you.

PASHMAN: That's right. I need someone in between. I need one that's not too big and not too small. I need my Goldilocks pasta company.

GOLDSTEIN: So what do you do?

PASHMAN: So my producers and I set out to try to find Goldilocks. Our producer Ngofeen Mputubwele - he speaks Italian. So he calls up a pasta company based in Italy called Garofalo.

NGOFEEN MPUTUBWELE: If we want to, like, work with you guys to get a pasta made, like, what would the process even look like?

FLAVIA: Let me say everything can be done, but there are - like, changing a die on a production line is a very big deal. It's not like when you're blending your shake in the morning and you change from chopping to...

MPUTUBWELE: Yeah, puree.

FLAVIA: ...Just - exactly. It's, like, a very long process that requires time and stopping the line, all meaning that it has a cost involved in this.

PASHMAN: The equipment in a factory like Garofalo's runs 24/7. One production line cranks out nearly 10,000 pounds of pasta an hour. So if they're going to make my pasta, they got to stop a production line, spend a couple of days changing the die out and then get it back and running. So, you know, every minute they're not making pasta costs them money.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. So to change the die is so costly for them that they have to make a lot of pasta in order to make up for that cost. Classic economy of scale, right? If you go to the trouble to retool your factory, you've got to make a lot of the thing that you're making.

PASHMAN: That's right. And I don't want a lot. I want 5,000 pounds of pasta.

MPUTUBWELE: And is there a minimum run, like the number of, like, pounds or units that...

FLAVIA: Yeah, there is. Usually around 1,200 cases for a long cut.

MPUTUBWELE: Oh, OK. Because we'll be selling it to our audience, that actually is a reasonable thing, which is kind of cool.

FLAVIA: I'm talking, Ngofeen, cases. In each case, there's 20 packs. Cases, not packs. Yeah, cases.

MPUTUBWELE: (Laughter) Just kidding.

(LAUGHTER)

FLAVIA: You're talking 24,000, yeah.

MPUTUBWELE: (Laughter) Right.

PASHMAN: So 24,000 pounds gives me an image of my driveway piled high with boxes of pasta and my wife and kids and I frantically addressing packages by hand.

GOLDSTEIN: Nightmare.

PASHMAN: That's not going to work. So after months and months of calling around, we finally find a company that we think might be our Goldilocks.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

STEVE GONZALEZ: Sfoglini Pasta.

PASHMAN: Hi. Is this Steve?

GONZALEZ: This is.

PASHMAN: This is Steve Gonzalez from Sfoglini Pasta. He's a chef who co-founded Sfoglini in 2012.

Why pasta?

GONZALEZ: I mean, I've always enjoyed making pasta, so it just kind of seemed like a good direction. We really didn't do any market research or put too much thought into it. We just kind of blindly went into it.

PASHMAN: I like that, Steve. I haven't done any market research either.

(LAUGHTER)

PASHMAN: Sfoglini is based in rural upstate New York, near Albany, but they sell all over the country. They're in Whole Foods, bunch of specialty stores.

GONZALEZ: Our machine does about a thousand pounds an hour.

PASHMAN: And is it running 24 hours a day?

GONZALEZ: I wish.

PASHMAN: (Laughter).

GONZALEZ: No, it runs about eight to 10 hours a day, six days a week. Technically, by scale, we're actually small.

GOLDSTEIN: But, Dan, are they small enough for you?

PASHMAN: Right, exactly. So then we start talking about minimums. And I'm just like, please let it be 5,000.

GONZALEZ: Technically, if we turn our machine on and put the labor in, we tried, we have a 6,000-pound minimum.

GOLDSTEIN: Pashman, can you do 6,000?

PASHMAN: I hereby declare that to be close enough, Jacob.

(LAUGHTER)

PASHMAN: We have found our Goldilocks. But I try to play it cool with Steve.

So, Steve, here's the big question. I mean, this sounds great. It sounds like you are well-equipped to help me in this journey and to possibly partner together. Why should we use you?

GONZALEZ: This is - I'm not a good salesman. If you want to work with somebody else, go work with them. That's totally fine.

(LAUGHTER)

GONZALEZ: You should come down to the factory and, like, actually start to see the equipment. I think it will give you a better feel, and I think you might be able to, like, start to wrap your head around what the process is going to be.

PASHMAN: All right. I'm going to keep working on the designs. And then once I have a better idea what the shape is going to look like, I'm going to come visit you.

GONZALEZ: OK. Sounds good. Our door's open.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDREA PERRY SONG, "RISE STRONG")

GOLDSTEIN: After the break, a shape of pasta that literally has never been seen before by anyone ever in history.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDREA PERRY SONG, "RISE STRONG")

GOLDSTEIN: We are now in 2020, well into your journey.

PASHMAN: I think it's going to be a great year, Jacob. What could possibly go wrong?

GOLDSTEIN: Definitely no global pandemics are going to happen, and you're just going to get on a train and go up to Sfoglini's pasta factory in upstate New York for the first time.

PASHMAN: That's right. I'm going to go meet them in person and try to seal the deal.

You must be Steve.

GONZALEZ: Hey.

PASHMAN: Steve's the guy I talked to on the phone. He's a chef, and he oversees the actual pasta making. He's wearing a baseball cap all caked in flour. His hair is sticking out in all directions at once.

Oh, you're giving me a hairnet. Thank you. It smells like pasta in here.

This pasta plant is big enough to fit a medium-sized airplane. They actually used to make parts for Boeing here. And then the machine that makes the pasta is sort of over on one side, kind of reminds me of a kid's playground like you see in a park 'cause it's got stairs to go up to a second level, and there's this lookout platform. And then the pasta comes down from there as if it's on a slide.

It's actually very simple.

GONZALEZ: It's very simple.

(LAUGHTER)

GONZALEZ: There's not - there's nothing too complicated about it.

PASHMAN: So now we have little rigatonis, little tubes with ridges on the outside, dropping out of this conveyor belt.

So I finish up the tour, take off my lab coat and hairnet, even though I quite like the hairnet, and I meet up with the other co-founder of Sfoglini to talk business.

SCOTT KETCHUM: Scott Ketchum, vice president.

PASHMAN: Scott handles the business side. Time for us to try to make a deal. Here's what I propose. So like I said, so I would maintain ownership of the shape, exclusive license to Sfoglini.

GOLDSTEIN: So, Dan, when I listen to that tape and I hear you say maintain ownership of the shape, what does it mean to own a shape?

PASHMAN: Well, I think, really, it means to own a patent on the shape.

GOLDSTEIN: So do you own a patent on a pasta shape?

PASHMAN: I did apply for a patent for this shape, yes - patent pending.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

PASHMAN: Patent pending. I just said it. My attorney will be pleased.

GOLDSTEIN: OK, this is a thing one can do. So, OK, so what deal are you proposing to Sfoglini?

PASHMAN: So I propose to them, look; I'll pay for the die, all the testing, manufacturing of the die.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

PASHMAN: And I say they'll pay for the actual making of the pasta, including all the testing, the labor and then the actual final manufacturing, the boxes.

GOLDSTEIN: Flour - I mean, the actual food in there, yeah.

PASHMAN: Exactly. And then when money starts coming in, we will each be paid back in proportion to our initial investments.

KETCHUM: Well, I think conceptually, it's a great fit for us. I mean, Steve picked out a lot of unique shapes when we started the company because we wanted to really be known for having different offerings than what everybody else had. So this is just an evolution of that. Be great for us to be a part of it.

GOLDSTEIN: He's in. OK, this is good.

PASHMAN: Yes, it is good. But there's one potential problem, which is that I spent months of my life dreaming about this pasta. I've never actually shown it to anyone who knows anything about pasta. So the next step is I got to find out if it's physically possible to make my idea. I decide to show it to the Sfoglini guys.

So this is still, you know, a rough draft, you know, very much open to discussion. I even got graph paper. It looks more official. Here it is. So it's a long shape. It bears some resemblance to mafalda or mafaldine.

GOLDSTEIN: Pashman, what is mafalda?

PASHMAN: OK, so picture fettuccine - like, a long, flat noodle.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

PASHMAN: But down the edges, you have ruffles.

GOLDSTEIN: Got it. OK, so that's like the start for your pasta. What else?

PASHMAN: That's my base canvas. And then on top of the flat strip, running the length of the noodle, I want to add a narrow tube.

GOLDSTEIN: Like, running down the middle.

PASHMAN: That's right. That way you get all the benefits of tubes and ruffles and flat pieces. You get it all.

KETCHUM: It's a complex noodle that you've put together.

GOLDSTEIN: It is a complex noodle, and he sounds terrified.

(LAUGHTER)

PASHMAN: There was a lot of squinting going on in that meeting as they tried to analyze my sketch. But I decided to take that as a compliment. And, look; Scott and Steve, they think it's a good start. But the truth is they're not the ones, Jacob, who can tell me whether it's physically possible to produce a pasta in this shape.

GONZALEZ: I think the real person, the dream crusher or dream realizer is going to be the Maldari guys. They're going to be the ones that are going to tell you whether this is really possible or not.

GOLDSTEIN: Maldari like Chris Maldari, the guy in Staten Island who you went to see at the beginning of this whole thing.

PASHMAN: Yeah, that's right. He is the pasta die maker. So I send my sketch over to him. A week goes by, and that week is just interminable. It's like, you know, that feeling when you're waiting for something that's really important to you, like a pregnancy test or that coconut cake you ordered online.

GOLDSTEIN: When is it going to come?

PASHMAN: Finally, I get him on the phone.

MALDARI: I'd love to help you. I'd love to take your money to make you sample dies and do the whole test.

PASHMAN: But he says the laws of pasta physics will just not allow this shape.

GOLDSTEIN: Damn.

PASHMAN: Basically, as dough passes through the die, the movement required to create the ruffles would crush the tube.

MALDARI: In all good conscience, I can't tell you that you're going to get anywhere with this idea.

PASHMAN: That was not what I wanted to hear, Jacob. And then from there, everything got worse. I mean, the next iteration of the shape also turned out to be impossible. When we finally had something we thought would work, we couldn't get any bronze to make the die because of COVID - all these shortages and delays in manufacturing. Then, we finally thought we had something that really did work, and then there was another problem with the die and the shape came out all wrong and I had a complete and total meltdown.

And this had an impact on my whole family.

JANIE: So I'm kind of over it.

PASHMAN: This is my wife, Janie, pouring herself breakfast cereal while being totally over my pasta project.

JANIE: With the amount of effort and work you put into it, like, you could've, like - I don't know - created three new podcasts or something.

(SOUNDBITE OF CEREAL BAG RUSTLING)

JANIE: It's not just the amount of work that it is, but it's like, you know, there's like no days off. You know, there's a pandemic. The kids are home half the time. And the emotional roller coaster of, like, you know, you being like, OK, I think this is going to be good, and then, you know, 24 hours later, like, this is a disaster; everything sucks. Like, I just - I don't know. I don't really have any more emotional - I don't have excess emotions to console you over the pasta project right now. Sorry, not sorry (laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: Well, I don't even know what happens next. Where do we go with that?

PASHMAN: Well, you know, Janie may have wanted off the roller coaster, but at that point, I was handcuffed to it. So, you know, we took the die back to the factory, made more refinements, made a bunch of changes to the shape. The closed tube became half a tube. The ruffles moved around. We came in from a long shape to a short shape. We tweaked, and we refined. And finally, the day came, Jacob - February 18, 2021, just a few weeks ago.

GOLDSTEIN: Almost just now, OK, yeah.

PASHMAN: That's right. I drove up to Sfoglini. Everything felt like it was coming together. When I get there, I talk with the Sfoglini guys about how much this project actually cost us in the end.

What's your total?

KETCHUM: Right now, I'm at $4,338. And the actual run today is another 8,000.

PASHMAN: OK.

KETCHUM: So in total, that's about $12,300.

PASHMAN: And my cost for the die ended up being nearly $10,000 - more than I expected, but there was a lot of tweaking that had to happen. So total cost - my 10,000 plus their 12 and change - total cost - 22,000 and change.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. And so for that, you get 5,000 boxes of pasta. Is that right?

PASHMAN: Well, that's what we were hoping for. But it turns out because of COVID, there are major paper shortages, and so they weren't able to get 5,000 actual physical boxes.

GOLDSTEIN: Oh, man. So how many boxes of pasta do you get for your $22,000?

PASHMAN: Almost 4,000 boxes.

GOLDSTEIN: So - OK, so you've got $22,000 for 4,000 boxes. So the cost to you guys is a little over five bucks a box. How much are you selling the pasta for?

PASHMAN: Four ninety-nine a box.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) I got some bad news for you, Pashman.

PASHMAN: (Laughter) Have I not been paying attention during past episodes of PLANET MONEY well enough, Jacob (laughter)?

GOLDSTEIN: So if you sell out your first run, you will lose money.

PASHMAN: That's right. But a lot of that cost was to, you know, to get started. So if this first run sells out quickly enough, we'll make more. And soon after that, we will be back in the black.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. I hope it works out for you.

PASHMAN: Thanks, Jacob. This day when we talked about the money, this was also the day they were going to start making my pasta shape at the factory. I mean, this is the shape I've been dreaming about, I've been having nightmares about. It has tormented me for years. I'm finally going to get to see it be born.

I walk into the factory, and for the first time, I see my die. It's a bronze disc about the size of a very thick manhole cover.

Is this the die? This is my die. Oh, my God. I got to say I'm feeling the kinds of emotions that you feel, like, when you look at your kid, when your kid's been really, really irritating. And it's like, you still love them, but at that exact moment, you're like, do you know what you're putting me through?

Let me tell you, this die is very pampered. First, they have to give it a warm water bath to heat it up so the dough flows through it better. Then the die gets hooked on a crane and raised up into the machine.

Go little die. You can do it.

All right, the die is in place. The semolina flour is loaded in. There's just one thing left to do.

GONZALEZ: You want to start it?

PASHMAN: Can I press the button?

GONZALEZ: Yeah.

PASHMAN: Oh, my gosh. I'm feeling excited. I feel, like, a little giddy.

GONZALEZ: Well, let's start it.

PASHMAN: You don't want to just keep talking about it (laughter)?

GONZALEZ: I mean, we can. I'd rather make the pasta and see where we're...

PASHMAN: All right, pressing the button. Here we go. You ready? Here I go. Three, two, one.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINE WHIRRING)

PASHMAN: The flour and the water get mixed together and pushed through the die. And all of a sudden, coming out onto the conveyor belt is my pasta shape. It's a short shape about the length of your pinky finger. It's curled in a unique way, kind of like a comma or half a heart. It's got a bump along one side, and on the other side, two ruffles running alongside each other. If you hold it vertically, the ruffles look kind of like flowing water, makes the whole thing look kind of like a waterfall, which is, in fact, what we named it. We named it cascatelli, Italian for waterfalls.

GONZALEZ: Are you sad today?

PASHMAN: Suddenly - I didn't feel sad until just the moment when I pressed the button. It's like, you know, when you have something in your life that is, like, so all-consuming, it's, you know, it's like, when it's over, you don't know what to do with yourself.

GOLDSTEIN: So what do you do with yourself?

PASHMAN: Well, I wait to see if anyone buys this pasta or if I end up with a thousand pounds of it in my basement (laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDREA PERRY SONG, "YOU CAN HEAR THE BIRDS AGAIN")

PASHMAN: And I should say, Jacob, we only covered a tiny bit of this quest here today on PLANET MONEY. There's a lot more to this story in "The Sporkful's" podcast series "Mission: ImPASTAble."

GOLDSTEIN: That's how you want to go out, Pashman? You want to go out on "Mission: ImPASTAble"?

PASHMAN: Put it on my tombstone, Jacob (laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks for coming on the show, man. The pasta is delicious. Nice work.

PASHMAN: Thanks. I appreciate it.

GOLDSTEIN: We'll post pictures of Dan's pasta shape, cascatelli, on our various social media feeds. We're @planetmoney everywhere. Also, you can email us. We're planetmoney@npr.org.

This is Planet Money from NPR.
Back when she was in high school, Carolyn Anzaldua was working at a McDonald's in Houston, Texas,
trying to save money for college.
But all of her friends were working at other restaurants where they got tips.
They got to leave every night with cash and they would say,
oh my gosh, I went in and I made $100 on one night and I was like, wow.
So she starts applying for server positions and she gets hired at Olive Garden.
I did go in with some sort of blind optimism.
I was like, oh, this is so cool because they're so busy all the time.
It'll be, it'll be great.
But it was a lot, it was a lot harder there than I had anticipated it to be.
Part of why it was so much harder is because of what Olive Garden is known for.
Like, if you know one thing about Olive Garden, it's the breadsticks.
Unlimited breadsticks.
Breadsticks forever.
Carb overload.
And unlimited soup and unlimited salad.
I think a lot of people don't realize that the servers at Olive Garden make the salad and soup themselves,
which when you have a party and people want different things,
they want extra this and this on the side, it makes it very complicated.
But the money could be good on busy days like the weekends.
She could make like $25 an hour, but then there were the slow days.
If you're standing there and you're not getting any work, you're not getting any tables,
you just know that you're absolutely wasting your time.
It's like, oh man, it's very frustrating for sure.
The worst part was the customers who would leave next to nothing in tips.
Or actually nothing.
When someone just disregards you by not leaving you anything, it is, it's hurtful.
Like, you know, for sure.
Yeah, after having like looked you in the eye for like an hour.
Exactly, yes.
And smiled with you and talked with you and kind of joked with you,
and then it's just like, well, I don't care about you.
But she says it wasn't just the feeling of disrespect that bummed her out.
It was also the fact that her entire financial well-being was completely dependent on these strangers.
That's because Olive Garden was paying her the federal minimum wage for tipped workers.
$2.13, like that measly little like handful of change.
$2.13.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Greg Rosalski.
And I'm Mary Childs.
Carolyn's measly little handful of change is the reality for tipped workers across the country every time they pick up their paycheck.
That's because tipped workers get a special minimum wage that is much lower than the standard one.
And it's been the same rate, $2.13 an hour, for decades.
The last time it was raised was 1991.
And the parent company of Olive Garden and some of its big restaurant friends are fighting really hard to keep it that way.
Today on the show, why is the special minimum wage for tipped workers been frozen for so long?
And what would it mean to raise it all the way up to $15 an hour?
The restaurant industry is among the most devastated in our economy right now,
which makes it either the perfect time or the worst time to totally overhaul it.

For a long time, the federal government did not guarantee a minimum wage for a huge number of Americans.
Workers in agriculture, domestic work, most tipped jobs, weren't guaranteed a minimum wage.
And historians believe a large reason for this was race.
Those industries had a higher proportion of Black workers.
In 1966, in the midst of the civil rights movement and the war on poverty,
President Lyndon Baines Johnson, LBJ, the fighting LBJster,
signed a bill that expanded the minimum wage to workers who previously didn't get it.
It was a big deal.
We have included more than nine million new workers under a higher minimum wage.
This new law created a new special minimum wage for tipped workers.
It was lower than the standard one.
The idea was tips would make up the difference.
And if workers didn't make enough tips, then employers were legally obligated to pony up
and make sure that they did make the standard minimum wage per hour.
So no one is actually supposed to make that measly little handful of change, the tipped minimum wage.
This is just the minimum amount employers have to pay workers.
If they don't make enough tips, then workers are supposed to get compensated.
The employer has to pay.
So that's how the tipped minimum wage is supposed to work.
And for decades after 1966, every time Congress would raise the standard minimum wage,
it would increase the tipped minimum wage at the same time.
That is until the mid-90s. And this guy.
And for those of you who may not be familiar with me, I am Herman Cain.
That is the late Herman Cain in 1995 testifying before Congress about the minimum wage.
You might know him from his presidential run.
But before that, he was the successful CEO of Godfather's Pizza
and the president of the National Restaurant Association, the NRA.
Not the gun NRA.
Right, the food NRA. No guns.
Just to be clear.
The other NRA.
The National Restaurant Association, which is the leading trade group
for the over 740,000 restaurant and food service entities in this country.
In other words, it's the restaurant industry lobby.
It represents restaurant owners and operators.
And Cain was making the same arguments to Congress then
that you'll still hear conservative economists make today.
Raising the minimum wage, it's bad for business, and it will kill jobs.
When you make it more expensive to hire people who lack basic work skills and experience,
you risk shutting them out of the workforce.
So they struck a deal.
The NRA ended up budging on raising that standard minimum wage.
But they said, keep your hands off the tipped minimum wage.
We don't want you raising the tipped minimum wage like ever again.
And apparently it worked.
The federal government froze the minimum wage for tipped workers at $2.13.
That was the rate that was set in 1991.
So decades ago, 30 years ago, the standard minimum wage has gone up five times since then.
But the tipped one? We are still at $2.13.
So that's how we got here.
It's why Carolyn, when she was at the Olive Garden,
she was getting that measly little handful of change.
And now the question that Washington is debating is, should we change that?
Should Olive Garden servers and IHOP busboys and everyone else who makes tips for a living,
should they get a higher minimum wage?
Right now, the standard minimum wage set by the federal government is $7.25 an hour.
Democrats in the Senate have proposed the Raise the Wage Act,
which would create one minimum wage for everybody in every industry.
$15 an hour for all workers, including tipped ones.
In other words, goodbye special tip minimum wage.
Now, this wouldn't happen overnight.
The tipped wage would get to $15 an hour over seven years.
And just to be clear, restaurant workers would still get tips.
It's just that their base pay, their paycheck would be much higher.
So this is a big, charged, important issue.
People have strong opinions.
We're going to lay out two of the main arguments here.
So first up, Sean Kennedy.
He is the public affairs guy at the National Restaurant Association, the Food NRA, not the gun one.
Is it like West Side Story, the NRA versus the NRA?
We aren't in the same meetings and we don't represent the same folks.
We hope that everybody enjoys going to a restaurant.
But our policy priorities are very different.
I feel like if there was a West Side Story sort of situation,
they would probably win because they have more guns.
Possibly.
So Sean makes a lot of those Herman Cain arguments from the 90s,
but he has even more urgency now
because the restaurant industry is a disaster zone.
Millions of restaurant workers aren't getting a wage at all.
Since the coronavirus pandemic has started,
110,000 restaurants around the country have shut down.
Now is not the right time to be putting increased costs onto restaurants.
The NRA just surveyed restaurants around the country
and they asked them, what would the Raise the Wage Act do to you?
And 82% said it will make it harder for us to recover,
harder for us to open our doors, harder for us to bring on more employees.
Even if we're not all worried about, you know,
contracting a deadly virus every time we go out,
he says the restaurant industry is hard and this would only make it harder.
Restaurants are barely profitable on a good day,
about a profit margin of about 5% to 6%.
So a proposal that would increase the tip wage in some instances by 600%,
what's going to happen to restaurants and revenue as a result of this?
We're talking about $2.13 to $15.
He's like, that's huge. We've never done anything like this before.
And he argues, nobody's actually supposed to make $2.13 an hour.
Federal law clearly states if workers' tips don't get them
to that standard minimum wage $7.25 an hour or more,
employers have to make up the difference.
If they have a shift where no one walks into the door,
by law, they're guaranteed the minimum wage.
Their employer is going to pay them the minimum wage, period.
End of story.
But, like, is it really the end of the story?
Probably not because we have a whole other act.
It's literally not the end.
And we're going to hear from another side.
Yeah, we're still going to tell the story.
It's definitely not the end of the story.
And we're asking all restaurants including the Olive Garden.
Excuse me.
Hey, they're all workers.
Next up, we hear from Perk, the leading activist for Change.
OK, we've heard from the people who absolutely do not want to increase
the tipped minimum wage.
They say it will squeeze an already struggling industry.
So now for the side that says we absolutely must change the system.
Saru Jayaraman is the president of an organization called One Fair Wage.
They're pushing for that Raise the Wage Act,
the one we heard about earlier that would kill the minimum wage for tipped workers.
The restaurant industry, Saru says, is paying its workers way too little.
This is the nation's second largest and number one fastest growing private sector employer.
But it's been the absolute lowest paying employer for decades and decades.
OK, brace yourselves.
Get ready for some data.
Here we go.
OK, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
the median hourly wage for servers is $11 an hour.
And that's including tips.
Working full time, that's only about 22 grand a year.
And remember, this is the median, you know, the middle.
So half of workers make even less than that.
Saru says tipped workers are much more likely to be on food stamps
and live in poverty than the rest of the U.S. workforce.
And she says that whole idea that employers are supposed to make up the difference
if workers tips don't get them to $7.25 an hour, great in theory, not so great in practice.
Remember Carolyn, the Olive Garden employee we spoke to earlier?
She said, well, the Olive Garden was pretty good about following that rule.
Her previous employer, another restaurant, was totally not.
When she didn't get enough tips, they did not make up the difference.
And it's a really tough position to be in.
Like, what is Carolyn supposed to do at that point?
The onus is on her to complain.
And who knows how her boss is going to react.
They may decide to assign her all the slow weekday afternoon shifts
where there aren't any customers, take her off their lucrative weekend night shifts.
Carolyn's problem here is not unique.
Some years back, the Department of Labor investigated nearly 9,000 restaurants
and found over a thousand violations where employers failed to make up that difference.
So workers don't have that much power in their relationship with their employers.
And they also don't have much power in their relationship with their customers.
Tipped employees are functionally employed by a bunch of random strangers every night,
which creates all kinds of problems.
One of those problems? Sexual harassment.
If your wages are so reliant on tips, your customers can be just as terrible as they want,
and you have to smile and laugh at their bad jokes and tolerate them if you need their tip money.
Even when they're saying horrifying things.
Even maybe when they're harassing you.
One fair wages research shows that 90% of female restaurant workers
report experiencing sexual harassment on the job.
Another study found that the restaurant industry has the highest rate of workers
reporting sexual harassment of any industry.
Carolyn says she experienced this at Olive Garden.
There are, not just myself, so many other women in the service industry
get so many crude and inappropriate comments said towards them
and you're just kind of like, oh yeah, okay.
Like, just get it over with, okay, now this is awkward.
Right, okay, thank you so much, I'll go get those breadsticks.
Yeah, that's exactly how it is.
And Saru says this system that enables sexual harassment has lasting consequences.
This is the first job for almost one in two Americans.
This is how young women get exposed to the world of work.
This is how they learn what's normal, legal, ethical, acceptable in the workplace.
And that actually increases their tolerance for harassment later in life.
Saru says a higher minimum wage would mean that workers would be less extremely reliant
on the good graces of whatever dirt bag sits at their table.
They wouldn't have to just grin and bear it.
In Saru's world, they would have a $15 an hour paycheck coming their way no matter what.
So they could more easily stand up for themselves or at least get taken off that table.
And again, this system where employees are functionally employed
by a bunch of random strangers, it leads to other problems like racism.
In a study led by Michael Lynn at Cornell University,
white servers got significantly higher tips than black servers.
For instance, for tables of three or more,
they found that black servers on average made 25% less in tips per table.
There is now irrefutable evidence that workers of color get tipped less than white workers
both because of customer bias
and because of employer bias.
They are segregated into more casual restaurants where they earn a lot less in tips.
Last September, One Fair Wage filed a federal complaint against Olive Garden,
actually Olive Garden's parent company, Darden Restaurants,
saying that this system forcing workers to rely on tips results in racial inequality
and that this violates equal protection of the law.
One Fair Wage is targeting Olive Garden's owner, Darden Restaurants,
because it's one of the largest employers of tipped workers in the country.
But also because they've been the primary driving force
within the National Restaurant Association against minimum wage increases.
Oh, it's the National Restaurant Association, the other NRA again.
Since the 90s, they've spent over $50 million on federal lobbying
and millions and millions more in campaign contributions.
They're using a lot of that money to fight against minimum wage increases.
They say the existing system is fine.
Sean, the NRA public affairs executive says
sexual harassment should not be tolerated,
but raising the minimum wage won't do anything to prevent it.
And here's what he said when I asked him about the study from Michael Lin and colleagues
about racial disparities in tips.
It sounds like what he's suggesting is that there is nationwide systemic racism
against African-American employees.
I don't know if you find that you do that.
I certainly don't, and I don't know many people that do.
So Sean doesn't think that raising the minimum wage is going to fix all these problems.
And again, he argues it will be a disaster for both restaurants and all those tipped workers.
But to the main point the NRA makes, that this will be a massive job killer,
that isn't really supported by the evidence we have.
There's actually been a natural experiment going on for decades.
There are seven states that have long had no subminimum wage for tipped workers,
including Montana, Alaska, and California.
They have the same minimum wage for everyone.
Silvia Allegretto is a labor economist at UC Berkeley.
She's compared the restaurant industries in the states
with a low subminimum wage for tipped workers and those without.
And she says the evidence just does not support the National Restaurant Association's argument
that eliminating the subminimum wage for tipped workers
is going to destroy the restaurant industry.
What we show is actually that the restaurant industry from 2011 through 2019
in the states that do not have subminimum wages for tipped workers
grew at a much higher rate than those that did.
So she's saying all those concerns that the NRA, the food NRA,
has raised for decades about minimum wage hikes inevitably leading to job losses and restaurant closures.
In the data we have so far, just the opposite seemed to be happening.
Restaurants were thriving in those states.
The evidence does suggest that higher minimum wages result in slightly higher menu prices,
but workers also earn more and they spend more.
Worker turnover goes down. Productivity increases.
So there are economic benefits too.
Though, to be fair, all of this data, it's pre-pandemic.
Right. COVID has really messed up the restaurant industry
and the bill that Democrats are pushing in Congress,
it would increase the minimum wage in ways we haven't seen before.
I mean, $2.13 to $15 an hour, that's a huge leap.
There is a lot of research that shows that modest increases in the minimum wage
won't kill a significant amount of jobs or substantially increase menu prices,
but something of this magnitude, there's less research on that.
And as for Carolyn, she said to the restaurant industry,
so long and thanks for all the tips,
even if they were often crummy and I had to make endless salads for dirtbag customers.
She's now in training to be an elementary school teacher.
It's actually a non-paid internship.
You have to complete this to be certified and you don't get paid for it.
Her husband has a job which does pay him money,
so they are living on his income right now.
I am definitely looking forward to finishing
and being able to have a teacher's salary
and getting to do what I love and getting paid for it fully
and not depending on, oh, well, what am I going to make today?
I don't know, going in the uncertainty of it all.
