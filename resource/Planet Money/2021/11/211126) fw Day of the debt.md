We make a loan to the U.S. government, and it does not go the way we thought it would. Plus: the story of that one time the U.S. defaulted. Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

The U.S. borrows money constantly. And its reputation as a borrower is rock-solid. If you loan the U.S. government money, you feel very, very sure that you're going to get it back. But what happens when that reliable reputation is called into question, even a little bit?

With a debt ceiling deadline bearing down, we make a loan to the U.S. government. We buy our own tiny slice of government debt. And then something happens that we really didn't see coming. That story, plus the story of a $12 billion mistake.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

A few weeks ago, as part of this story, I was trying to loan the United States government some of my money because apparently the United States government is about to run out of cash - if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling. Now, usually it's gigantic institutional investors, foreign central banks that are lending the U.S. money. But regular people can do this, too. You go to the TreasuryDirect website, where I was somewhat surprised to learn I had apparently created an account years ago. I guessed my username, my password fine. But then I hit my security question, which was, what is my favorite movie?

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

MALONE: Proved to be a bit of a problem.

ART: Treasury Services. My name is Art (ph). How may I help you?

MALONE: Hey. I'm locked out of my account.

ART: OK.

MALONE: I explained to Art that I had guessed "Lord Of The Rings," then "Mad Max: Fury Road," then "Fellowship Of The Ring." And that is when I got locked out.

Now I'm really curious. Like, what is my favorite movie?

(LAUGHTER)

ART: Well, I have other questions. What is the location of your dream vacation?

MALONE: Art starts asking me some other security questions. And look; the reason we're going through all of this is because we figured maybe something interesting will happen if we are actually holding debt as the country heads towards another debt-ceiling deadline - debt that we would be able to hold once I answered these other security questions.

Washington, D.C.

ART: Correct. Yeah.

MALONE: Great.

Finally, Art says he can reveal what it was that I actually listed as my favorite movie.

ART: So going back to the first question, it looks like the favorite movie was "Moonlight."

MALONE: "Moonlight." Oh.

ART: I hope I didn't lock the account here, so you should be able to get back in.

MALONE: Thank you so much. Have you seen "Moonlight"? It's great.

ART: I have not, but I have heard of it, though, so...

MALONE: It's my favorite movie, Art. I don't know if you're aware of that.

ART: (Laughter) I will have to check it out.

MALONE: All right. Thank you so much. Now I can buy some government debt.

ART: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

First came Toxie, the toxic assets, then Delawho, the tax shelter. Today we welcome the newest little member of our PLANET MONEY team, a Treasury bill - name to come. A T-bill is one of the simplest units of government debt. And it can also be, like, this seismograph that detects vibrations in the economy, points out tremors in market confidence.

Today on the show, the PLANET MONEY T-bill experiment. Will we get rich? Will we go broke? No, neither of those things. T-bills are the definition of low risk, low reward - a symbol of how the United States government always pays its debts. Except there was that wild moment in 1979 that we'll talk about, too.

Chapter 1 - Little. That's how the movie "Moonlight" starts - in this case, a little T-bill.

CARDIFF GARCIA, BYLINE: You're going to try to buy, if I'm not mistaken, a Treasury bill.

MALONE: Not try, Cardiff. We're buying government debt.

GARCIA: We're going to do it.

MALONE: Cardiff Garcia, former co-host of PLANET MONEY Indicator, current host of a new podcast called "The New Bazaar" and exactly the kind of nerdy, excitable companion we would need on this mission. So let's start with a little government loans 101. Basically all the time, the U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through taxes. And so it has to borrow lots of money constantly to keep running. It has to issue debt

OK. Can you see my screen?

GARCIA: Yes, I can. You are at the TreasuryDirect website.

MALONE: Great. So these are our debt options here - bills, notes and bonds.

GARCIA: So all of these are different kinds of government debt. But they each expire within different time frames.

MALONE: OK.

Bills, notes and bonds are the three most common ways the government borrows money. If I buy a Treasury note or a bond, that is like giving a longer-term loan to the government - maybe two years, 10 years, 30 years. A Treasury bill is the shortest loan. It is less than a year.

GARCIA: It is just about the single safest investment you can possibly make, with the possible exception of, like, loaning me 10 bucks.

MALONE: You personally, Cardiff Garcia?

GARCIA: Yeah, me, for a salad or something (laughter) - I'm good for it.

MALONE: The T-bill is incredibly low risk because, like all government debt, it is a loan to the United States government - a stable country that gets to tax one of the biggest economies in the world. But because a T-bill in particular is the shortest loan that you can make to the government, it is the least risky kind of government loan. Like, imagine if you were going to lend the government money for, let's say, 30 years. There's economic uncertainty built into that. There's even some teeny chance that the U.S. government falls apart between now and 30 years. But if I loan money to the government for four weeks, like, that's no problem. They are going to pay me back. And so we are going to buy this very unrisky T-bill.

All right - purchase amount.

GARCIA: I think the minimum there, I think, is a hundred bucks, right?

MALONE: A hundred bucks. I feel like that's all I want to loan the government right now.

GARCIA: The government could buy a ticket on Broadway with the amount of money you're lending.

MALONE: Oh, a good seat, a good seat, though.

GARCIA: These days, yeah.

MALONE: By clicking submit - oh, God. I don't want to read this.

GARCIA: That is some small print right there. I certify that I am authorized to perform transactions.

MALONE: Yeah, sure. Fine. Fine. Submit. Submit. Go for it.

GARCIA: Yeah. Go for it - just sending money to the government and seeing what happens. OK - confirmed.

MALONE: Oh, that's it.

GARCIA: Yeah. You're done.

MALONE: So I just bought government debt.

GARCIA: You did. You are scheduled to buy government debt.

MALONE: Yeah. I guess I have preordered. I am expecting a little baby T-bill in the next few days. And in the olden days, I could actually get a certificate. But our T-bill will show up as some digits in my account. What should we name this boring little security?

GARCIA: Name the little T-bill?

MALONE: Yeah.

GARCIA: Yeah. Why don't - we want to capture the safety of it. What's an enveloping blanket of warmth, feeling of security?

MALONE: Weighted blankets, cups of cozy tea. I guess we could also call him Mr. T-bill is also, like, a really...

GARCIA: Mr. T-bill. All right.

MALONE: You know what makes me feel cozy? Knowing that Mr. T would be around.

GARCIA: If you're palling around with Mr. T., you're feeling good.

MALONE: I would feel safe, feel secure. I also feel like Mr. T is is always good for a few bucks since he's always wearing a bunch of gold.

GARCIA: Mr. T-bill. All right.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "THE A-TEAM")

MR T: (As B.A. Baracus) I want to go up there, grab this dude by his heels, shake him upside down and shake all the money out his pockets that he owe these people.

MALONE: So safe, so secure. In fact, Mr. T-bill is arguably the safest investment on earth. I am loaning the minimum allowable amount of money to one of the most reliable borrowers in the world. And I have chosen to lend that money for the shortest amount of time possible, just four weeks. I am 0% worried that the U.S. government will pay me back with interest. How much interest? Well, Cardiff pulls up a chart of the going interest rates for T-bills.

GARCIA: Oh, yeah. You're likely to get something along the lines of, like, .05%, I think, is what you...

MALONE: Point zero - so is that...

GARCIA: Point.. I think it's, like...

MALONE: Five cents.

GARCIA: Not even because you would only get 5 cents if you invested for a whole year straight. So for just this four-week T-bill, you would actually just get less than one half of a cent, actually. In fact, let me put it this way. If you were to round to the nearest cent, you would be rounding to zero.

MALONE: OK. OK. That's bad.

GARCIA: I don't know of anything that would pay you less. But, again, Kenny, that makes perfect sense, right? You're not supposed to be able to make more money than this because the government, again, is the safest place where you can invest your money. And you're barely doing it for any amount of time. I mean, you're just giving the government money for a few weeks, and then you're going to get it back. And when you know they're good for it, why would they offer a higher rate than that?

MALONE: And this is a huge deal. It is one of the great privileges of being the United States government. It can borrow money for almost nothing, and that makes it much much cheaper if the government needs to borrow money for, say, you know, a giant pandemic or to fix crumbling infrastructure or whatever. Now, one of the keys to this superpower is trust. The U.S. has a rock-solid reputation for paying its debts.

But this is where the debt ceiling comes in. In 2011, the Standard & Poor's rating agency - S&P - downgraded the U.S. debt for the first time in history in large part because the debt ceiling has become this political game. So, for example, if the U.S. doesn't raise the debt ceiling in the next few weeks and borrow more money, then there is a chance it won't be able to pay back its existing lenders like me or, I, guess me once Mr. T-bill actually arrives. But, like, look. It has never gotten to that point with these super-safe T-bill. In modern history, the United States has never ever defaulted.

DICK MARCUS: When you say the government never ever defaulted, that's not exactly correct.

MALONE: Finance professor Richard Marcus.

MARCUS: Yeah. Call me Dick Marcus. I've been at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee in the Lubar School of Business since 1985.

MALONE: We called Dick because there is a valuable lesson in this one time in modern history the government did technically default on our T-bills. And Dick is the expert on this story of what is a somewhat entertaining mess. Now, the first thing you need to know is that today the Treasury pays back its debts electronically. This was not, however, the case back when Dick's story takes place, 1979.

MARCUS: At the time, the Treasury was mailing checks to people.

MALONE: But it is like just, like, breathing for the Treasury, right? It just - these checks go out, like, I assume - what? - tens of thousands of these things are...

MARCUS: Yes. It would be like sending out the bill from Sears or something. You just knew when it was going to be mailed out.

MALONE: But in the spring of 1979, there were some troubles. Similar to today, actually, Congress had waited to the last second to raise the debt ceiling, which meant that time was tight for the Treasury to send out checks. And then apparently the Treasury also had some kinds of, like, word processing problems.

MARCUS: The fact that the word processing machines weren't working - that, it's hard to understand. You know, sometimes a machine in your house doesn't work. And, oh, my gosh, it's not working. What am I going to do?

MALONE: Did they try unplugging it and plugging it back in, do we know?

MARCUS: (Laughter) Reboot, reboot. Yes.

MALONE: Now, a bunch of T-bills were scheduled to be paid back on April 26. That day comes, no checks. A bunch more T-bills come due next week, no checks. More the next week, no checks. Now, imagine you were on the other end of that.

MARCUS: I expect that I'm going to be receiving a check for my T-bill, but I didn't get it.

MALONE: And so are investors rioting in the streets? Are they burning cars? Are they flipping out?

MARCUS: Oh, no. There wasn't any demonstration. There was frowning by the people that didn't get their money on time.

MALONE: Frowning, frowning.

MARCUS: And, of course, others that have Treasury bills coming due later in the year start to get nervous as well.

MALONE: And they riot and burn cars in the streets.

MARCUS: No, no, no.

MALONE: But still, by missing those three payments in the spring of 1979, Dick says the U.S. government did in that moment technically default.

MARCUS: From a technical point of view, at least about $122 million worth of Treasury bills went unpaid.

MALONE: A hundred and twenty-two million dollars.

MARCUS: Yes.

MALONE: The U.S. eventually paid everyone back with interest and even settled a lawsuit it maybe didn't need to because at stake here was the government's reputation as a borrower. And sure, this was a tiny, like, technically it was a default but was it really kind of default? But Dick and a colleague realized that this was the perfect moment to see what happens when the U.S.' reliability is called into question even just that teeny bit.

To understand what they found, you have to know that when the government borrows money, it does not set the rates. Like, lenders do. They say, OK, U.S. government, I feel very sure you're gonna pay me back. And so I'll lend you money at this relatively low rate. But then the word processing mix up happened. Checks temporarily didn't get sent. Dick and his colleague found that for six months after that mistake, the U.S. had to pay about point .6% more to borrow money, which may not sound like a big bump, but it added up.

MARCUS: It was about $12 billion at the time. It was a significant impact.

MALONE: So potential lenders are saying, oh, I don't know about this U.S. government. They might default. But they're saying it in the smallest, like, teeny mouse voice ever. They're not asking that much more money, but they are a little more worried.

MARCUS: Yes, I think that's what we would imply. And so we would wish that the Federal Reserve and our Treasury would avoid these kinds of issues in the future.

GARCIA: If some late checks can functionally wind up costing the United States $12 billion, then the lesson I take away is that if you introduce even the teeniest doubt that the U.S. is rock solid on paying back debt on time, it can become a big problem. After the break, we get our piece of the national debt. We finally get our T-bill, the least risky, most boring investment we can imagine, and it ends up surprising us.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: At 11:30 in the morning on Thursday, November 18, 2021...

(SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING)

MALONE: ...Our Mr. T-bill was born.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: But I pity the fool.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: His first words.

MALONE: Now, it is useful to know that government debt does not just appear like magic. There is a whole process to this. And here's how it worked for Mr. T-bill. On that day, November 18, the Treasury functionally created a bunch of T-bills - $10 billion worth. Our T-bill is just $100 of that, but it has the same characteristics as all its, like, siblings or whatever. Mr. T will take four weeks to reach full maturity. That will occur precisely on December 21, 2021. And that is when the government has to pay me back. What is not set, though, is how much interest the government has to pay me. That is the critical piece of information that we get to find out on Mr. T-bill's birthday.

GARCIA: Check, check, level check.

MALONE: You sound good.

GARCIA: Oh. You know what?

MALONE: I called Cardiff Garcia to share this big reveal.

It feels like we're about to get the vitals, like the weight, the head size.

GARCIA: Yes. And we are committed to loving it no matter what.

MALONE: Right.

As we mentioned, the Treasury does not set the interest rates for government debt. What actually happens is it holds an auction where all these huge financial institutions place bids. They assess the risk, and then they say, we'll loan you money, America. But you have to pay us at this rate. So the day our T-bill's rate was being set, I just kept refreshing the Treasury's website all day, waiting for these results for that interest rate.

GARCIA: This is...

MALONE: Boom. Here it is.

GARCIA: This is it.

MALONE: This is Little Mr. T-bill. All right. So...

GARCIA: Yeah. So the interest rate as shown here is .11%.

MALONE: That's - am I wrong that this is, like, double what we thought it might be?

GARCIA: Yeah. That is not what we expected.

MALONE: No.

GARCIA: We had said that it would be about .05% because that is what was being reported by the Treasury Department as the current rate on four-week T-bills. So this is double. And I wonder if what this suggests is that there's a little bit of nervousness about the upcoming debt ceiling...

MALONE: Oh.

GARCIA: ...Deadline. It's possible.

MALONE: Because Mr. T-bill reaches his maturity in the middle of what might be another debt ceiling standoff.

GARCIA: Yeah. Yeah. How about that?

MALONE: Our T-bill reaches maturity on December 21. That is when the government has to pay me back. Our Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that the government could run out of cash by December 15, six days before the government has to pay me for our T-bill. So what Cardiff is saying - and the Department of the Treasury confirmed this to me - is that lenders appear to be just the tiniest bit worried. They seem to think there is a minutely increased chance of something going wrong with the debt ceiling, which could mess up debt payments and specifically mess up the debt payments for the December 21 T-bill, our T-bill.

And we can see this in a kind of amazing way. There is, like, a cousin of our T-bill that comes due a full month later. It's a longer-term T-bill, which is usually higher-risk. But the market thinks it is less risky. It set the rate on that longer T-bill at .05%, which is that same laughably low rate that we were expecting for our T-bill.

GARCIA: Yeah. And so what you can plausibly infer from this is that there is a worry that there might be some kind of a debt ceiling standoff or some kind of confusion in the markets about the debt ceiling in December but that by the time the eight-week Treasury matures, it'll be fixed. And you'll definitely get your payout on the eight-week.

MALONE: Back to the pencil shavings worth of interest.

GARCIA: Yes. I mean, they're both pencil shavings...

MALONE: Oh.

GARCIA: ...Worth of interest. And...

MALONE: I get...

GARCIA: We should...

MALONE: ...Twice as much pencil shavings.

GARCIA: It rounds up to a penny is what I would say.

MALONE: Yeah, yeah.

GARCIA: It rounds up to a penny.

MALONE: From my perspective, this has worked out great. I'm getting double the interest I was expecting. It'll round up to, like, a whole penny instead of rounding down to zero pennies. But from the U.S. government's perspective, this is not so great. With these uncertainties around the debt ceiling, they have to pay twice as much to me and everyone else who loaned them money for this December 21 T-bill.

You know, Cardiff, part of this story was about buying the boringest (ph) of the boring of the boring assets.

GARCIA: Yes.

MALONE: And it ended up being...

GARCIA: Yes. That is...

MALONE: ...Twice as interesting as we thought.

GARCIA: Exactly right. What I would say is that boringness is important. Boringness is useful. Boringness is good, OK? You don't want a financial system that's spiking around all over the place, fluctuating. And so the U.S. offering the world this exceptionally boring security is a good thing. It anchors the rest of the global financial system, which is why even the smallest threat to treasuries is a risk that we really shouldn't be running. It's a dumb thing to be doing. So that is the only point I would make about things being boring. Boring is not bad. Boring is awesome.

MALONE: Mr. T-bill was designed to be our shortest, least dramatic PLANET MONEY project. And there really are only two outcomes here. What will almost certainly happen is that next month Congress will raise the debt ceiling. The government will have plenty of money to pay me when Mr. T-bill reaches his ripe old age of 28 days. And that will be the end of our Mr. T-bill experiment. But on that infinitesimally small chance that things do go wrong and December 21 comes and goes with no virtual check in my treasury account, investors will be more than frowning, I suspect. And we will definitely keep doing stories about our T-bill.

So for example, if the US doesn't raise the debt ceiling in the next few weeks and borrow more money
Then there is a chance it won't be able to pay back its existing lenders like me or I guess me once mr
T bill actually arrives, but but like look it has never gotten to that point with the super
Safe T bill in modern history. The United States has never ever
Defaulted when you say the government never ever defaulted
That's not exactly correct finance professor Richard Marcus. Yeah, call me dick Marcus
I've been at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee and the Lubar School of Business since 1985
We called dick because there is a valuable lesson in this one time in modern history
The government did technically default on our T bills and dick is the expert on this story of what is a somewhat entertaining mess
Now the first thing you need to know is that today the Treasury pays back its debts electronically
This was not however the case back when dick story takes place
1979 at the time the Treasury was mailing checks to people
But it is like just like breathing for the Treasury right?
Just these checks go out like I assume what tens of thousands of these things
Yes, it would be like sending out the bill from Sears or something
You just knew when it was going to be mailed out. But in the spring of
1979 there were some troubles similar to today actually
Congress had waited to the last second to raise the debt ceiling which meant that time was tight for the Treasury to send
Out checks and then apparently the Treasury also had some kinds of like word processing problems
The fact that the word processing machines weren't working. I have that it's hard to understand
You know, sometimes a machine in your house doesn't work and oh my gosh, it's not working
What am I gonna do? Did they try unplugging it and plugging it back in?
Reboot reboot. Yes now a bunch of T bills were scheduled to be paid back on April 26th
That day comes
No checks a bunch more T bills come due next week. No checks more the next week
No checks now imagine you are on the other end of that
I expect that I'm going to be receiving a check for my t-bill, but I didn't get it
And so our investors
Riding in the streets. Are they are they burning cars? Are they flipping out? Oh, no, there wasn't any demonstration there was
Frowning by by the people that didn't get their money on time
Frowning frowning and of course others that have Treasury bills
Coming to later in the year start to get nervous as well and they riot and burn
But still by by missing those three payments in the spring of
1979 Dick says the US government did in that moment technically default from a technical point of view
At least about a hundred and twenty two million dollars worth of Treasury bills went unpaid
122 million dollars. Yes, the US eventually paid everyone back with interest and and even settled a lawsuit
It maybe didn't need to because at stake here was the government's reputation as a borrower and sure
This was a tiny like technically it was a default
But was it really kind of default but
Dick and a colleague realized that this was the perfect moment to see what happens when the US is
Reliability is called into question even just that teeny bit
To understand what they found you have to know that that when the government borrows money
It does not set the rates like lenders do they say okay US government
I feel very sure you're gonna pay me back and so I'll lend you money at this is relatively low rate
But then the word processing mix-up happened checks temporarily didn't get sent
Dick and his colleague found that for six months after that mistake the US had to pay about
0.6 percent more to borrow money, which which may not sound like a big bump, but it added up
It was about 12 billion dollars at the time. It was a
significant
Impact so potential lenders are saying oh, I don't know about this US government
They might default but they're saying it in the smallest like teeny mouse a voice ever
They're not asking that much more money, but they are a little more worried. Yes
I think that's what we would imply and so
We would wish
That the Federal Reserve and our Treasury would avoid these kinds of issues in the future
If some late checks can functionally wind up costing the United States 12 billion dollars
Then the lesson I take away is that if you introduce even the teeniest doubt that the US is rock-solid
On paying back debt on time. It can become a big problem
After the break we get our piece of the national debt
We finally get our t-bill the least risky most boring investment we can imagine and it ends up surprising us
At 1130 in the morning on
Thursday November 18th
1021
Our mr. T bill was born
Now it is useful to know the government debt does not just appear like magic there
There's a whole process to this and here's how it worked for mr. T bill on that day November 18th the Treasury
Functionally created a bunch of t bills ten billion dollars worth our t bill is just a hundred dollars of that
But it has the same characteristics as all its like siblings or whatever
Mr. T will take four weeks to reach full maturity that will occur precisely on December 21st
2021 and that is when the government has to pay me back
What is not set though is how much interest the government has to pay me?
That is the critical piece of information that we get to find out on mr
T bills birthday check check level check you sound good
I called Cardiff Garcia to share this big reveal
It feels it feels like we're we're about to get the vitals like like the weight the the head size
Yes
And we are committed to loving it no matter what right as we mentioned the Treasury does not set the interest rates for government
Debt what actually happens is it holds an auction where all these huge financial institutions place bids
They assess the risk and then they say we'll loan you money America, but but you have to pay us this rate
So the day our t bills rate was being set
I just kept like refreshing the Treasury's website all day waiting for these results for that that interest rate
This is boom. Here it is. This is it. This is little mr. T bill. All right, so yeah
so the interest rate as shown here is
point one one percent
That's am I wrong that this is like double what we thought it might be
Yeah, that is not what we expected
we'd said that it would be about point zero five percent because that is what was being reported by the
Treasury department as the current rate on four-week t bills
so this is double and I wonder if what this suggests is that there's a little bit of nervousness about
the upcoming
debt ceiling
Deadline it's possible because mr. T bill reaches his maturity
In the middle of what might be another debt ceiling stand. Yeah. Yeah, how about that?
Our t bill reaches maturity on December 21st
That is when the government has to pay me back our Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen has said that the government could run out of cash by December 15th
Six days before the government has to pay me for our t bill
So what Cardiff is saying and the Department of the Treasury confirmed this to me is that lenders appear to be just the
tiniest bit worried they seem to think there is a
minutely increased chance of something going wrong with the debt ceiling which could mess up debt payments and
Specifically mess up the debt payments for the December 21st t bill our t bill and we can see this in a kind of
Amazing way there is like a cousin of our t bill that comes due a full month later
It's a longer term t bill which is usually higher risk
But the market thinks it is less risky it set the rate on that longer t bill at point oh five percent
Which is that same laughably low rate that we were expecting for our t bill. Yeah, and so what you can
plausibly
Infer from this is that there's a worry that there might be some kind of a debt ceiling standoff or some kind of
Confusion in the markets about the debt ceiling in December
But that by the time the eight-week
Treasury matures it'll be fixed and you'll definitely get your payout on the eight-week back to the the pencil
Shaving's worth of interest. Yes. I mean, they're both pencil
interest and we should
Pencil shavings it rounds up to a penny is what I say. Yeah, is it rounds up to a penny
From my perspective this has worked out great. I'm getting double the interest
I was expecting it'll round up to like a whole penny instead of rounding down to zero pennies
But from the US government's perspective, this is not so great with these uncertainties around the debt ceiling
They have to pay twice as much to me and and everyone else who loaned them money for this December 21st
T bill, you know Cardiff part of this story was about buying the
Boringest of the boring of the boring assets. Yes, and it is that is twice as interesting as we thought
Exactly, right. What I would say is that boringness is important boringness is useful boringness is good
Okay, you don't want a financial system that's spiking around all over the place
Fluctuating and so the US offering the world this exceptionally boring security is a good thing
It anchors the rest of the global financial system
Which is why even the smallest threat to treasuries is
Risk that we really shouldn't be running. It's a dumb thing to be doing
So I that that is the only point I would make about things being boring boring is not bad
Boring is awesome. Mr. T Bill was designed to be our shortest least dramatic
Planet money project and there really are only two outcomes here
What will almost certainly happen is that next month?
Congress will raise the debt ceiling the government will have plenty of money to pay me when mr
T bill reaches his ripe old age of 28 days and that will be the end of our mr. T bill experiment
but on that
infinitesimally small chance that things do go wrong and December 21st comes and goes with no virtual check in my treasury account
Investors will be more than frowning. I suspect and we will definitely keep doing stories about our TV
If you have ideas for what we should do with mr. T bill, let us know his his time is ticking
