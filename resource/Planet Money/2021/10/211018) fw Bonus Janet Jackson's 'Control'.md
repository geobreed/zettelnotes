On the 35th anniversary of Janet Jackson's first No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit, our friends at It's Been A Minute look back at Control, her career-defining album that changed the trajectory of pop music in the late '80s and '90s.



Thirty-five years ago, Janet Jackson released an album that changed the course of her career, and of pop music.
Blake Cale for NPR

Thirty-five years ago, Janet Jackson released an album that changed the course of her career, and of pop music. Control took over radio, reinvented the playbook for Black artists crossing over into pop and ushered in a whole new sound for R&B. For more than a decade after, Jackson released hit after hit and No. 1 album after No. 1 album, alongside her production and writing partners Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

Jackson's influence is still evident throughout pop music: the way stars choreograph their videos, their vocal intonations, their visual presentation, the very ways in which they navigate celebrity. But today, she's rarely considered at the level of her musical peers from the '80s and '90s, such as Prince, Madonna and her brother Michael. And the moral uproar that followed her performance at the Super Bowl in 2004 showed all the ways popular culture can erase Black women and their accomplishments. Now, as society reconsiders the ways it has treated celebrities like Britney Spears, our friends at It's Been A Minute reconsider Janet Jackson and her body of work — with help from Jam and Lewis themselves, as well as music journalist Danyel Smith.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Hey there, listeners.
Today we have a special episode from our friends
over at NPR's It's Been a Minute podcast.
35 years ago, Janet Jackson released her album Control,
an album that helped redefine pop music.
It was her first big commercial hit,
and she became one of the biggest stars
of the late 80s and early 90s,
right up there with her brother Michael and with Madonna.
And yet, Janet Jackson is not always given her due.
In this episode, host Sam Sanders explores why that is,
how she made the album Control,
and the incident that lasted all but a second
that changed the course of her career.
You probably know the one.
Okay, here is the episode.
Enjoy.
What is your first Janet Jackson memory?
It's a wild thing to ask me
my first Janet Jackson memory
because Janet and I are like the same age.
Oh, wow.
This is music journalist Danielle Smith.
You know, it's a wonderful memory.
So for my eighth birthday,
my mother got me tickets to see the Jackson Five
live in concert at the Circle Star Theater
in San Carlos, California.
And when we got to the Circle Star Theater,
there was an opening act.
And that opening act was Randy Jackson
and Janet Jackson.
Here's Janet and Randy.
Or Randy and Janet, I don't know what you want.
Wow, and she's at this point around your age,
which is around eight?
Yeah, she was like seven or eight.
Yep, absolutely. Oh, my goodness.
How was she in that opening act performance?
Well, the thing is they weren't even singing.
They were like doing skits.
Okay, Janet, now that you're up here,
what do you wanna do?
Like vaudeville.
They were doing, they had jokes.
You can't do that.
Everybody works in this family.
Then let's play a team.
And one of the jokes was,
and Janet is kind of known for this.
You can find the shots of her dressed up
kind of like Mae West
and doing Mae West impressions.
That's the one.
Cause she has those two little buns on her head
and the feather boa.
And she's swinging those hips
and sassing everybody at like eight, nine or 10 years old.
Yes, and so picture me in the audience screaming
and yelling like a fool.
Because my thought was,
you have to understand, there was no social media.
There weren't that many like fan magazines
or black magazines for me to know
that there even was a little sister
to the Jackson five.
So I was screaming in holla.
I was so happy to know about her.
You're listening to It's Been A Minute from NPR.
I'm Sam Sanders.
And this episode,
Janet,
Miss Jackson.
It is hard to describe how much Janet Jackson means to me.
I can recall the exact place I was
the first time I saw several of her music videos.
I remember trying to teach myself the choreography
from her pleasure principle video
and almost being seriously injured in the process.
I remember thinking that I would never hear
a better song in my entire life
than love will never do without you.
I was right.
And you know, when it comes to the Janet fandom,
I am not alone.
Janet Jackson means a lot to a lot of people.
So much of what she did in the eighties
and the nineties and beyond,
it laid the groundwork for so much that we see
and hear now.
Britney and Beyonce
and even Taylor Swift,
their styles and their approaches to the industry itself.
It was all influenced by Janet Jackson.
There is not a successful artist in pop today
who isn't a descendant of the legacy of Janet.
As we've heard already,
she began early with the Jackson Five.
From there,
Janet had a starring role on the sitcom, Good Times.
Malona.
Penny.
I'm here to stay.
A recurring role on Different Strokes.
He sort of forbid me to see you anymore.
What did he say?
I forbid you to see him anymore.
She was cast in the TV show, Fame.
Someday you gonna come running after me.
And then she also had a music career.
Janet released two albums,
the self-titled Janet Jackson and Dream Street,
all by the time she was 18.
And I'm gonna be honest here.
Those two albums,
they were flops.
It wasn't until Janet's third album
that the world finally turned its head
and took notice.
This is a story about control.
When everything changed with control.
Control of what I say,
control of what I do.
So 35 years ago, this year,
Janet blessed us with this iconic album.
Today we're talking about the legacy of Janet Jackson
and how that album, Control,
it didn't just redefine her career.
It really redefined all of pop music that came after it.
For me, Control is one of those albums
that you get maybe once in a generation.
Singularly focused and so cohesive.
And yet every song has a personality of its own.
It had songwriting that pushed the envelope,
but also felt immediately familiar.
It was music that critics and mainstream radio alike
had to love.
It also gave a big lesson in crossover success.
And that is a topic that we've been discussing
in this music series we're doing.
You know, Control was insanely popular
with both white and black audiences
and all different kinds of radio formats.
Of course, Janet Jackson did not make Control by herself.
In 1985, she met up with two producers
who would help her shape the sound of contemporary R&B
for years to come.
And then we were supposed to start working
with another artist and the artist decided
that she didn't want to work with us.
This is Terry Lewis.
So John McClain called us and said,
he was the A&R person.
He said, you know, who do you guys want to produce
on our roster?
And he sent the roster because at that time
there was no fax machine and there was no email.
So we got a roster in the mail.
We both looked at it and said, Janet.
So we called him and said, we'd like to produce Janet.
Coming up, producers and songwriters,
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and how they helped
make one of the better pop albums of our time.

Before Control, Janet Jackson was doing mostly bubblegum pop.
But producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,
they saw something more.
We've always kind of gone off people that inspire you.
Certain people can be talented,
but they don't necessarily inspire you
to want to write songs for them.
This is Jimmy Jam.
And in Janet's case, it was a simple thing
for us.
We both felt we could write really great songs for her.
She inspired that.
We thought she had a beautiful voice, first of all.
But what we thought was we missed, when she was young,
she had all this attitude.
She was like, she was like Miss Attitude.
Why don't you come up and sing me some time?
What's wrong with now?
Remember the buns in her hair?
The feather boa?
The Mae West impressions?
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis remembered all of that.
We felt the records that she had done,
they were quality records with quality producers.
But the thing that we were missing on those records
was where was that attitude?
And so our thought was if we could work with her,
we could bring a little bit of that attitude out.
So at 19 years old, Janet moved to Minneapolis
to begin working with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
She was finally taking control of her career.
Take me back to the first studio session
y'all have with Janet in Minneapolis.
What's it like?
What is her vibe?
What is the vibe?
What do you recall from that first session?
Well, really the first sessions
were not recording sessions.
They were more therapy sessions,
I guess I would call them.
We spent a lot of time just hanging out together.
We would go to movies, we would hang out at clubs,
we would ride around the lakes and just kind of hang out.
And then we'd have discussions.
And our discussions were
not that we were trying to analyze her,
but we were just trying to get to know her better
and know what was important to her
and what she wanted to talk about,
what she wanted to sing about.
And after about a week of just kind of
hanging out doing that,
Janet said, well, when are we going to start working?
And we said, oh, we're working.
And we showed her the lyrics to Control.
Wait, stop it, stop, stop, pause.
So y'all, while you're just chilling with Janet,
going to the movies and driving around the lakes,
you're actually like studying her
and writing your first song for her in the process.
Yeah, and that's something we,
we always kind of did that with the artists,
but probably not quite as intense we did with Janet
because a lot of the artists we had worked with before
there was a little more, I don't know,
history or things we could study
so we knew a little bit more about them.
But we would always do that
before we would write for an artist
because we always wanted to tailor-make
the songs specifically for them.
So back in the day, we always used to say,
you know, if an artist likes McDonald's,
I don't want to start writing a song about Burger King.
Because what happens is the artists
for the rest of their lives,
if you have a hit record,
the artist has to sing that for the rest of their lives.
We want them to have things.
Make it fit them.
Yeah, make it fit.
So that's the way we looked at it.
So then what kind of stuff was Janet sharing with y'all
that made y'all want to write a song
as strong and powerful as Control?
Well, mainly that she was just taking control
of her life.
She was moving out of her house.
She was, you know, ready to become,
you know, to go out on her own.
And also the other piece to the puzzle here
was that she was really ready to sing.
The first two albums that she did,
she did between a lot of other things.
And the idea of her singing wasn't really her idea,
it was more her dad's idea.
So while she could sing,
it's like when you have a talent
and somebody goes, oh, you're really good at that.
You should do that.
And you're kind of like, yeah,
but it's not really what I want to do.
I think that was Janet's attitude
the first couple of records.
She sang because she could,
not because she wanted to or that she needed to.
When we got around to Control,
she was in a space where
she actually wanted to be an artist.
So the work that she was willing to put into it
and the fact that then when she got so excited
when we showed her some of the Control lyrics
and she said,
well, wait a minute,
this is what we've been talking about.
And we said, yeah.
And she said,
so whatever we talk about,
that's what we're going to write about?
And we said, yeah.
And she said, oh, then I want to talk about this
and I want to talk about this.
And it totally opened her up at that point.
And so then she became not only Janet the singer,
she went from being Janet the reluctant singer
to Janet, I want to sing
to now here's what I want to sing about.
But nobody had asked her.
Well, I am so glad that y'all asked her
what she wanted to do
because the result stands the test of time.
What kind of singer was Janet Jackson like
in the studio?
Fearless.
Yeah.
There's a couple of words that describe her.
If I had to break it down into simple words,
yeah, like Jam said,
fearless, relentless,
beautiful, like a beautiful texture
and very in control.
There's something I want to tell you.
A lot of people say that Janet's not a great singer
but Janet is a great singer.
But in order to be a great singer,
you don't have to be the loudest singer.
You just have to have control of what you like to do.
And to me, style wins over violence.
There you go.
I always loved and you hear it
in lots of songs that she would do.
She was able to convey emotion,
not just through the singing.
There's so many Janet, classic Janet songs
where like her laugh conveys so much
or a sigh conveys so much
or a little quip in the intro for a song conveys so much.
Like you hear some of that acting training
in the other things she's doing on y'all's records
besides the singing.
She just knows how to convey emotion.
Yeah, I totally agree.
And that's, but that's the things,
those little elements, the breaths, the sighs,
the laughs, those things she would always do
and we would just leave them in there.
A lot of times it was a mistake.
Like the, oh, sure.
Like the laugh on, I'm trying to,
oh, when I think of you.
Wait, really?
I love that laugh.
Yeah, but that's just like,
for most people I think that would have been an outtake.
And for us, all the things that were outtakes
were always the pieces
that we always tried to make sure was in there
because that was the personality of her.
And if it was a happy song and she was laughing
about it, then we wanted people to feel that
when they were listening to the song.
And even in our production technique,
we would say to her, if she was singing a song like that,
a lot of times we wouldn't be looking at her
because the lights would all be out in the studio.
But I would say, are you smiling?
Because this is a happy song.
You gotta smile when you sing this song.
And she'd go, oh, okay, okay.
And you could tell the difference
because when you're smiling,
even when you're talking to somebody,
when you're smiling as you're talking to them
it's a different thing.
So little things like that, little nuances like that
we thought was really important.
And also about her sighs and her breaths that she takes.
One of the things she shared with Michael
was that rhythmic breathing, I call it,
where her breath before she starts singing is on a beat.
And when she sings, even the way she ends her sentences
when she sang, it wasn't like she would hit
the last word, she'd hit the last word
but then there'd be like a little.
Those are the things that we loved
because those became literally part
of the funkiness of the songs.
And so we were very aware of that
and we loved that about her.
Wow, y'all can't see me right now
but I'm geeking out so hard getting this inside baseball.
It's just incredible to me.
Incredible, oh, all right.
So I wanna talk more about When I Think of You
because that is the song from Control
that becomes I believe her first number one hit
on the Billboard 100.
And I have replayed that video so much.
I was watching again yesterday
and I was like, I've watched that video a few times.
And what I noticed most about that song
and that video besides the video being done
in almost just one single shot,
it's very much a bubblegum pop song
with bubblegum pop visuals and it sounds
and it looks like it is supposed to be a crossover.
Like it's supposed to be played on white radio
and black radio just the same.
And I'm wondering with that song
and even with the album Control,
success in different formats
and with folks from all kinds of backgrounds.
Because this song, it really seems like
it was made for that.
I would say, no, we weren't thinking about that.
What we were thinking about,
I'll tell you what we were thinking about
was we wanted the album.
Okay, so when we were living in LA,
we were living in a neighborhood
that we will say that it's not like the,
well, most people would say not the best neighborhood.
And what we loved about that area
because growing up in Minneapolis,
first of all, we grew up in a very white town.
And so we were very aware.
I mean, I grew up listening to nothing but pop music
pretty much growing up.
So I guess we had the sensibility about what it was,
but with Janet's record,
we were trying to make the record
that when we would walk down the streets
of that neighborhood,
there would be music blasting out of everybody's house.
And with Control, we said,
we want our album to be that album
that everybody's blasting out their house
in that neighborhood.
So we were going for the blackest,
funkiest album we could make
without any consideration of trying to cross over
or anything like that.
Despite not intending for Control to cross over,
it did, and then some.
Control was Janet's first commercial hit.
Five of the songs on that album
became top five hits on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.
And when I think of you, it hit number one.
Terry mentioned his name earlier.
I'll mention his name again, John McClain,
who was the A&R person,
who was the one that hooked us up with Janet.
He was the one that sent us the list of
who do you want to work with at A&M?
And I remember he was the person as we,
when he heard Control, when we were done with it,
he was the one that said,
this is double platinum.
And we're like going, no.
I mean, we're thinking,
yeah, maybe we'll go gold with it.
That'd be great.
He said it's double platinum.
And then he went back to A&M and told everybody that.
Really?
Like, I mean, the stories were
he would literally jump on people's desks,
like literally, and go, you don't know what this is.
This is a double platinum record.
He had everybody so hyped
but intimidated at the same time,
like, oh, shoot, we better go get this record.
Control went on to sell five million copies in the U.S.
and millions more globally.
It spent more than 90 weeks on the Billboard charts.
This album also earned multiple Grammy nominations,
including one for Album of the Year.
Control, Johnny Jackson,
album producers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
And we cannot forget the music videos.
Pleasure Principle, Nasty, When I Think of You,
they are all peak culture with a capital C.
If you go back and watch those videos right now,
you can see that some of those moves,
the kids are still doing them today
in their music videos today.
So after Control,
Janet released another hit album, Rhythm Nation.
That album went platinum six times.
When the Rhythm Nation tour was announced,
it sold out arenas in minutes.
In 1991, Ebony Magazine named Janet and Michael,
quote, the biggest brother-sister stars
in show business history.
I think those albums ended up changing
the way that music sounded
because it changed the way the radio sounded.
And so I think the influence later on,
not only the album,
but the visuals that went with the albums
affected the way pop music,
what pop music became.
I mean, all the great pop music came out of Sweden
at a certain point.
You had Max Martin,
you had from everywhere from Backstreet Boys
to Britney Spears to all of those records.
And they were all to me based on
what Control and what Rhythm Nation was.
And if you talk to them, they will tell you.
I mean, Max Martin,
we went to the Songwriters Hall of Fame
the same year he did.
And he said, hey man,
when we were making those records,
we were just basically trying to do
what you guys were doing.
In the 90s,
Janet Jackson just kept going.
In 93, she had another hit
with a song that seemed to be everywhere for months.
Like a moth to a flame burned by the fire.
It was a lead single from her self-titled album,
a little ditty called That's the Way Love Goes.
That's the Way Love Goes was number one
on the Billboard charts for eight weeks.
But Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis,
they told me at first,
Janet didn't like the song.
Her dancers had to convince her
that it could be a hit.
And what happened was is very much
what happened in the video,
which was she put the cassette on
of the tracks we were working on.
And when that track came on,
she was with all her dancers
and all her friends.
And in the video, one of them is J-Lo.
Yeah, exactly, exactly.
But she was with all her friends on vacation.
They were in Anguilla, as a matter of fact.
And she said when that song came on,
everybody was just like,
oh, what is that?
That's the one right there.
And so it made her hear it differently
because of the way her friends and dancers
were hearing it.
And when she got back, that was the song.
I think we all realize, one,
that she was here to stay.
Again, music journalist Danielle Smith.
That there was no
flash in the pan thing happening with her.
That she was committed to the look.
She was committed to the music.
She was committed to the work,
to the choreography, to everything.
So Janet was now in the same league
as her brother, Michael, and Madonna.
And in some ways, Tina Turner.
Please come forward.
But then,
Congratulations and welcome to Super Bowl 38.
The Super Bowl happened.
Carolina has been designated the visiting team today,
so they will call the...
I mean, to me, the way I remember it is,
it was violent.
Coming up, we go back to that moment in 2004
and why it looks and feels so different
in today's Rearview Mirror.
Justice for Janet after the break.
I think it's hard
to like
talk about her omnipresence.
I remember that video for That's the Way Love Goes.
I felt like it was played on MTV every five minutes.
You could not turn on your radio
on any kind of station and not hear that song.
She was on the cover of all the magazines.
When you compare what she was doing in that moment
and how everywhere she was to, I don't know,
a Taylor Swift or a Beyonce today,
how does it compare?
The level.
I mean, you can compare it,
but then my thing is, can you?
Because the thing is,
that's something that I,
because I've interviewed Janet any number of times,
and in one of our conversations,
she just acknowledged the fact
that she kind of created herself.
I think that Beyonce would be the first person to say
that without the influence of,
yes, definitely Tina Turner,
I always want to add Donna Summer
when I think about Beyonce,
but if there was not a Janet Jackson,
especially with regard to singing
and dancing at the same time,
Beyonce pulls from all of that.
Oh, yeah.
And then Taylor, with regard to just being everywhere
and singing the feelings of youth at that moment,
like when I think about my niece's relationship
to Taylor Swift and how my niece had to tell me,
again, I get the age of nine or 10,
that if I was going to understand my job,
excuse you, Parker Drew Williams,
that I needed to listen to Taylor
to understand her generation.
Yeah.
I mean, there are just many of us that say,
if you want to understand,
especially black women and really just women,
to understand what it felt like to be in love,
to come into your own as a 20-year-old,
a 25-year-old,
because Janet takes us on all the beats.
Yeah, yeah.
So, you know,
but Janet has sung our life to us.
In the run-up to the Super Bowl halftime show,
Janet was still on top.
Her last album before that performance, All For You,
it had come out in 2001
with another number one single called All For You.
So of course,
Janet was asked to headline the Super Bowl,
because what kind of musicians do you ask
to headline the Super Bowl halftime show?
The heavy hitters.
She's like the biggest star in the world,
and even in 2004,
like from a royal musical family.
So, okay, Super Bowl performance.
We have come to the end of the first half
of Super Bowl 38.
There's our score.
It was Sunday, February 1st, 2004.
The Carolina Panthers were taking on
the New England Patriots in Houston, Texas.
At halftime, it was Janet singing Rhythm Nation
and All For You.
The other performers were P. Diddy, Nelly,
and Kid Rock.
Talk about a moment in time.
And then to close out the show,
it was Janet again,
but this time she was joined by Justin Timberlake
on his song, Rock Your Body.
I'm in the kitchen in Los Angeles.
It's Super Bowl Sunday.
Who cares about the game?
I'm here for the food.
So, so I'm literally doing something in the kitchen,
and I hear, there's a bunch of people at my parents' house,
and I hear gasps and screams.
Oh, wow.
And I walk in, and I promise you,
I feel like everybody that was over,
male and female, had their hand over their mouth.
And I'm like, what?
It happened.
And there somebody said,
somebody snatched off Janet's top.
And then everything unfolds.
Tonight, Janet Jackson is apologizing
for her flash dance.
The singer calls the bodice-ripping move
by fellow entertainer Justin Timberlake
during the Super Bowl halftime show
a last-minute stunt that went too far.
Viewers watched as Timberlake grabbed Jackson's outfit
and ripped it open during a live broadcast on CBS.
Timberlake called it a wardrobe malfunction.
You guys are getting pretty hot and steamy up there.
Hey, man, I love giving y'all something to talk about.
But Janet Jackson says it was not my intention that it-
We could do a whole nother episode
on the phrase wardrobe malfunction.
This phrase eventually became so ubiquitous
that it was nominated by the American Dialect Society
as 2004's Word of the Year.
It also got a nomination for most euphemistic.
The phrase wardrobe malfunction was defined as,
quote, an unanticipated exposure of bodily parts.
This phrase lost on both counts,
a true snub, if you ask me.
And yes, in this moment,
a big, loud part of America was definitely offended,
or at least pretending to be offended,
by that, quote, unanticipated exposure of bodily parts.
Following the halftime show in 2004,
the Federal Communications Commission announced
that it had received a record 540,000 complaints
about the incident.
And they fined CBS a little more than half a million
dollars on an indecency violation.
If you were too young to recall all of this,
trust me when I say there was a whole lot
of pearl-clutching going on.
My son seemed to think that they should sue
Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake
because they were the ones who did it
and it was really nasty.
If the fourth grade boys at a public elementary school
can tell right from wrong,
we need to ask ourselves,
were you corporate CEOs lost your way?
But here's the thing.
When I was watching the halftime show back in 2004,
when it happened, I didn't notice.
For me, it wasn't until the next day
in my music theory class that all my classmates
were talking about it and watching clips
of what happened over and over again.
At the time, Tiwo announced that it was
the most replayed moment in the company's history.
And one of the co-founders of YouTube,
he has cited this exact moment
and the difficulty in finding that video
as inspiration for the creation of YouTube.
Also, if you really think about it,
and maybe that's why to me it just reminds me of violence.
It's a similar thing to me
of how we have to keep seeing
the black people getting beat up by the cops
over and over again,
or seeing the child get shot by the law enforcement
and we have to keep seeing it over and over again.
It does two things.
It, one, grinds it into your brain,
but it also can be numbing, right?
But in either case, it's almost like, why?
Why is this violent moment, this being shown to us
over and over and over again?
And also, of course, the main question then is
why did it do so much damage to Janet's reputation
without doing similar damage to justice?
It was as if that piece of fabric
that was ripped from her clothing
was replaced with some big scarlet letter.
It was just as if the world said,
we're done with you now because of this.
This was a moment that lasted all but a second,
and yet it essentially stopped a 30-plus year career
in its tracks.
After that halftime show, Janet was blacklisted.
MTV refused to play her music videos,
stations stopped playing her songs,
and Janet didn't appear at the Grammy Awards
just a few days later.
Her invitation was conditional on her apology.
But Justin went and apologized,
and he took home two awards that night,
one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance,
and another for Best Pop Vocal Album.
Listen, I know it's been a rough week on everybody,
and what occurred was unintentional,
completely regrettable,
and I apologize if you guys are offended.
This has been a dream of mine.
Don't, I already got enough, don't.
In 2006, Janet sat down with Oprah Winfrey
for what she said at the time
was the final word on the issue.
Do you think in any way that Justin Timberlake
left you hanging out there?
I am speaking to Ms. Jackson.
Do you?
Well, all the emphasis was put on me,
not on Justin, and...
That same year, Justin told MTV
that if you considered what happened back then,
50-50, he only got 10% of the blame.
I think that says something about society.
You know, I think that America's harsher on women,
and I think that America's, you know,
unfairly harsh on ethnic people.
We reached out to Janet's publicity team,
and we were told that she has no comment.
Justin Timberlake also had no comment.
But earlier this year, Justin did post an apology
on Instagram to both Janet and Britney Spears.
He said, quote,
I am deeply sorry for the times in my life
where my actions contributed to the problem,
where I spoke out of turn
or did not speak up for what was right.
The fact is, after the halftime show,
Janet's career suffered while Justin's thrived.
So much so that in 2018,
Justin was invited back to perform
at the Super Bowl halftime show, this time solo.
I use the word criminal a lot
when I talk about black people in music,
and specifically, you know,
me always talking about black women in music,
not receiving the credit that they're due.
I really think that it's criminal that we,
as you started this conversation,
that we forget the impact
that Janet Jackson has had on music.
It's bloody and it's criminal.
What do you think is the biggest lesson
or takeaway about the music industry,
about American celebrity culture,
about the way black women are treated in music?
What's the biggest takeaway for any of those things
from the Super Bowl incident?
I mean, the biggest takeaway from
Janet not receiving the credit that is due to her
in this world of culture that we all live in
is, to me, how little has changed
since the days when like Ma Rainey and stuff
were making music.
Mm.
The days when people like Leontine Price
were having to fight, you know,
to be on stage at some of the best opera houses
around the world when Marian Anderson can't sleep
in hotels, you know, in the cities
where she's playing to pack houses
of black and non-black audiences.
When you think about how hard Motown had to fight
to get black music played on pop stations,
the same battle that artists like Whitney Houston,
Gladys Knight, Tony Braxton, the fights,
they still had to fight to get played on pop radio.
And this is when pop radio mattered
in the pre-streaming era.
These were real fights.
And then we have to be in a situation
where Janet is, to me, victimized
on Super Bowl Sunday.
Yeah.
And it makes the blame for it.
Yeah.
Like the takeaway is, wow, it hasn't changed that much.
That's the takeaway, that times change
and maybe there's more magazine covers
and maybe there's more sales and more streaming,
but it hasn't changed that much.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, in the last year,
there has been a new kind of conversation
around the way women in pop music are treated.
And a lot of that conversation was started
by what's happening with Britney Spears.
She's been in this conservatorship for years.
She's had very public mental health issues.
And as she has been arguing
to get out of that conservatorship,
there's a new conversation about whether or not
our society is nice enough to women like Britney
or Janet or Beyonce and whether the machine of celebrity
chews them up and then spits them out.
And when those conversations began,
I said, okay, this is good.
But I began to notice over time
that the conversation seems to focus
and correct me if I'm wrong,
it seemed to focus more on white women in pop
than on black women in pop.
Because you think about Janet and Britney,
there's a direct through line there.
Janet did so much of what we see in Britney's work first.
And both of them were connected
for a while to Justin Timberlake.
And yet this conversation around the way
we treated Britney and the way that Justin
treated Britney, it felt like it didn't extend
to the way that Justin treated Janet
or the way that the industry treated Janet.
One, do you think that's correct to say?
And two, what's up with that?
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's like,
a thing about being a black woman of which I am one,
you know, I think that people so often think
that whatever it is, we can manage it.
That somehow, you know, we're just like stronger
in particular than white ladies, white girls.
That we just can take it emotionally,
we can take it physically, you know,
we can just plow through because, you know,
we're strong, we're a strong black woman
as the saying goes, you know, we're so strong,
you know, we can just push it, pull it, lift it,
deal with it, management.
Well, you know what, that's lies.
I think that is the important conversation
that's come out of it for our part,
is that no, I don't think that black women
are being extended as much grace,
you know, as is being extended to Britney.
And I think it should all be extended to Britney,
but that black girls need that same generosity
of spirit coming from people.
Yeah.
Let me go on ahead and quote Karen White.
She said, I'm not your superwoman.
I'm not your superwoman.
I'm not the kind of girl that you can let down
and think that everything is okay.
Boy, I am only human.
I mean, let's go.
Let's go, let's let that be.
Let's bring that anthem back, can we?
