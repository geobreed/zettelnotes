The Pandora Papers released this week reveal how some world leaders allegedly hold wealth outside of their countries through the use of shell companies.

And the news reminded us of the time we set up our very own Planet Money shell companies. In this episode, we dive deep into the world of offshore companies and bank accounts. We set up our own company in a tax haven and we find the easiest place to register a business anonymously.

For more about our two shell companies, "Unbelizable Inc." and "Delawho? LLC," check out these episodes:

**faster whisper:**
Quick announcement here. We're gonna be at New York City Comic Con this Friday October 8th doing a panel about
Reviving an old superhero. So if you're gonna be there, look us up come say hi. It'd be great to see you
This is planet money from NPR
Everybody Alexi here this week as you might have seen the Pandora papers dropped
This is a huge collection of nearly 12 million documents released by the International Consortium of investigative journalists
The papers reveal how many world leaders allegedly hold wealth outside of their countries
The president of Kenya for instance was reported to have 30 million dollars hidden in shell companies
Formed in Panama the Czech Prime Minister was tied to a 22 million dollar house in Cannes France
The King of Jordan was tied to more than a hundred million dollars in foreign property
All of these properties were hidden through shell companies and those shell companies were often created right here in the US
Since the leak the politicians featured in the papers have defended their actions as legal
But many are facing strong criticism in their countries in some cases their holdings in other countries seem at odds with their
anti-corruption pushes at home
This is of course the latest big leak of data revealing how the world's elite handle their money and often avoid paying taxes
And some of the details in the papers reminded us of our experience when we set up our very own planet money shell companies
We weren't trying to do anything illegal
But we wanted to get a sense of how easy it would be to get in on some of this offshore secrecy
So enjoy that episode hosted by Chana Jaffee Walt and Adam Davidson
Then stick around to the end to hear what the Pandora papers have revealed about the world of tax havens in 2021
Hi, my name is Chana Jaffee Walt. I'm calling hoping to set up a shell company
Somewhere offshore came in islands, Belize, Bahamas
I don't know. I would love your help trying to figure out how to do that. Thanks very much
Honey, you sound so nervous there. I didn't get a little nervous
It's kind of awkward to figure out how to ask somebody how to set up a shell company
It's not something I knew how to do and I didn't expect it to be so easy
I literally googled offshore company registration and got 15 million results and
Right there. There were lots and lots of websites with phone numbers listed for anyone to call
Thank you for calling globes America press forward to access our customer service department
Hannah it sounds like you're hold should we introduce the show? Let's do it. Hello and welcome to planet money
I'm kind of Jaffee Walt and I'm Adam Davidson on today's show
We have been hearing all this stuff about these offshore tax havens
So we wanted to know hey, can we get in on that? Can we get some of that action?
So today on the show we try to set up our own
company in an offshore tax haven

Hello. Good morning. This is Richard. How can I help you? Hi, Richard?
My name is Hannah Jaffee Walt and calling hoping to talk to somebody about setting up an offshore company. Okay. All right
Well, first of all, I'm Richard. I'm a senior administrative assistant at International Corporate Services
Our rates are the most competitive in the market right now
Richard Williams tells me from what is a terrible phone line in Belize
That his company has the most competitive rates in the market right now
$650 to register a company in Belize
Which does sound cheaper than I expected, but we didn't want to just take his word for it
So we called around on a vibe a day with fidelity corporate services told me she could register a company for me in Belize
For seven hundred and eighty dollars and she also offers other jurisdictions
She said it'd be eight hundred dollars for a company in the Seychelles and a thousand dollars for the British Virgin Islands
Well, all of these jurisdictions there are
extent of tax duties
We don't have to pay any taxes
Yeah, that's right. Now you in one of those places
I'm from Latvia
So Hannah between you and me we talked to or at least visited the websites of at least a dozen different companies
Those are the only two that let us record we found prices that range from just over
$500 to one guy the minimum was over three thousand dollars
And after you call a couple of these people you sort of realize that there's a script that they followed
sales pitch number one
Which is basically what Anna told me that there are no taxes in the jurisdiction where you register
And then they usually sort of seamlessly move into sales pitch number two
Which is no one will know your money is here. So just listen here's Richard and then Anna
What does that mean that you can ensure confidentiality
The companies have any access to this information
So if somebody comes to you and says I want to know if Hanna Jaffewald has money in this Belize company
What would you say?
It's a confidential information and we cannot provide this information
What if it's the US government?
To US government, we don't give information
However, US government can turn to the government of Belize or government of Seychelles
and request
Legal cooperation but without court order we don't give information to anybody
So if the US government went to Belize and said we want to know if Hanna Jaffewald has money in a registered
company here and then
Belize issued a court order then you would give up my information
Then yes if Belize issues this court order then yes
But if it comes from United States straight to our office we would say that no
Sorry, this is confidential information and we cannot give it Anna told me to get started
I just need to send her three things a notarized passport proof of address like a recent utility bill and
The terms and conditions document that she would send to me and when I asked about the passport ID
She kept apologizing that I had to send her an ID like Adam
Did you get this when you talk to people like I'm really sorry
But I just I do have to get these documents from you. I'm required by law. Yeah one woman specifically said
Oh, I really wish I didn't have to get any documents from you
But every offshore government requires it and I did some digging into so why is this?
Why I thought these places were totally, you know, no rules and not that long ago
They pretty much were I mean certainly 20 years ago and probably most of the offshore jurisdictions 10 years ago
Just about anyone could show up or make a phone call and register a company with no
Documentation at all. It could just be a completely anonymous shell company
but since the
1990s and really heating up since 9-eleven the US and the EU have gotten together to clamp down on all this they
Want to stop money laundering they want to stop, you know terrorist financing and they want to capture taxes
So the US and the EU have pressured all these offshore jurisdictions and said you need to pass laws
Requiring people to submit identifying information
We need to know there's a living breathing human being behind each of these offshore companies
And this is sort of one of the tricky things about this world because these offshore countries, you know
They might be small countries, but they are independent nations and they have every right to pass whatever laws they want
They're not colonies of the US or Europe at least not anymore
Right, although sometimes they say it feels like they still are and you know
These offshore centers make a lot of money off of this kind of offshore activity
I talked to one guy in the tiny island of Jersey who said that something like
70 80 percent of their GDP is either directly or indirectly based on these offshore centers
And so the last thing these offshore centers want is to completely scare away everyone
So what seems to have come about at least for now is sort of this uneasy piece where they pass these laws requiring really strict
Identifying information and then they promised look we're not gonna dig into this too much and we're really really sorry
We have to do this at all, right?
Which is why Richard and Anna both apologized but said we do need to have documents from you
It's it's the law and then would repeat again and again, don't worry. We do not share that information with anyone
No one will be able to find your money at which point I asked well
What about the money like a corporation is just a legal entity
How do I get money into the company because you know, the whole idea here is supposed to be about money
And they both were really quick on this. They said oh, yeah. Yeah, that's a service
We provide your company in Belize or in the British Virgin Islands can have its own bank account
And this will not be you setting up the bank account your company can get a bank account and we will set it up for you
This is also one not one service that we offer opening bank accounts for the companies and
Where would the bank account be?
Their bank account can be in well, we have several banks in Belize
We have banks in social health and we have banks in other countries in the world. Can you open a Swiss bank account?
Yes, we can do that and we can open a bank account for you there
So I can create a bank account in Switzerland. That's tied to my shell company in Belize
Yes, you can do that. How quickly can I do that?
Setting up a company is quite fast from the moment when we receive your documents
Scanned by email we can open a company in a couple of days in one week. It can definitely be done
I could talk to you in Latvia and register a company in Belize that has a Swiss bank account and I could do that in a week
Yes, we're in the 21st century and all that is possible
Yeah
That's such an ambiguous thing. We are in the 21st century. So all that is possible on the one hand
Yes money flows around the world at the 21st century like it never has before but on the other hand
You know 21st century this is supposed to be when there's far more controls far more
regulation and scrutiny of that money and and that's sort of at the heart of what you and I've been struggling with ever since
We found out just how easy it is to set up these accounts
What are we supposed to think about this and we've consulted NPR's lawyers New York Times lawyers other people and as far as we
Can tell everything that
Certainly everything we did everything Anna and Richard and the other companies we contacted did is
Absolutely perfectly legal. It's legal in America to set up a company in another country. It's legal in those countries
It's legal for them to help us set up these companies. It's legal to set up bank accounts owned by those companies
All of this is totally above board
but at the same time
It feels sketchy weird that this whole system is set up to hide things
The the word confidentiality comes up all the time on all the websites we saw in every conversation we had
This is totally confidential. Nobody will see it. No government will see it
No authority will see it and it's just hard to think of lots and lots of legal reasons
Why someone would want to hide their money or at the very least lots and lots of ethical?
Reasonable non sketchy reasons to hide their money. It's hard for me to think why exactly would I want an account in some country?
I'm never gonna visit that nobody can see access to that
No authority can see access to well
I can think of some legitimate reasons why you might want it, you know
Like have a company and believes with the bank account in Switzerland
You can imagine maybe you know, you've been in prison or you're a recovered drug addict and you want to do business
But you don't want people knowing your history or seeing your name in the company
Or maybe you're bidding on a contract and you're a young guy just sitting in your living room
You don't want everyone to know that it's just you in your company or a bigger business. That's you know wanting to explore
Expanding into some new market and doesn't want people to know that they're there
And the other argument you hear is, you know, really huge multinationals that has business all over the world
They don't want to bring it back here and pay any
Unnecessary taxes and go through complex US regulation every time they're Bulgarian subsidiary send some parts to their Romanian
Factory and then that stuff is sold to some Tajikistan
Client they say oh, it's just a lot easier. It's a lot more convenient
But that raises a question
Why are so many of the products that these people wanted to sell to us?
designed specifically to
Obfuscate not designed to make life easier more convenient
But the opposite to make life more complex to hide things from people like for example, we learned about shelf companies
There's shell companies, but shelf companies are companies literally sitting on a shelf
They register lots and lots of just generic companies and then you could buy one two years later five years later
That way it will look like hey, Hanako was founded in
2007 you didn't just found it yesterday. It didn't just open yesterday. It's been around for a long long time or
Maybe you're a big company
You're thinking of going into you know
some part of the world where you haven't been competing before and you don't want people to know you're this new arrival or
You don't want your competitors to figure out what you're doing
So you buy an older company and make it seem like there's nothing new going on here
but pretty much every service that Richard and Anna tried to sell me on top of my business had to do with
basically trying to mislead people about what my business is which again totally legal but just the
nakedness of it feels
Weird like Anna told me about this one service that is really popular called nominee services
And she says, you know
Just think if you don't want an official record of you being the owner of your company
We can help you with that with nominee services
If you choose this service you can nominate us to be the directors of your company and also shareholders of your company
And you know public documents where the directors name appears. It will be our name
Wait, you would be the directors and shareholders of our company
You can choose this service
It's a service that you pay for it's only a service that we offer if you don't want your name to appear on any company's documents
You can choose us to be nominee directors or shareholders
But if I did that then it it looks like the company is run by you guys by the names on the documents
Nobody knows that I'm involved in the company
Yeah, that is the idea an absolute confidentiality
This blew my mind you can hire a board of directors to be the public face of your company
And it's not just Anna who offers this service. No everyone we talked to this is clearly a nice little moneymaker
Although not a huge one
They make like 600 bucks or something to be your board of directors to be your public facing shareholders
And then they sign with you a totally private invisible power of attorney
So they are the public face, but you run the company
Although no one needs to know that you run the company and it clearly was a popular feature
Which is crazy when you think about like, you know, we saw dozens and dozens
We assume there are thousands of these companies helping people set up companies, which makes you think when you do the math that
The Caribbean Islands the Channel Islands all these offshore
Havens must be filled with people who are the boards of directors of thousands and thousands of companies out there
That they know nothing about have never met the people involved have no actual activity with that company
Yeah, when I asked Richard and believes about this
He told me about his nominee services, too
And when I talked to him, I was like who does this like who actually would be the director of my company
And he said oh desert is a popular company
And he said oh desert is a popular choice
Desiree Desiree
She could be the director of my company. Yeah, so she gets used a lot. She's the director of a lot of companies
Yeah, is that legal? That's totally legal. That's that's totally legal. It's legal
Can I have shareholders somewhere other than believes?
Not to my knowledge. I'm sure you could but we've never done it like that before
Okay
Richard who are you like are you in Belize?
Yes, I'm in Belize
Do you mind my asking how old you are?
I'm very young
21 years old
You're 21?
Yes
And so all day long you basically are like taking calls and emails about people wanting to set up offshore companies
Yes, basically that's it
Do you like the job?
Yes, I love it
You do?
The best job I've had so far
Best job you've had so far?
Out of high school I want to do this job
You graduated from high school and your dream was to register offshore companies?
My dream was to venture into a job that deals with law and work my way up from there
Richard wants to work his way up to be a lawyer
He's saving money working in this job so that he can get himself to Barbados to get an associates and then to Jamaica to get a law degree
And in the meantime he's spending his days talking to American surgeons who want to hide their money in case they get sued for malpractice
Or people you know mostly Americans avoiding taxes
And he says landing a job in the offshore sector is perfect because all the law firms in Belize that he wants to work with have huge offshore departments
So it's really great job experience
And we ended up going with Richard to register our company right?
I was out of the office for a few days
We had all these different candidates and when I came back you're like Richard we're going with Richard
I love that guy
Yeah so we chose his company and he sent us over the forms
You basically have to fill out the intended use of your business in this form and the countries you expect you'll be operating in
And then which add-on services you'd like you know like do you want a board of directors?
Do you want an aged company?
And you need to tell them what you want your name to be
Yeah we had fun trying to come up with a name
We looked at the names that AIG had for all its offshore entities that became public as part of all the AIG scandals
And Omnivantage Insurance was a favorite
And one of the companies that I looked at they offered us several of these old existing shelf companies
So we could have been Stock Reward Corporation, Technologic Incorporated, Traders Bridge Inc, Techno Smart Inc
Kebab International I liked that one, Zrein Holdings
Your slogan could be it's spelled like urine but with a Z
Right and why would anybody want to buy a company called Marcel Simes Consulting who is not Marcel Simes?
We've been joking that most of the offshore companies names follow two patterns
They're either as generic and boring as possible like I remember universal exports in the Bond franchise
Or they're names that turn out to be often a secretly dirty inside joke
Or you could just go with a really juvenile pun which is essentially what we decided to do at Planet Money
At some point I was talking to Zoe about opening this offshore company in Belize and she said
You're opening an offshore company in Belize? Unbelievable!
And it just kind of stuck I have to say the more times that I write unbelievable on formal corporate documents
The better that name gets it just never gets old
You know Hannah I can't say I'm a huge fan of Unbelievable
I feel like we have a certain gravitas that we're trying for here that Unbelievable blocks
But I'm on board I'm now you know while I'm not in any way a board member or stock holder of Unbelievable
I am proud to be associated with it it will of course have a Belizean Board of Directors
We did ask for Richard to be on our board but he says he's not sure he's allowed to yet
Because he's still a new staffer there so we'll probably get Desiree we assume
And she may or may not have anything to do with Unbelievable's business operations
Now we definitely opted for a bank account in a different country
So you don't have the bank account in Belize that way if the IRS is going after you
They have to file court orders in two jurisdictions Belize and the other country as well
Not that we're planning to evade taxes
Not that we're evading taxes our books are open
So right now our options are Cyprus, Panama, Saint Vincent, Latvia, and Switzerland
I've also been looking into Singapore and Bulgaria
But I have to say setting up the bank account has actually been the most complicated part
You know getting the business and getting the nominee services I just have to send some documents
But getting the bank account added this whole layer of complexity
Richard and I have been in constant communication
I had to get my passport notarized and fax it to him
And send him a reference letter from my bank
And my bank wrote a reference letter that Richard's company then rejected
And said it didn't include enough detail
And my bank is now saying that they don't want to send a letter with more detail
So Richard said get a letter from your accountant and a lawyer
So I went to my accountant and asked for a letter
Which by the way is embarrassing to ask your accountant for a letter for your offshore Belizean company called Unbelievable
And I don't have a lawyer so I don't know what to do about that
It's actually been more complicated than advertised I have to say
Richard and I are a week and a half into our relationship
28 emails in and the email subject has changed from RE thanks for your help
To RE due diligence and Richard keeps assuring me that the company should be registered
Within the next few days we just have to do our due diligence
Now we had our little experiment with a few companies
But we found this guy Jason Sharman he's a professor at Griffith University in Australia
Who sort of did what we did wholesale
He wanted to find out in a statistically significant way how the rules are being followed
So he applied to have corporations incorporated all over the world
And he had a very similar experience to us although I have to say with one shocking difference
Originally I did about 50 approaches and in 17 of those cases the providers were happy to sell me a company
Without any identity documents at all which is in clear violation of international rules
No passport no ID number nothing
No no no passport no ID number no driver's license nothing at all
So really they had no idea who I was at all
He did say that most countries did require ID to register a company
Except he said there was this one country that stood out as the most willing in all the world
To allow people to open companies with no documentation whatsoever
So what is that most permissive the most secret loving country in the world?
The United States
So in fact that the standards of the US were say even lower than those in Somalia
It's easier to be totally anonymous as a business owner in the United States than anywhere else
The easiest place in the world to register a business anonymously is definitely the United States
The four sort of most lax states were particularly Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming and Oregon
At first Jason Sharman looked at his data and thought
This must be wrong I must have made some mistake in the way I'm going about this
But then he tried again he got students to do it dozens and dozens of times
I think by the end he's done it over a thousand times in the US and around the world asking
Hey I'd like to set up an offshore company and I don't want to show you any identification
And again we found that places like the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands and Jersey
And one of the Channel Islands were very very strict
And people would email back and say look we'll sell you a company
But you must send us a scanned notarized copy of the picture page of your passport
So we can keep it on file so we know who you are
But in the United States the answer was sure this should take you about ten minutes
Just fill in the details of the company you want on the website
Transfer the money and we'll send you the company today
I think it would be interesting if you tried to set up a company
And compare how many documents they ask for compared to how many the people in Belize ask for
Hi I wanted to talk to someone about registering a company in Delaware
So obviously we had to take Jason up on his challenge
Yes I called a couple places that register companies in the US
And I reached one guy who talked to me but he wouldn't let me record
But our conversation was pretty brief so Adam you and I can basically sum it up right here
It went something like this
Hello I'd like to set up a company in the US
I would recommend a Nevada or a Wyoming company
Nevada is $599
Wyoming is $529
Or you could go with Delaware that's $519
Delaware it is. What documents do you need?
We'd need the name of the company
We'd need the name of the manager
And the address where you want the documents sent
What about identification?
We don't need any identification
We just need you to give us the name of the company
Give us a name for the manager
And where do you want the documents sent?
And that was pretty much it Adam
We are now the proud owners here at Planet Money of Delahue
Oh man
Love these cute names
That one was Caitlin Kenny
And I have to say setting up Delahue it only took one day
It was three emails and it would have been just one email
Except I had some extra questions such as
Is this really all you need?
Answer yes
So we've been kind of giddy like we now own a company in Delaware
And by the way in the tables of offshore jurisdictions
Delaware is listed
Offshore these days has shifted from meaning an actual island
Offshore somewhere to just any place in the world
Where it's really really easy to set up corporations
That charges little or no taxes that sort of thing
And so we've been kind of giddy like oh wow we now have two companies
Blah blah blah
But talking to Jason Sharman he reminded us like
While many many uses of offshore accounts
Are likely perfectly legal and legitimate
There are some really really disturbing things that can be done
When you own a thoroughly anonymous US based company
Given that a company is a legal person
You can use this company to own property
You can use it to lease ships or aircraft
But as I say own shares do all the sorts of things
That in some ways a real individual can do
Or we could do it the other way around
The totally anonymous and secretive Delahue could be the owner of Unbelieveable
They could both own bank accounts in foreign countries
Or they could together create some third company
With this kind of layered ownership
And that could own a bank account in some other country
There are endless possibilities
Jason says that now that he like us has seen the offshore world from the inside
He feels a lot less nervous about these offshore tax havens
The Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands and Belize
And all of those places
Because he says you know certainly not a perfect system
But there are more rules that are more thoroughly enforced
Due diligence is happening at least in some cases
At least in some cases
But he said what made him really terrified
Really nervous much more than he expected
Is what's going on in the rich countries
The country's bossing the rest of the world around
We first set up our shell companies back in 2012
And since then Delaware has actually been unseated
As the most sought out secrecy haven in the United States
That distinction now belongs to South Dakota
Where Americans and foreigners alike have been flocking to set up similarly baroque ownership structures
That allow them to keep wealth hidden for generations
South Dakota was heavily featured in this week's leaks in the Pandora papers
There have been some efforts at reform here and around the world in recent years
Most notably a shared reporting system
That some countries adopted after the U.S. cracked down on tax havens like Switzerland
But the U.S. doesn't require states like Delaware or South Dakota to participate
And the U.S. is now the number two tax haven in the world
According to the Tax Justice Network
Putting us only behind the Cayman Islands
If you're going to Comic-Con in New York this Friday
We're going to be there
