There was one time the U.S. federal government stopped borrowing and paid off every penny of national debt. It did not end well. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

This episode originally aired on May 13, 2011.

On January 8, 1835, all the big political names in Washington gathered to celebrate what President Andrew Jackson had just accomplished. A senator rose to make the big announcement: "Gentlemen ... the national debt ... is PAID." The huzzahs rose up around the halls of Congress, or something like that.

That was the one time in U.S. history when the country was debt free. We had actually paid it all off, which never happens. It lasted exactly one year. And we've been arguing about the debt ever since, issuing treasury bonds along the way.

On today's Planet Money: A brief history of the national debt. Where the debt came from — at first, it seemed like a great idea, at least according to Alexander Hamilton — what happened the one time we paid it all off, and why Congress created the debt ceiling in the first place.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.
Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sat down in front of members of Congress in
Washington and she said something that sounded pretty scary.
She said if Congress doesn't vote to raise the debt ceiling, the US government
will run out of money by October 18th.
That's right, in less than three weeks, America would go effectively broke if Congress
didn't give permission for more government borrowing, more debt.
This would be the first time in its history the US Treasury would not be
able to pay its bills.
It would default.
And the result, Yellen said, if that did happen, would likely be another
financial crisis.
All of which raises a couple of very important questions.
What exactly is the debt ceiling?
And why does the US government have to keep raising it or risk financial
collapse?
So we're pulling today's episode from the vault about a time when America had
no debt, paid it all off.
And little spoiler, government debt isn't necessarily a bad thing.
This episode originally ran in 2011 and was reported by Robert Smith and
Adam Davidson.
Coming up after the break.

First up, really basic question.
What exactly is the national debt?
It's key to not think of it as one thing.
Because it's actually a bunch of promises.
It's millions and millions of specific promises that the government has made
to specific people.
The government spends more than it takes in just about every year.
That is called a deficit, a yearly deficit.
And the government borrows the difference from international financiers,
people who know the government inside and out.
People like this person.
My name is Elsie Smith and I am seven and three quarters.
I happen to know Elsie Smith.
She's a friend of mine.
And in fact, she is your daughter, Robert.
Yeah, but that's not important right now.
What she is is a creditor of the U.S.
government.
Listen to what she discovered in my drawer.
United States saving bonds, $50.
Why did you loan the government that money?
To keep it safe.
Yeah, that's absolutely right.
You did loan it to them to keep it safe.
And they used your money to buy things like maybe a rivet on a fighter
plane or something.
What's a rivet?
It's a little thing that holds the plane together.
I want my $50 back.
Wow.
Our international financiers are so fickle.
You know, it's funny.
Even at seven years old, she somehow, and I didn't tell her this,
she somehow managed to look at this thing, the savings bond and understand
what is most fundamental about government debt.
It's safe. It's completely safe.
The U.S. has never gone back on its promise.
She could get that $50 tomorrow with interest back if I let her.
So to understand what the debt is, you got to add up all the Elsies
of the world, all the retirement funds and central banks with lots
and lots of treasury bills or savings bonds in their drawers.
And even if you don't have a bond in your drawer, you have effectively
lent the money to the government somewhere.
Like maybe it's your checking account or your savings account, that
guaranteed interest that you get.
It's probably backed by treasury bonds, by government debt.
And we're always hearing about how China holds over a trillion dollars
of U.S. bonds, Japan, many, many governments around the world.
And when you add up all those promises, all those different people
and institutions that the U.S. government has said, hey, we're going
to pay you back, that is the national debt.
Today, we're going to explain how we got into this mess, where all
this debt came from, what happened when we tried to pay it off, and
who came up with this whole debt ceiling idea in the first place.
Now, it turns out we've been fighting about the debt since
the United States was born.
OK, we're going to cue some old timey music here.
Good day and fare thee well, Brother Davidson.
Fare thee well, Elder Smith.
OK, we're back in revolutionary war days, as if you couldn't
tell from that spot on impression.
This is when the first debate over the national debt started.
And it's important to remember that the U.S.
debt wasn't something that just happened automatically.
In fact, the United States in its very first few days made a
conscious decision to have a debt, to issue these bonds
and promise to pay it back.
I spoke with Robert E.
Wright. He's a professor of political economy at Augustana
College in South Dakota.
What really happened is we fought a long and bloody
revolution against the world's greatest superpower and
racked up 80 million dollars in debt doing so.
Couldn't we have said, sorry, folks, it's a revolution.
We're wiping out all the debt.
We could have, but thankfully we didn't.
And we didn't because of a man named Alexander Hamilton.
He was the secretary of treasury, the very first one,
and he argued that the United States faced a fundamental
choice.
If we don't take responsibility for the debt,
all those farmers that lent us money and the soldiers we
didn't pay and the French who lent us money,
the rest of the world won't trust us.
They won't lend us money.
We won't be able to trade.
We'll be stuck.
The United States will be stuck living off whatever we
grow here in our farms.
And back then, the US didn't grow that much.
We brought much of our consumables from Europe.
You know, the HBO series John Adams did a great job
of depicting Hamilton's argument.
The future of prosperity of this nation rests chiefly
in trade.
Trade depends, among other things,
on the willingness of other nations to lend us money.
And how would you propose to establish
international credit?
Our first step would be to incur a national debt.
The greater the debt, the greater the credit.
And to that end, I have recommended to the president
that Congress adopt all the debts incurred
by the individual states during the war
through a national bank, the idea
being that if the states owe Congress money,
then other nations will feel more inclined to lend it to us.
Now Hamilton, who was pro-debt,
was fighting with Thomas Jefferson
because Thomas Jefferson had a very different view.
He felt that debt was extremely dangerous.
And when you hear this speech that Jefferson gave,
or at least the actor playing him in that HBO series
gave, it's a speech that I feel
like with very little change could be given today.
If the states are indebted to a central authority,
it increases the power of the central government.
You have it exactly.
I fear a revolution will have been in vain
if a Virginia farmer is to be held in hock
to a New York stock jobber,
who in turn is in hock to a London banker.
The opportunities for avarice and corruption
would certainly prove irresistible.
And this fight between Northeast bankers
and the rest of the country,
this has been going on for 200 years.
It's going on today.
Now Hamilton won out initially.
The United States accepted its debt.
It promised to pay.
But Professor Robert Wright says
that most politicians at the time,
they felt much more like Jefferson.
Okay, fine, Hamilton, we'll pay off our old debt,
but let's not make a habit out of this.
So what the battle was really about
was how quickly to pay off the debt,
not whether to pay it off or not.
And I have to give full disclosure here.
I spoke with Professor Wright
and he told me that he gave his son a unique name.
He named his son Alexander Hamilton was right.
Oh, come on.
He really did.
Really?
He really did.
And in fact, his son came to him the other day,
he told me and said,
shouldn't it be Alexander Hamilton is right?
Because in his view, of course,
Hamilton is right forever.
Wow.
So for the first 40 years or so of the Republic,
we lived in Hamilton's world.
The nation had a debt, a manageable debt.
Banks and bankers in the Northeast flourished.
We did trade with Europe and everybody trusted us.
The country grew and pretty soon US debt,
debt issued by the US government,
was seen as one of the safest investments in the world.
This was Alexander Hamilton's dream
until one president dared to pay it off.
So cue our next chapter
in the amazing life story of the US debt.
January 8th, 1835.
Can we put on character again?
All right, picture it, Adam.
All the big political names in Washington DC
have gathered to celebrate the president, Andrew Jackson.
It was the anniversary of his win
at the Battle of New Orleans,
but there was bigger news that night.
A senator stood up and he raised his glass
and he said, gentlemen, the national debt is paid.
Huzzah!
Huzzah!
Historians tell us the huzzahs rose up around the room.
Finally, the national debt was zero.
It was a big deal.
John Steele Gordon thinks so.
He writes about financial history
and he's the author of the book,
Hamilton's Blessing,
the extraordinary life and times of the national debt.
This was another American accomplishment
that we had actually paid off our national debt.
No other country had ever done that before.
So when Andrew Jackson becomes president,
the debt had become sort of this routine thing
and it actually followed the cycles
that business textbooks tell you a government debt should.
During bad times, during wars,
like the War of 1812 or during economic slowdowns,
the country borrowed,
basically borrowing against their future prosperity.
And then, sure enough, when the hard times were over
and the economy was doing well,
the government would pay back the debt
that it had borrowed,
always maintaining at least some level of debt.
But Andrew Jackson did not like this normal routine picture.
For Andrew Jackson, politics was very personal.
He hated not just the federal debt.
He hated debt at all.
That's H.W. Brands.
He's a professor at the University of Texas
and he wrote a biography of Andrew Jackson
called His Life and Times.
And he tells this great story about Jackson.
So before he was president,
he was out in the wild west of Tennessee
and he was quite the land speculator.
He would often get paid in land
and he was trading all these things.
And at one point, he trades some land for some debt
passed on by somebody else.
Well, this debt goes bad
and Andrew Jackson is left holding the bag.
He's got this massive debt,
worthless paper notes.
And this drove him nuts.
In fact, the guy he did the deal with,
it went to jail.
So when Jackson runs for president,
he knows the enemy, banks and the national debt.
He called it the national curse.
And the voters just ate this up.
Andrew Jackson had an actual plan to get rid of the debt
but he also got very lucky.
When he took office,
there's around $58 million of debt
that the US government owed.
And one way that he paid it off,
there happened to be a huge real estate bubble going on.
And rather than bail out the banks,
it turned out that at the time,
the US owned a lot of land in the wilderness.
They sold it at these inflated bubble prices,
which brought in a lot of money
which went to paying off the debt.
And Jackson was, I'll give him credit,
ruthless on the budget.
I mean, he blocked every spending bill he could.
Highways, government buildings.
It was veto, veto, veto.
So after six years in office, he paid it all off.
It was all gone.
But Jackson suddenly faced this technical problem
that no other president has ever faced,
either before or since.
What do you do when the government has more money
than it needs?
What do you do with the surplus?
Now, back then there was no income tax.
You couldn't just give everybody a refund.
There wasn't really a way to return money to the people.
And what he decided to do was to divide it among the states
according to population.
This is the only time that's happened.
So Andrew Jackson gets rid of the debt.
All of a sudden, the country's running a surplus
and we all live economically happily ever after, right?
Not exactly.
How long did the good times last?
It lasts exactly one year.
One beautiful year.
The state banks apparently went a little crazy
with the surplus.
They were printing massive amounts of paper money
and that land bubble.
I mean, the one that helped Jackson balance the budget,
get rid of the debt.
The land bubble went out of control
and then like all bubbles, it popped.
There was a huge crash
and the beginning of the longest depression
in American history.
It actually lasted six years
before the economy began to grow again.
Now, we're not saying every time you pay off the debt,
you're instantly gonna cause a massive depression,
but there was a clear lesson here.
No matter how much you hate the debt,
eliminating it does not guarantee
that you're gonna have good times.
Even in the early 1800s,
the economy was far too complex for that.
And it turns out that having the debt come back
was pretty useful for the United States.
There was, after all, a civil war to pay for
and a bunch of other economic downturns.
The 1900s were full of them
and it looked like there was no end
to the amount of debt the country could take on.
But that's not the end of the story.
We'll have that after the break.
The final chapter in our story, chapter three,
politicians could not kill the debt monster,
but they decided, well, maybe we can tame it a little.
You see, debt in the United States
was not just getting bigger,
it was getting more complex.
Up until World War I,
Congress had to approve every little bit of borrowing.
Susan Irving is with the Government Accountability Office.
I mean, you know, I wanna borrow money to build X,
and so Treasury would go to Congress
and they would literally approve the form of the security,
the purpose of the security,
what the duration was gonna be,
what the interest rate was gonna be.
So this could take all day long.
You could say bridges, post offices,
a canal through Panama.
Well, if you look at the early appropriations acts,
they're completely earmarked.
I mean, you look at early appropriations acts,
so much for shooing the horses
for the Department of X.
I mean, really, very detailed control.
It is so hard to imagine just Congress,
who are not finance professionals, sitting there
and every single thing the government wants to buy,
they have to decide how much debt to issue,
what the interest rate would be.
Will it be a five-year bond at 3.8%
or a 10-year bond at 4.2%.
It's so hard to imagine.
And what's actually shocking is that for over a century,
they were able to do this.
They were able to keep it together.
But by World War I, it was just too much stuff.
It was too complicated.
If you think about the number of decisions
that go on during a war,
suddenly, if they're gonna have to approve every single one,
you're coming in not once a year,
not once every two years.
You're coming in sort of constantly.
Oh, now we need to borrow up to so much
to build up more tanks.
And you think, really?
At some point, the sheer volume of transactions
overwhelms and begins to drive out the ability
to do thoughtful discussions about big policy.
And Congress loves to do thoughtful discussions
of big policy.
So they delegated.
They delegated the authority.
They told the Treasury Department in 1917
and in various acts after that,
that why don't you all figure out
how much borrowing we need and how you're gonna do it?
But Congress doesn't just give the executive branch
lots and lots of power.
They do not.
No, so they say, okay,
we're gonna give you this job
of figuring out what bonds and what duration
and what interest rate and all that stuff,
but we're not letting you go nuts.
We're gonna have a ceiling.
You can only borrow up to this amount, an upper limit.
And if you need to do more,
if you need to borrow more money,
come back and see us and we'll decide
whether or not to raise the debt ceiling.
But there's something crucial to understand here.
Nothing gets bought by the federal government
unless Congress says so.
I mean, it's in the Constitution.
The power of the purse rests with Congress.
So the debt limit doesn't actually limit the spending.
That would be unconstitutional to limit the spending.
It's a safety check.
I think of it as this big game of mother, may I?
That old kids game.
Congress says to the Treasury Department,
we wanna buy a tank.
And Treasury looks at it and it brings up the debt limit.
And the Treasury Department has to come back to Congress
and say, mother, may I?
Buy a tank and raise the debt limit.
And Congress votes and says, yes, you may.
But what's so ridiculous is all the Treasury
is asking approval to do is spend the money
that Congress has told them to spend.
In other words, Congress says, go spend this money
and then acts all huffy that spending the money
Congress approved is gonna get us over the debt ceiling.
It's so maddening.
And it's something that pretty much
no other country goes through.
They don't go through this whole rigamarole.
They simply approve spending and by implication,
the borrowing is just implicitly approved as well.
But in part, that's because there isn't this separation
between the executive branch,
like the Treasury Department,
and the legislative branch, like the Congress.
So the debt ceiling turns out to be not so much something
to slow the debt,
but it's a sign of good old American distrust.
It's a way for one branch to basically give the hard work
to somebody else, but say, I don't really trust you.
So in a sense, the debt ceiling was a success.
Congress did not have to spend all of its time
worrying about bond issues and durations
and interest rates.
And actually the Treasury used this new freedom
to come up with the sort of economy we see today,
all these efficient forms of issuing various lengths of debt
and using the market to determine the interest rate
that's paid on the bonds.
All these things basically make it easier for the government
and cheaper for the government to get money.
But the debt ceiling did not do its fundamental mission.
It did not in any way contain the growth
in our national debt.
Every year, sometimes more than once a year,
the Treasury Department has come to Congress and said,
mother, may I increase the debt ceiling
so that I can borrow the money to buy the things
that you already told me to buy?
And Congress would say, yes, you may.
And then the debt goes up during the Depression,
during World War II.
And then starting about 50 years ago, the debt explodes.
And what happened is it no longer went through a cycle.
The debt goes up during bad times
and goes down as paid off during good times.
Just administration after administration,
Democrat after Republican, after Democrat after Republican,
the debt just gets bigger and bigger during good times
and during bad ones.
