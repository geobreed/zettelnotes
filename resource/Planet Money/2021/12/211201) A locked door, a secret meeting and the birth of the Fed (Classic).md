On today's show, we tell the origin story of the Federal Reserve — the most powerful financial institution on the planet.

The story includes a 70-year-old man with a bad head cold and a bunch of mistresses, a nation that's deeply ambivalent about a central bank, and a secret meeting on an island with a sketchy name.

Music: "Oxygenate the Idea" and "Say We Go Circular" and "Playing the Game"
