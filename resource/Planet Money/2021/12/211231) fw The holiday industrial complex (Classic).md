Where do holidays like National Potato Chip Day and Argyle Day come from? We trace the roots of one made-up holiday until we find out who is running the global holiday machine. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

*This episode originally aired in 2017*

It's December 31st, and we hope that New Year's Eve celebrations are upon you. But did you know that you could also be celebrating National Champagne Day? And Make Up Your Mind Day? Where do these made-up holidays come from, anyway?

It seems like there are legions of people inventing holidays to get people to buy things. But there are even more holidays that are just... weird. So we figured if we could follow the events that got one of these questionable holidays on TV, then maybe there was a way to find out who is running the holiday machine.

We picked National Splurge Day. It was easy enough to find coverage about it. But few people wanted to talk about how it wound up on their television shows.

Today on the show, we journey to the center of the holiday industrial complex. And we go on a trip that takes us from harried TV news bookers to the halls of Congress to a storage locker in Chicago.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Hello, this is Erika Barris.
We're in the thick of the holiday season,
so we wanted to revisit one of our favorite
Planet Money episodes.
It's about manufactured holidays
and the industry that surrounds them.
This episode originally aired in 2017.
We hope you enjoy it, and have a happy new year.
Newsroom, this is Ed.
Hey, Ed, it's Kenny Malone from NPR.
How's it going, man?
Good, Kenny, how are you?
This guy is Ed Shapui.
He's the news director at Fox 40,
a television station in Sacramento.
But on this particular day,
Ed was so much more than that.
Ed was the key to unlocking a mystery
I had been desperately trying to solve.
Let's start with the facts here.
On June 18th, 2015, you guys ran a segment.
Yep.
Do you remember this segment at all?
I do not, but I clicked the link,
I followed it, and I watched it.
May, she's gonna be telling us about some great eats.
About another big stinkin' deal, guys.
So it was a wonderful, lively segment
with our morning anchor, May Fasai,
and a young lady from Rayleigh's supermarket.
Joining us this morning,
Patty Mistraco with Rayleigh's Something Extra.
And in front of May and Patty
is a table just covered in tarts,
and cakes, and cheeses, and wine.
Yeah, so as a matter of fact,
the notes describe it as decadent food.
Do you know what today is, June 18th?
It's National Splurge Day.
Need I say more?
Uh, yeah, so much more.
National Splurge Day?
This drives me insane,
because it feels like we are suddenly
swimming in bizarro holidays.
Tomorrow is National Puppying Day!
It's National Pancake Day.
Potato chip day.
Ice cream day.
Watermelon day.
It just seems like someone is inventing holidays
to try and sell us a bunch of stuff,
and I wanted to get to the bottom of this,
and so I came up with a plan.
I figured if I could unspool the events
that landed one of these questionable holidays
on television, if I could follow it back to its origins,
then just maybe I could understand
what was powering this holiday machine.
And this is why I wound up on the phone
with Ed Chapuis trying to figure out
how National Splurge Day somehow
wound up on Fox 40 in Sacramento.
And it's funny, I was able to sort of follow
and backtrack from our calendar how we found it.
Oh, really?
Yep, I have done your sleuthing for you.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Kenny Malone,
and joining me on this quest is Noel King.
Today, we take a journey to the center
of the Holiday Industrial Complex.
It's a trip that takes us from TV news
to the halls of Congress,
to a storage locker in Chicago.
It's a story of power, PR,
and one woman actually trying
to make the world a better place.

All right, we are chasing National Splurge Day.
And I will say, it was not hard
to find coverage of this holiday.
Today happens to be known as National Splurge Day,
a day when you're supposed to treat yourself
to something you wouldn't.
Yeah, I love this one.
It's a New York station that did a
what-would-you-splurge-on segment.
Buffalo wings.
You can have anything in the world.
Supermodels, jet around the world,
you want buffalo wings.
I do want buffalo wings.
But it was shockingly hard to get someone
to talk to me about how National Splurge Day
ended up on their TV station.
The Buffalo Wings channel,
they flat out declined to comment.
A guy at another station, he told me,
no one is gonna talk to you on the record about this.
This is like real evasion.
I felt like I was kicking stuff up.
You must be honest on this.
But then I finally found someone who would talk,
our guy, Ed Chapuie, Fox 40, Sacramento.
I have to tell you,
I've never heard of National Splurge Day,
so it doesn't surprise me that we did something about it.
Ed has a five and a half hour morning show to fill,
and he has no shame about National Splurge Day
ending up on his air,
but he too was curious how it got there.
And so he pulls up a log that has every segment
his station has ever run,
and he flips back to 2015, and there it is.
Okay, I'm gonna click on this.
National Splurge Day, exclamation point.
So there's a record of who pitched it,
and it says, what does it say there?
So this is emailed by a PR person.
Saturday, June 18th is National Splurge Day.
What you're probably asking,
what the heck is National Splurge Day?
That is literally what I'm asking, yes.
Yeah, so it has the contact person,
and her name is Kat Madrew.
That means if you're wanting to backtrack,
and it has your cell phone number in there.
Oh, fantastic.
Hello.
Hey, is this Kat?
It is.
Kat Madrew is the first lead in our investigation.
She's the PR person for Rayleigh's,
which is a grocery store chain in California and Nevada.
Kat told me, yeah,
I pitched National Splurge Day to Fox 40.
It was a way to get the grocery store on TV,
but she can't remember exactly where she got it from.
She told me that she just Googles food holidays,
and there are a crazy amount of them.
Do you keep a running list of these holidays?
I do.
I have a folder on my computer with the different holidays.
And do you have it in front of you?
Maybe.
Could you open it and read me some?
Let's see, la la la.
She's got National Garlic Month.
National Meatball Day.
Even National Raisin Day.
I will tell you right now
that that is later on this month,
and I have a taker,
and I haven't gotten around
to exactly what we're gonna be talking about.
Wait, wait, wait.
So you already pitched National Raisin Day
to a media outlet,
and they said yes without knowing
what you would do about it?
Yes, and I imagine we could maybe do some trail mix,
we could do some baking,
we could throw it in salads.
Okay, so National Raisin Day
is not the holiday we're after,
but it ended up being a very helpful lead.
Because, because, after I hung up with Kat.
Bye bye. Bye bye.
We started poking around,
and National Raisin Day is over 100 years old.
Yeah, we found an article from 1910
complaining about how it was shameless promotion
by raisin growers in the Fresno Chamber of Commerce.
And this is the way some strange days are born.
It's exactly what you would think.
Money plus corporate interests
plus maybe a good PR person,
and sometimes even the government is involved.
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
In fact, the United States Congress
used to be a holiday factory.
I rise today to talk about National Golf Day.
You'll hear these called commemorative periods.
We're still gonna call them holidays.
At one point, Congress got a little out of hand
with the passing of made-up holidays.
The peak came in 1985 and 86.
This is during the 99th Congress.
During that time, one in every three laws
was a commemorative day or week or month.
That is to say,
Congress passed 664 laws during that session.
227 of those were things like
National Air Traffic Control Day,
National Bowling Week,
and National Birds of Prey Month.
Legislators were spending so much time
announcing crazy holidays
that finally in 95, the House of Representatives said enough,
and they passed a rule
forbidding the introduction of this stuff.
We looked, and during the Congressional holiday mania,
there was no national splurge day passed.
But we also learned that after the holiday crackdown,
people still wanted a way to get their
made-up special days legitimized, and they found one.
Drizzly, Chicago, it's cold.
I was here to visit Holly McGuire.
If there were a VIP club for holidays,
Holly is the bouncer.
Holly, great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Holly is the editor-in-chief
of something called Chase's Calendar of Events.
We walk into her office,
and she shows me the 2017 edition of the book.
It's very heavy.
I haven't weighed it.
It's 752 pages.
752 pages of all kinds of holidays,
everything from Easter Sunday to Talk Like a Pirate Day.
Do you guys call yourself the official keeper
of holidays and special days?
Oh, we're a little shy about actually doing that.
Is that because we're in the Midwest now?
That could be, that could be.
But you are, right?
Yes, we try to be.
Chase's is like the Oxford English Dictionary
of Holidays.
Yeah, but Chase's didn't really mean to become that.
This book started in 1957.
Back then, it was a pamphlet to help keep track
of holidays that change around from year to year.
But eventually, Chase's started allowing submissions
for special days, as they call them.
And then when Congress issued its holiday crackdown,
the world seemed to turn to Chase's.
Right, and people started submitting to us
to kind of fill that void.
And this is where the search
for National Splurge Day gets interesting,
because it was in Chase's,
but it isn't anymore.
What?
Uh-huh.
About a decade ago,
the inventor apparently called Chase's
or emailed or something and asked to have it pulled out.
Holly doesn't know all of the details,
but she says she can still help us.
So she scoots over to her laptop,
she pulls up this list.
Which is huge.
It's divided.
It's basically every special day
that's been in Chase's since 1995.
Thousands and thousands of entries.
And next to each one is the person who submitted it.
I've organized it alphabetically,
and I'm in the nationals.
She's reading down the list.
There's National S'mores Day.
National Soul Food Month,
National Soy Foods Month.
And then there it is.
National Splurge Day.
Do you wanna just read the text
that's accompanying this?
Uh, today is the day to go out
and do something extraordinarily indulgent.
Motto, have fun.
And do, and okay,
and so there is a name attached
with the creation of this particular day.
Yeah, Adrian Sue Coopersmith.
Adrian Sue Coopersmith.
National Splurge Day was not invented
by a chamber of commerce.
It was not passed during the Congressional holiday boom.
It was invented and then rescinded
by a woman named Adrian Sue Coopersmith.
And we had some questions for her.
Coming up, the last stop on our journey.
We meet the maker of National Splurge Day,
and it is not what we expected.
Our National Splurge Day quest
has taken us from a TV station in Sacramento
to lawmakers in Washington, D.C.,
to the holiday gatekeeper in Chicago, and now?
Chicago again.
Total coincidence.
But yep, it's where we're headed.
All right, I'm like a mile away.
I'm excited, I'm nervous,
I'm on my way to meet this woman.
It's kind of an old downtown.
Adrian Sue Coopersmith lives in an apartment building
in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago.
And when I get there,
she's already outside waiting for me
and very concerned about my lack of rain apparel.
Do you need plastic?
No, no, I'm okay.
Adrian's in her 60s.
She has long brown hair that she wears in braids.
She's very proudly a Leo.
She used to be a secretary
and did some freelance public relations work.
Do you want me to take my shoes off?
Oh, no.
So we settle in, we eat some cheesecake,
and she tells me the real story
behind National Splurge Day is this.
It was the 1990s, it was tax season,
and she was bummed.
And she thought, what is the silver lining here?
So you figure you're gonna have your tax return back
within two months and three days, okay?
You're gonna have time to think about the fact
that you want to splurge on something, okay?
God bless you.
That's my cat, my cat just sneezed.
I always say, God bless her because she's a little,
she's a darling.
Adrian decided that two months and three days
after tax day, that needs to be National Splurge Day.
So she wrote it up,
submitted it to Chase's calendar of events,
and it was a hit.
The thing is, National Splurge Day,
that is just the beginning of it.
Adrian, how many holidays have you created?
1,900 that are legally written down,
but there's more.
Yeah, okay.
Adrian took me a few blocks away
to a place called Uncle Bob's Storage.
All right.
She walks up to this 10 foot by 20 foot storage locker.
So this is the Empire.
Yeah.
In this warehouse is Adrian's life work.
Hundreds and hundreds of pages of holidays,
or as she calls them, holidays.
She's been making these things since the 1990s.
All right, let's go in.
We shimmy into a storage locker.
Oh, ow.
Let's see what this is.
She grabs a box, opens it up.
Let's see what we have.
This is a whole list of holidays right here.
I don't have my glasses on so I can't see.
Oh, do you want me to read?
Yeah.
This is your interview, dear.
Okay, let me read them to you.
Okay.
January 2nd, the Great Escape Day.
Yeah, okay.
January 16th, dealing with the dentist day.
February 6th, pack, pay a compliment day.
Oh yeah, that one was picked up
by Chase's calendar of events.
Really?
Pay a compliment day.
Oh yeah, that's big baby, that's big time.
Adrian doesn't remember all of these
because she only submits the best of her ideas to Chase's
and she's had around 20 of these picked up,
including National Hug a GI Day,
International Skeptics Day,
and Second Honeymoon Weekend.
There are a handful of people like Adrian
who are prolific holiday contributors to Chase's.
There's a guy who does pun holidays.
There's a couple in Pennsylvania
who are known for irreverent holidays.
But Adrian has her own style.
Her holidays fall somewhere between quirky and profound.
In fact, when I was visiting
the Chase's calendar editor, Holly.
Oh, Lost Penny Day.
She read to me one of her favorite Adrian holidays,
Lost Penny Day.
To put aside all those pennies stashed in candy dishes,
coffee cans, bowls, and jars,
back into circulation,
celebrated Abraham Lincoln's birthday.
I just think that's really charming.
It's a poetic little holiday.
Yeah, and very easy for anybody to celebrate.
You were sort of clutching your chest as you read that.
I don't always do that.
She sounds sad because Adrian's holidays
aren't in Chase's anymore.
About 10 years ago, she asked Holly to pull them out,
which is weird,
but Adrian had seen some of her holidays
show up in commercials to sell things
and she felt like she was losing control a little bit.
But I talked to Adrian for hours
and I actually think that there's a story
that helps explain why these holidays mean so much to her.
It starts in the 70s and she was dating this guy.
He was a gorgeous British guy.
He was about five years older than I was.
I mean, he was really, really,
the accent, the coolness, the appeal,
that kind of a thing, you know.
Adrian adored this guy, but it was a bad relationship.
He drank and she wanted him
to go into Alcoholics Anonymous.
He kind of did, but not really.
So they eventually broke up
when she found out later that he had died young.
Adrian says it was because of him
and this period of her life
that she started to think about events
in a completely different way.
AA is very similar to an event.
If you can make it through one day
and your event is not doing drugs or not drinking.
Then yeah, sure, that is an event,
but that's an event about absence,
about not doing something.
And there's all this pressure attached to it.
Will you fail?
Will you succeed?
So Adrian thought maybe it would be easier
or at least make people happier
if there was always another event to celebrate.
So I started thinking, what can you do
in lieu of doing something bad,
do something that's an event,
even if it's for a minute a day
to get you through that day
that pulls you away from what you're addicted by.
That's kind of beautiful, right?
Yeah, it is.
But there is a very real business machine
fueled by these made-up holidays.
PR people use them to get companies television time.
There's a book made up of these.
It sells for 75 bucks.
It's all true, it's all true.
It's just that I think the last thing
I expected to find at the bottom of this machine
were these little homemade holidays
and a woman who's not making money off of them,
but who cares about these more
than I knew anyone could ever care about a holiday.
So we're back at Adrian's storage locker
and we're still reading through that list
of her holiday dates.
June 18th, National Splurge Day.
That's it, baby, that's the big one.
Is that your Mona Lisa?
My Mona Lisa, probably, that and National Smith Day.
National Smith Day, that's to celebrate
something completely ordinary,
the last name Smith or Cooper Smith or whatever.
But there's other ones.
Adrian flips the page and there's this list
of holidays that just goes on forever.
See, there's a lot of-
I'm just gonna go fast.
Okay.
Ready?
July 2nd, take a starving artist out to lunch day.
July 9th, International Teen Idol Day.
July 16th, Sports Club Day.
July 23rd, Bell of the Ball Day.
July 30th, King Biscuit Day.
August 6th, National Aunt and Uncle Day.
Oh, that was a good one.
August 13th, National Cowards Day.
August 20th, Going Going Gone Day.
August 27th, Universal Doorman Day.
September 3rd, Hospital Tea Day.
September 10th, International Makeup Day.
That was Kenny Malone and Noelle King
