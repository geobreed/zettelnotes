After years of planning and months of production, the Planet Money T-shirts are here. They'll be in the mail soon. We promise. The shirts were touched by people in rich countries with advanced degrees and by people working for some of the lowest wages in the world. They traveled thousands of miles across three continents. Over the next several weeks, we'll tell the story of the shirts, and of the world behind them. Today, we begin at the beginning: where the cotton in our shirt came from.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

If you were to visit the PLANET MONEY offices, you would notice something strange. Tucked into corners around the office and in boxes underneath our desks are hundreds and hundreds of T-shirts. T-shirts in grey and pink, they have a squirrel on them holding a martini glass. These are the official PLANET MONEY T-shirts. And if you've been following the show for a while, you know that we actually manufactured this T-shirt ourselves. When I say that I don't mean we just put a logo on them, no. We actually partnered with a big apparel company called Jockey who helped us design and construct these T-shirts almost from scratch. And then we documented the whole process from start to finish.

What we found in these stories was that our T-shirt was touched by all these people around the world. They were people in rich countries with advanced degrees helping us with our T-shirt and some of the lowest-paid workers in the world. Our T-shirt, we estimated, traveled 20,000 miles, all these different countries, three different continents. And we brought all the stories to you. So this month, on Wednesdays, we are going to replay some of our favorite PLANET MONEY T-shirt stories. And as a special treat for you, if you stay tuned till the end, we will tell you how you can enter to win some of our extra T-shirts. We have really got to get these things out of the office.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

R. SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith. Today on the show, producer Jess Jiang and I travel around the world to search for the birthplace of the PLANET MONEY T-shirt - talking here about the cotton farm, the cotton field. Our T-shirt was made of 100 percent cotton, but tracing it back to the place where that was grown was this big mystery for us. It required a lot of detective work.

R. SMITH: Imagine going into a gas station. You've just filled up your car and going to the guy who works behind the counter and saying, hey, you know, I was just wondering, where did this gasoline come from? I mean, not the company, not Texaco or Exxon - whatever. I mean, exactly where was the well that produced the oil that got refined into my gasoline?

JESS JIANG, BYLINE: Or going to a car plant and asking them where did they mine the ore that made the steel that went into that car door.

R. SMITH: This is how we felt a few months ago when we started to ask a pretty basic question about the PLANET MONEY T-shirt - where is the farm? Where is the farm that made the cotton that made our T-shirt? And people just laughed when we asked this, even the Jockey corporation. Now, they're the company we're working with to make our T-shirt. They helped us find the factories and all the players, but even they couldn't tell us where the cotton came from. But they did - they did recommend a place that we could go to find the answer. It's a place halfway around the world - a factory in Indonesia called Indorama. And so we packed our bags, and we went.

JIANG: Anil Tibrewal, he's the chief sales guy at Indorama, and he met us at the factory gate.

R. SMITH: There is this sort of amazing smell here.

ANIL TIBREWAL: It's the cotton smell.

JIANG: It does smell natural.

TIBREWAL: This is natural. If you go to the cotton fields, pick up a ball, smell it. It's almost similar like this.

R. SMITH: A little bit like the earth where it came from.

Anil told us, come with me, I will show you where your cotton came from. And so he brought us into this warehouse - actually, it's like two warehouses, and they are giant. It is humid in there. It smells like yeast. And there are thousands of bales of cotton stacked all the way to the rafters. And there's little signs on each one that says where the cotton came from. And it's like the United Nations back there. You got Brazil. You got Greece. They happen to wrap their cotton bales in blue plastic, just like their flag.

JIANG: We also see giant columns of Australian cotton, columns that are two or three stories high.

R. SMITH: Anil said that he thought our cotton for our T-shirt probably was all the way in the back. And he brought us back there, and I got to say it came from a pretty surprising place.

JIANG: Is this from Arkansas?

TIBREWAL: Memphis. This is Memphis.

JIANG: Oh, Memphis.

R. SMITH: This is Charlotte, Charlotte. This is all...

TIBREWAL: This one the same lot. We won't...

R. SMITH: Is this Charlotte all the way up?

TIBREWAL: This whole lot of bales is American cotton.

R. SMITH: There's a little tag on each and every bale, and I see Marmaduke, Ark., Halls, Tenn., Lyon, Miss. It's like going on a road trip down along the Mississippi River Delta. Now, this, on the face of it, does not seem to make much economic sense because of all the countries in the world, there are hundreds of places that can grow cotton, any place that has warm weather and enough sun and the right soil. There are places that are much, much closer to Indonesia that can grow the cotton, places where the land is cheap, where the labor's cheaper. So why ship a bunch of cotton from the furthest place away that you can find from Indonesia? Why does this place get so much cotton from America? And guess what? They are ordering more every day.

ANUPAM AGRAWAL: Today, I have decided to buy 2,000 tons of American cotton - 4,214.

R. SMITH: Just today you did?

AGRAWAL: On the farm. Without even seeing the crop because the crop is only going to come out next year.

R. SMITH: That's Anupam Agrawal. He's a big boss around here. And to understand why in his eyes American cotton is king, you have to understand exactly what they do at this giant factory in Indonesia. Indorama is a spinning plant. They take raw cotton and they spin it into yarn.

JIANG: OK, yarn.

R. SMITH: Yarn (laughter).

JIANG: Whatever image you have in your head, just forget about it. Stop thinking about grandmas knitting scarves. Yarn in the textile business is the stuff you and I might call thread.

R. SMITH: But they do not call it thread.

JIANG: No, they yell at you whenever you call it thread. So look closely at your T-shirt. See those tiny, little lines? That is yarn. It's the stuff you knit or weave together to make fabric.

R. SMITH: And you can tell we're speaking about yarn in sort of an odd voice because yarn, once you look into it, is incredibly complicated. Randy Schelling is one of our advisers from Jockey. And he told us that when they design a T-shirt, they spend a lot of time creating the perfect yarn with just the right qualities.

RANDY SCHELLING: You have the twist, the amount of twist, the direction of the twist.

JIANG: They even specify fiber content and something called tenacity.

SCHELLING: Newtons per tex on the yarn. That's the relationship to the size of the yarn and the amount of strength.

R. SMITH: So that's if you tug on it, if it's going to break.

SCHELLING: Right.

R. SMITH: We asked Randy how many different kinds of yarn you could come up, and he said, basically, the number is infinite. So we asked him, what about the PLANET MONEY yarn? Can we have a copy of this spec sheet for the yarn, so that, you know, we could post it on our website, show you exactly what kind of yarn is in our T-shirt?

SCHELLING: No, I don't believe so (laughter).

MARION SMITH: That's our special sauce.

R. SMITH: That was Randy's boss, Marion Smith, at the end there. He says that yarn is a trade secret. They share it with nobody - not us, nobody. It's like the recipe for Coke, only so much softer on the skin.

JIANG: The reason all this obsession and secrecy about yarn is that yarn has to be perfect. There's six miles of it in your T-shirt.

R. SMITH: Six miles.

JIANG: And it all has to be exactly the same thickness, the same tenacity, the same strength or else the PLANET MONEY T-shirt would feel funny. It wouldn't fit right, and it would warp.

AGRAWAL: Creating the best possible yarns in the world, you need the best possible cotton.

R. SMITH: And this is why Anupam Agrawal - and everyone else here at Indorama - loves American cotton. It's the best - and I can say that as a Canadian. The American cotton is long. It is strong and fairly white - everything you want in a cotton. But more important to the folks around here, it is consistent. When you open bales of American cotton, you know exactly what you're getting. And that's important because Indorama makes all this perfect yarn with perfect robots, lots and lots of expensive robots. And as you may well know, robots hate anything that is not consistent. So Anil takes us into the plant, the plant itself. It's big as a football field. And there is hardly a worker inside. These are beautiful machines. They are, like, immaculate.

TIBREWAL: And very expensive.

R. SMITH: Very expensive, he says. And here's what all those machines do. The cotton gets sucked into sort of a long, thick rope. It's like an infinite ponytail. And this ponytail dips and swirls above our heads. And I reach out and grab a little bit of it - feels like cotton candy.

It's so light. And if you touch it, it almost falls apart it's so fragile.

And now the twist - literally, the twist. This ponytail starts to speed up, starts to spin and twist. And suddenly, this big, thick ponytail is very thin and extremely strong.

JIANG: Indorama puts out enough of this very strong yarn to make a T-shirt every second. That's enough yarn in a day to circle the globe 24 times.

R. SMITH: It took us a long time, but we did that calculation with Anil. Now, occasionally, this yarn will break, and this is where the few workers in the plant come in. There are these women. They have long headscarves. And they come up to the little, broken piece of yarn and they literally just sort of snap it with their fingers, and they twist the broken yarn pieces back together.

Other than the women who come and, like, pick up the thread and fix it, there is no human who touches this at all.

TIBREWAL: No, they are not touching here. Why should you touch the product by hands? You are destroying the product.

JIANG: But what's destroying it? My hands are clean. I washed them.

TIBREWAL: No, your hands are not clean. Dirty hands are bound to touch it. And then, look at this. The yarn is destroyed.

R. SMITH: So this goes to one of the big reasons that Anil chooses American cotton - Americans are just as obsessed with purity as the Indonesians are. And this may sound strange, but, if anything, the American farm is more high-tech than this Indonesian factory. And American cotton, if possible, is touched by fewer human hands - not even this guy.

BOWEN FLOWERS: My name is Bowen Flowers. We're standing on one of my farms we call Omega.

R. SMITH: This is Clarksdale, Miss. It's one of the towns that we got from the tags on the cotton bales back in Indonesia. It's the Mississippi Delta. It's the home of the blues, the guitarist Robert Johnson, and as far as we can estimate, we narrowed it down to generally this area. But this - we're going to call it now - this is the birthplace of the PLANET MONEY T-shirt.

JIANG: We're standing on Bowen's field, and it's just immense - white, white, white cotton all the way to the horizon. From afar, it kind of looks like snow.

R. SMITH: Yeah, except it's really hot out. We grabbed this bunch of cotton back at the warehouse in Indonesia when no one was looking, and we brought it back here to its ancestral home.

Can you identify it? Is that yours?

FLOWERS: (Laughter) Don't know but it looks like the same as all the cotton around this area. That's for sure.

R. SMITH: Bowen is one big farmer - in both senses of the word. He has 4,000 acres of cotton across several fields. That's one of the largest spreads in Mississippi. And he's also 6-foot-7. The plants only come up to his belt buckle. Now, when I started working on this story, I never really imagined that we grew this much cotton still in the United States. All of my images of cotton picking were from history - you know, plantations, slavery, sharecroppers living in little shacks at the edge of the field, handpicking cotton. That is not the way it works these days.

JIANG: This is the John Deere 7760. It has that iconic green color, and it's big as a house boat. Bowen bought five of them just last year, and they did not come cheap.

BOWEN FLOWERS: They right at 600,000 apiece. So we've got a big investment. We got to make something to try to make the payments on them every year.

R. SMITH: You bought $3 million worth of equipment last year to pick cotton?

FLOWERS: It's crazy, isn't it? Real crazy (laughter) we might need to have our brain examined (laughter).

JIANG: Bowen makes cotton the way Germans make luxury cars. It's high-tech. It's automated. It's GPS-tracked. These machines, they automatically pack the cotton into these huge cylinders the size of SUVs.

R. SMITH: One driver can do a hundred acres a day, which is something that they couldn't even dream of a few years ago. And Bowen can sit back and watch the progress and the statistics on a satellite map on his iPad.

FLOWERS: I could be at the house doing office work and check and see how they're doing.

R. SMITH: Even though it's a pretty sweltering day in Mississippi, Bowen never breaks a sweat. In fact, he never really gets out of his air-conditioned truck. He just drives around, looks at his iPad, talks to people through the window. And as cushy as it is for Bowen, for the farmer, the driver of the John Deere has an even sweeter gig.

MARTOVIA LATRELL JONES: Come on up.

R. SMITH: We're climbing up the ladder into picker number three to hitch a ride with Martovia Latrell Jones. Everyone calls him Toto.

JIANG: He was named after the dog from "Wizard Of Oz."

R. SMITH: Yeah, by his grandmother. And once we're all packed into the cockpit of this John Deere, Toto puts the machine into gear.

JONES: Whoa.

R. SMITH: And then Toto just let's go.

You just took your hands off the wheel. You don't even have to touch it.

JONES: Yeah, pretty much everything driving itself.

JIANG: OK, Robert, we kind of nerded out over this machine because it was so amazing. The picker feels the cotton plant and makes all the adjustments. And just like the workers in Indonesia, Toto just has to sit back and let the machine do its work. He can call his wife on the cellphone, eat his lunch, sing along to the blues station.

JONES: Y'all might not like my singing.

R. SMITH: Toto tells me he has a lot of time to think up here. He was raised by his grandfather named George Jones. And George worked on a cotton farm before all of this technology. George told him what it used to be like.

JONES: Had to get down on their hands and knees, get blisters and splinters in their fingernails and everything.

R. SMITH: You do realize that you probably harvest more in five minutes than he did all day long?

JONES: Yeah. I can make a round and pick more than they picked in their whole lifetime.

R. SMITH: And so up here in the John Deere 7760, it makes sense that the PLANET MONEY T-shirt is made out of American cotton. You can see how it's cleaner, how it's pristine, it's better quality, and there is one more thing that American cotton has going for it - it's not that much more expensive than cotton from incredibly poor countries. And this gets to the final reason why America exports more cotton than anyone else in the world. According to a lot of people, our competitors especially, the United States cheats. The United States stacks the deck, and we do that with a very complicated mix of subsidies and other kinds of support from the U.S. government. We called up Pietra Rivoli. She's been sort of an inspiration to us on this project. She's an economist. She wrote a book called "The Travels Of A T-shirt In The Global Economy." And she says that as much as possible, the U.S. government has taken most of the risk out of farming. And let's just think about that sentence for a little bit. Farming is one of the most risky businesses there is. I mean, it's in the Bible, right? Plagues, blights, droughts. The U.S. government basically has a program for every one of those.

PIETRA RIVOLI: There are bad things that can happen. Prices can fall. There can be too much rain. It can be too hot. It can be too cold. A lot of those risks are protected against by government programs, particularly insurance subsidies.

R. SMITH: So basically they give them cheap insurance.

RIVOLI: They give them cheap insurance.

R. SMITH: And as they say on the late-night infomercials, that's not all.

JIANG: The government, they also send a check.

R. SMITH: They send a check - straight out subsidy. It is a complicated formula. We went over all the books with Bowen Flowers, but we estimate that for the 4,000 acres of cotton that Bowen and his family farm this year, his operation could be expected to get around $100,000 in government support. And to be fair, other countries also support their agricultural products in various ways, but nobody - I got to say - does it as effectively as the United States of America, where you see subsidies and technology combining into this tightly linked team. It's almost an organism.

You know, you take, for example, the $600,000 John Deere pickers that Bowen bought. It's a huge investment. That would be risky for any small businessmen. But because the government has removed much of Bowen's others risks, he can not only buy the machine but also look at getting a larger farm to use all those machines on. And because Bowen is willing to make that investment, John Deere is willing to make new and better models every few years. And a bunch of guys in Indonesia get clean, consistent cotton at a bargain price.

Now, from the outside, this looks like a private market at work, but like a lot of so-called free markets in the United States, underneath it is your U.S. tax dollars, enabling the whole system to exist.

Back up in the cockpit of the John Deere cotton picker, Toto can watch his progress on this cool little computer screen. It tells you minute by minute how much cotton is coming off the plants. And the green lights mean that everything is going perfectly this fall. They're on track to harvest 6 billion pounds of cotton. That's enough cotton, in other words, just from one farm in Mississippi to make a T-shirt for every person in New York City.

JONES: Once it leave here, I know it goes, like, maybe a thousand different places before it becomes a T-shirt. So I would like to just see that one day, just, you know, see where all the - what all other happens after it leaves the cotton gin.

JIANG: We told Toto about Indonesia and all the robots and the miles and miles of yarn and how the project will follow the yarn in Indonesia to the sewing in Bangladesh and to Colombia.

R. SMITH: And when you finally get the PLANET MONEY T-shirt you ordered, you know, this part of the process, the cotton, the spinning, it becomes invisible because no T-shirt ever on the label says oh, born in the fields of Mississippi or spun in Indonesia. Anupam Agrawal, the boss back at Indorama, he says this part is occasionally frustrating.

AGRAWAL: You would never imagine how much effort, investment and time is spent in creating a quality which you just go and pick up, you know? When I see people picking up a T-shirt and then just putting it back in the shelf in a store, I thought, hey, man, we worked very hard to make that yarn which has made that T-shirt. So come on, give it some respect.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CLOTH")

COMMON: (Rapping) Let's shake off the dust from the cloth. Oh, you're worried about when people stop and stare. That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear.

R. SMITH: We're always interested to hear what you think of the program. You can email us at planetmoney@npr.org. And for those of you who listened this whole time just to win a free T-shirt, or perhaps you fast forwarded to the end - very sneaky - here's how you do it - email us at the address I just gave you - planetmoney@npr.org - and write the word cotton in the subject line - C-O-T-T-O-N. We'll pick, like, say, 10 entries at random, so make sure you have your name in the email and the size of T-shirt that you would like and whether you would like it to be the men's or the women's T-shirt, gray or pink. And I should say we cannot afford to send this overseas - I'm so sorry - so domestic entrants only.

JIANG: Find us on Facebook, Twitter, Spotify; I'm Jess Jiang.

R. SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CLOTH")

COMMON: (Rapping) Yeah, that's the thread that helps us move ahead. You hunger for affection will always be fed. Thank God we never sped. Let love take its course. It's what's inside of us, no need to outsource the cloth. Oh, you're worried about when people stop and stare. That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear. Cut from the same cloth you just want to wear. But that's just a tear.

**faster whisper:**
Hey, it's Alex Bloomberg here and I have something very very exciting in my hands. I am holding the Planet Money t-shirt
That's right. The actual Planet Money t-shirt. It's the ladies shirt sheer rose pink picture of the squirrel with Martini on the cover
It looks beautiful. It is a very proud moment for all of us. We've been talking about this t-shirt now for a long time
We've done a bunch of shows and the planning of the making of our t-shirt. We've been following how our t-shirt gets put together
We've been going around the globe
Reporting on those stories for the last six months and now we have them in our hot little hands
And we're gonna be sending these t-shirts to those of you who ordered them very very soon
They should be arriving starting the week of Thanksgiving and as promised we are going to be spending the next couple of weeks
Telling the story of how this t-shirt came into being
Our t-shirt was touched by people all over the world people in rich countries with advanced degrees
People working for some of the lowest wages in the world
It traveled over 20,000 miles to all these different countries three different continents and we will take you to all of them
For example, the women's shirt was sewn in South America in Colombia where Marianne McCune was there to see it
This is your t-shirt. It says Planet Money, Planet Money, Planet Money
What is Planet Money? Planet Money is the name of our show. Ah, okay. They show in the in the radio
The world will soon know our name people
The men's shirt was manufactured in Bangladesh where Caitlyn Kenney was there and found that the garment industry is so huge there
That English garment words have entered the language words like side seam and silhouette. I seem silhouette as
Planet Money
That's the name of our show
These are our t-shirts
Containerships hauled our shirts and the materials they were made from all around the globe and Jacob Goldstein was there when the shirts finally arrived
on American soil in Miami
They made it Planet Money women's t-shirts are here
And trust me that's as excited as Jacob gets and we are going to take you to all of those places
Hear all of those stories. But before all that, of course, it's the place where our shirt was born
Our t-shirts are a hundred percent cotton and today in the very first installment of our t-shirt series here on the show
Where our cotton came from now?
We thought this would be a pretty easy question to answer but it turns out even when you make the shirt yourself
Tracking your shirt back to the cotton field where it was born is really difficult
Robert Smith and Jess Jang were on team cotton and
Finding the place where our cotton came from was sort of like solving a mystery for them
It took a lot of detective work take it away guys
Imagine going into a gas station. You've just filled up your car and going to the guy who works behind the counter and saying hey
You know, I was just wondering where did this gasoline come from? I mean not the company not Texaco or Exxon whatever
I mean exactly where was the well that produced the oil that got refined into my gasoline or going to a car plant and
Asking them where did they mine the ore that made the steel that went into that car door?
This is how we felt a few months ago when we started to ask a pretty basic question about the Planet Money t-shirt
Where is the farm?
Where is the farm that made the cotton that made our t-shirt and people just laughed when we asked this even the jockey
Corporation now they're the company we're working with to make our t-shirt
They helped us find the factories and all the players
But even they couldn't tell us where the cotton came from
But they did they did recommend a place that we could go to find the answer
it's a place halfway around the world a factory in Indonesia called
Indorama and so we packed our bags and we went
Anil Tiburwal, he's the chief sales guy at Indorama and he met us at the factory gate. There is this amazing
Smell here. It's the cotton smell. It does smell natural. This is natural if you go to the cotton fields
Pick up a ball
Smell it. It's almost similar like this a little bit like the earth where it came from and Neil told us come with me
I will show you where your cotton came from and so he brought us into this warehouse
Actually, it's like two warehouses and they are giant. It is humid in there
It smells like yeast and there are thousands of bales of cotton stacked all the way the rafters and there's little signs
On on each one that says where the cotton came from and it's like the United Nations back there
You got Brazil you got Greece they happen to wrap their cotton bales in blue plastic just like their flag
We also see giant columns of Australian cotton columns that are two or three stories high
Anil said that he thought our cotton for our t-shirt
Probably was all the way in the back and he brought us back there and I got to say
It came from a pretty surprising place. Is this from Arkansas Memphis? This is Memphis. Oh Memphis. This is Charlotte
Charlotte this is all
Is this Charlotte all the way up this whole lot of bales is American cotton
There's a little tag on each and every bail and I see Marmaduke, Arkansas Halls, Tennessee
Lion, Mississippi. It's like going on a road trip down along the Mississippi River Delta now
This on the face of it does not seem to make much economic sense because of all the countries in the world
There are hundreds of places that can grow cotton any place that has warm weather and enough sun and the right
Soil there are places that are much much closer to Indonesia that can grow the cotton places where the land is cheap
Where the labor is cheaper?
So why ship a bunch of cotton from the furthest place away that you can find from Indonesia?
Why does this place get so much cotton from America and guess what they're ordering more every day today?
I have decided to buy 2,000 tons of American cotton for
2014 just today you did on the phone without even seeing the crop because the crop is only going to come out next year
That's Anupam Agrawal
He's a big boss around here and to understand why in his eyes American cotton is king
You have to understand exactly what they do at this giant factory in Indonesia
Indorama is a spinning plant. They take raw cotton and they spin it into yarn. Okay yarn yarn
Whatever image you have in your head just forget about it. Stop thinking about grandma's knitting scarves
Yarn in the textile business is the stuff you and I might call thread, but they do not call it thread
No, they yell at you whenever you call it thread. So look closely at your t-shirt. See those tiny little lines
That is yarn

You need the best possible cotton and this is why Anupam Agrawal and everyone else here to Indorama loves American cotton
It's the best and I can say that as a Canadian. The American cotton is long
It is strong and fairly white everything you want in a cotton
But more important to the folks around here. It is consistent when you open bales of American cotton
You know exactly what you're getting and that's important because Indorama makes all this perfect yarn with perfect
Robots lots and lots of expensive robots and as you may well know robots hate anything that is not consistent
So Anil takes us into the plant the plant itself. It's big as a football field and there is hardly a worker inside
These are beautiful machines. They are like immaculate
Very expensive he says and here's what all those machines do the cotton it's sucked into sort of a long thick rope
It's like an infinite ponytail and this ponytail dips and swirls above our heads and I
Reach out and grab a little bit of it feels like cotton candy
It's so light and if you if you touch it it almost falls apart
It's so fragile and now the twist
Literally the twist this ponytail starts to speed up start to spin and twist and suddenly this big thick ponytail is very thin and
Extremely strong
Indorama puts out enough of this very strong yarn to make a t-shirt every second
That's enough yarn in a day to circle the globe 24 times
It took us a long time, but we did that calculation with a kneel now
Occasionally this yarn will break and this is where the few workers in the plant come in there
These women they have long head scarves and they come up to the little broken piece of yarn
And they literally just sort of snap it with their fingers and they twist the broken yarn pieces back together
Other than the women who come in like pick up the thread and and fix it
There is no human who touches this at all. No, they are not touching here. Why should you touch the product by hands?
You are destroying the product
But what's destroying it? My hands are clean. I wash them
No, your hands are not clean dirty hands are bound to touch it and then look at this. The yarn is destroyed
So this goes to one of the big reasons that an eel chooses American cotton
Americans are just as obsessed with purity as the Indonesians are and this may sound strange
but if anything the American farm is more high-tech than this Indonesian factory an
American cotton if possible is touched by fewer human hands not even this guy. Okay. My name is Bowen flowers
We're standing on one of my farms we call
Omega this is Clarksdale, Mississippi. It's one of the towns that we got from the tags on the cotton bales back in Indonesia
It's the Mississippi Delta. It's the home of the Blues the guitarist Robert Johnson
And as far as we can estimate we narrowed it down to generally this area
But this we're gonna call it now. This is the birthplace of the Planet Money t-shirt
We're standing on Bowen's field and it's just immense white white white cotton all the way to the horizon from afar
It kind of looks like snow
Yeah, except it's really hot out
We grabbed this bunch of cotton back at the warehouse in Indonesia when no one was looking and we brought it back here
To its ancestral home. Can you identify it? Is that yours?
Don't know but it looks like the same as all the cotton around this area
Bowen is one big farmer in both senses of the word
He has 4,000 acres of cotton across several fields
That's one of the largest spreads in Mississippi and he's also six foot seven
The plants only come up to his belt buckle now when I started working on this story, I never really
Imagined that we grew this much cotton still in the United States all of my images of cotton picking were from history
You know plantations slavery shear croppers living in little shacks at the edge of the field hand-picking cotton
That is not the way it works these days
This is the John Deere
7760 it had that iconic green color and it's big as a houseboat
Bowen bought five of them just last year and they did not come cheap
They're right at six hundred thousand a piece
So we've gotten a big investment we got to make something to try to make to make the payments on them every year
You bought three million dollars worth of equipment last year to pick cotton. It's crazy, isn't it?
Real crazy. We might need to have our brain examined
Bowen makes cotton the way Germans make luxury cars. It's high-tech. It's automated
It's GPS tracked these machines they automatically pack the cotton into these huge cylinders the size of
SUVs one driver can do a hundred acres a day
Which is something that they couldn't even dream of a few years ago
And Bowen can sit back and watch the progress and the statistics on a satellite map on his iPad
I could be at the house doing doing office work and check and see how they're doing
Even though it's a pretty sweltering day in Mississippi Bowen never breaks a sweat
In fact, he never really gets out of his air-conditioned truck
He just drives around looks at his iPad talks to people through the window and as cushy as it is for Bowen for the
Farmer the driver of the John Deere has an even sweeter gig
We're climbing up the ladder into picker number three to hitch a ride with Martovia Luttrell Jones
Everyone calls him Toto. He was named after the dog from Wizard of Oz
Yeah by his grandmother and once we're all packed into the cockpit of this John Deere Toto puts the machine into gear
Whoa, and then Toto just let's go. You just took your hands off the wheel. You don't even have to touch it
Okay, Robert we kind of nerded out over this machine because it was so amazing
The picker feels the cotton plant and makes all the adjustments
And just like the workers in Indonesia Toto just has to sit back and let the machine do its work
He can call his wife on the cell phone eat his lunch sing along to the Blue Station. Y'all might not like my singing
Toto tells me he has a lot of time to think up here
He was raised by his grandfather named George Jones and George worked on a cotton farm before all of this technology
George told him what it used to be like
Had to get out on their hands and knees get blisters and splinters in their fingernails and everything
You do realize that you probably harvest more in five minutes than he did all day long
Yeah, I can make a round and pick more than they picked in their whole lifetime
And so up here in the John Deere
7760 it makes sense that the Planet Money t-shirt is made out of American cotton
You can see how it's cleaner how it's pristine
It's better quality and there is one more thing that American cotton has going for it
It's not that much more expensive than cotton from incredibly poor countries
And this gets to the final reason why America exports more cotton than anyone else in the world
According to a lot of people our competitors, especially
The United States cheats the United States stacks the deck and we do that with a very complicated mix of subsidies
And other kinds of support from the US government. We called up Pietra Rivoli. She's been sort of an inspiration to us on this project
She's an economist
she wrote a book called the travels of a t-shirt in the global economy and she says that as much as
Possible the US government has taken most of the risk out of farming and let's just think about that sentence
For a little bit farming is one of the most risky businesses there is I mean it's in the Bible right plagues
blights droughts
The US government basically has a program for every one of those
There are bad things that can happen prices can fall there can be too much rain it can be too hot
It can be too cold. A lot of those risks are protected
Against by government programs, particularly insurance subsidies. So basically they give them cheap insurance
They give them cheap insurance and as they say on the late-night infomercials. That's not all the government
They also send a check. They send a check straight-out subsidy. It is a complicated formula
We went over all the books with Bowen flowers
But we estimate that for the 4,000 acres of cotton that Bowen and his family farm this year
His operation could be expected to get around a hundred thousand dollars in government support as for next year
It could be a whole different story right now in Congress. They're debating the newest farm bill and
Farm subsidies. They're definitely on the chopping block. I don't really know what's gonna happen
But if we hadn't had it in the past, I know it wouldn't be cotton in this area and to be fair other countries also support
their agricultural products in various ways
But nobody I got to say does it as effectively as the United States of America where you see subsidies and technology
Combining into this tightly linked team. It's almost an organism
You know you take for example the $600,000 John Deere pickers that Bowen bought
It's a huge investment that would be risky for any small businessman
But because the government has removed much of Bowen's other risks
you can not only buy the machine but also look at getting a larger farm to use all those machines on and
Because Bowen is willing to make that investment
John Deere is willing to make new and better models every few years and a bunch of guys in Indonesia
Get clean consistent cotton and a bargain price
Now from the outside this looks like a private market at work
But like a lot of so-called free markets in the United States underneath it is your US tax dollars
enabling the whole system to exist
Back up in the cockpit of the John Deere cotton picker Toto can watch his progress on this cool little computer screen
It tells you minute by minute how much cotton is coming off the plants and the green lights mean that everything is going
Perfectly this fall they're on track to harvest six million pounds of cotton
That's enough cotton in other words just from one farm in Mississippi to make a t-shirt for every person in New York City
Once it leaves here, I know it goes or like maybe a thousand different places before it becomes a t-shirt
So I would like to just see it one day
Just you know see where all the where all of it happens after it leaves the cotton gin
we told Toto about Indonesia and all the robots and the miles and miles of yarn and how the project will follow the yarn in
Indonesia to the sewing in Bangladesh and to Colombia and when you finally get the planet mighty t-shirt you ordered
You know this part of the process the cotton the spinning it becomes invisible because no t-shirt ever on the label says
Oh born in the fields of Mississippi or spun in Indonesia and upon Agrawal the boss back at Indorama
He says this part is occasionally frustrating. You would never imagine
how much of effort investment and
Time is spent in creating a quality which you just go and pick up
You know when I see people picking up a t-shirt and then just putting it back in the in the shelf in a store
I said hey, man
We worked very hard
To make that yarn which has made that t-shirt. So come on give it some respect
The next stop in our t-shirts journey is
Bangladesh so we chase and Caitlin Kenny traveled there and they have a really amazing story of
Two women sisters who left a rural village and went to Chittagong in Bangladesh to manufacture our t-shirt
We'll have their story next time in the meantime. We are always interested to hear what you think of the program
