On today's show, we talk to commodities traders to answer one of the most important questions in finance: What actually happens at the end of Trading Places? We know something crazy happens on the trading floor. We know that Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd get rich and the Duke brothers lose everything. But how does it all happen? And could it happen in the real world? Also on the show: The "Eddie Murphy Rule" that wound up in the the big financial overhaul law Congress passed in 2010.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Back in the 1980s, Louis Winthorpe III was a big deal in the world of futures trading. He worked at a fancy firm in Philadelphia, and this guy knew commodities.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

DAN AYKROYD: (As Louis Winthorpe III) Pork bellies. I have a hunch something very exciting is going to happen in the pork belly market this morning.

ROMAN MARS: Louis was the best. He was about to get married and the future looked bright.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

AYKROYD: (As Louis Winthorpe III) We are going to make a great couple. We're going to have a great life.

MARS: Until his bosses, Randolph and Mortimer Duke, took all of that away from him.

SMITH: And so begins the great parable about what happens when the rich become poor, the poor become rich and a con man inherits the Earth.

(SOUNDBITE OF WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART'S "THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO")

SMITH: The movie is "Trading Places." Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith.

MARS: And I'm Roman Mars.

SMITH: Looking good, Roman.

MARS: Feeling good, Robert.

SMITH: Roman Mars is the host of the podcast "99 Percent Invisible." It's about all things design and architecture. And he's on PLANET MONEY today because he had an actual question for us about this movie.

MARS: Well, I love this movie. I saw it when I was way, way too young. I was probably 9 or 10. And I just wanted to know, is this the most sophisticated depiction of the inner workings of a financial market in the history of cinema?

SMITH: That is the perfect question for us, Roman Mars, because we have the ability and we shall bring in an entire panel of experts in the commodities and futures trading world to fact check this movie. Today on PLANET MONEY, what the movie "Trading Places" can teach you about financial markets. And - I know this is of particular interest to you, Roman - we are finally going to explain one of the great enduring mysteries, what the hell actually happened at the end of this crazy movie.

MARS: Oh, I definitely need that.

(SOUNDBITE OF WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART'S "THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO")

MARS: So if it's been a while since you've seen "Trading Places," everything is going really well for Louis Winthorpe until his bosses, they have an argument about nature versus nurture. And the evil Randolph Duke bets his maybe even slightly more evil brother Mortimer Duke that he can take away Louis' job and his fiance and his home and his friends and they can turn him into a criminal.

SMITH: While at the same time, the Duke brothers take a con man from the street named Billy Ray Valentine, he's played by Eddie Murphy, and they give him Louis' entire life - his job, his home, his butler - and they try to turn him into a hot-shot commodities broker. It's kind of a, you know, modern-day twist on "Prince And The Pauper."

MARS: Eventually, the two guinea pigs, they find each other. And Louis and Billy Ray conspire to get back at the Dukes. And they make a brilliant plan to make themselves really rich and put the Duke brothers in the poorhouse at the same time.

SMITH: It is a crazy, complicated plan that involves futures trading on commodities and quartering the market and frozen concentrated orange juice.

MARS: Right there, that's my first question, frozen concentrated orange juice is central to the movie. And when I first saw it, I totally thought that was made up as a commodity just to be funny. In the real world, my thinking was you would just trade oranges.

SMITH: Sure, yeah.

MARS: Who would spend their lives trading little cans of frozen concentrated orange juice?

SMITH: I found somebody - this guy.

TOM PERONIS: My name is Tom Peronis, and I'm a commodity trader. I'm just coming back from the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where I, you know, spent the last four hours buying and selling orange juice options and futures.

MARS: It's real.

SMITH: (Laughter) It's totally real. This guy does it all day long. So Tom Peronis, he's going to be our first expert on all things frozen and all things orange. And we'll meet our second expert in just a moment. But we're going to use both of them to fact check this premise that you had, Roman, that "Trading Places" basically could be a university-level course in finance and commodities. And as someone who explains economics for a living, I mean, this is my job. I take my hat off to the writers of this movie. Just listen to this scene.

The Duke brothers, in this scene, lead Eddie Murphy, Billy Ray Valentine, to a table. And set on that table is a beautiful breakfast.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

EDDIE MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) No thanks, guys, I already had breakfast this morning.

DON AMECHE: (As Mortimer Duke) This is not a meal, Valentine. We are here to try to explain to you what it is we do here.

RALPH BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) We are commodities brokers, William. Now, what are commodities? Commodities are agricultural products, like coffee that you had for breakfast, wheat, which is used to make bread, pork bellies, which is used to make bacon, which you might find in a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich.

SMITH: (Laughter) At this point, Eddie Murphy just deadpans right into the camera. I suspect that sometimes PLANET MONEY listeners feel the same way when we're explaining this to them.

MARS: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) And then there are other commodities like frozen orange juice and gold. Though of course, gold doesn't grow on trees like oranges (laughter). Clear so far?

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) Yeah.

BOB LASSANDRELLO: And reviewing the movie, they really, really did a good job. I mean, someone on that team knew what they were doing.

SMITH: This is our second expert, Bob Lassandrello. He's a commodities trader in Chicago. He used to trade cattle futures, like, Roman, you might find in a roast beef, cheddar and tomato sandwich.

MARS: Of course, if you watch that scene, you might think that these guys trade in physical things, the physical things that you see on the table, the bacon, the wheat, the cans of orange juice. But Tom Peronis says that in the orange juice market, that's not quite right.

PERONIS: Yeah, it's definitely not stored just in little cans. Yeah, they probably have large refrigerator-type units for them.

SMITH: Wait, what do you mean probably? You buy and sell this stuff. You have no idea what it looks like?

PERONIS: No, and as a matter of fact, if you trade agricultural commodities, most commodity traders go their whole careers without ever seeing the physical product. I mean, I used to trade pork bellies and live hogs. And I wouldn't know a pork belly if it dropped on the table here.

SMITH: Yeah, the reason Tom Peronis wouldn't recognize a pork belly on the table is because people like him who do this in real life are trading contracts on pork bellies or technically the future promise to deliver a certain amount of pork bellies at a certain time at a certain price.

MARS: What it really is is it's a wager. It's a bet on whether you think something is going to go up or down in price. And Mortimer and Randolph Duke in the movie - they make money whether it goes up or down.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) And the good part, William, is that no matter whether our clients make money or lose money, Duke & Duke get the commissions.

AMECHE: (As Mortimer Duke) Well, what do you think, Valentine?

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) Well, it sounds to me like you guys are a couple of bookies.

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) I told you he'd understand.

SMITH: I know this whole contracts thing may seem theoretical. But the bets are based on an actual contract about an actual, real thing. The traders just hold the contract for just a few minutes or a few days, enough time to make a little money. But before the contract expires, and the actual good has to be delivered, that trader needs to unload the contract, needs to sell it to someone who actually wants the thing underneath the contract, who actually wants the oranges, who wants the bacon, who wants the live cows. Remember, that's what Bob Lassandrello traded in, live cattle futures. And he didn't want a cow. He just wanted to make a bet on the future prices of cows. But, once, Bob did screw up.

Did you ever receive an actual cow?

LASSANDRELLO: Oh, boy, did I.

SMITH: Did you really?

LASSANDRELLO: Yeah. Not a cow - 40 of them - more than 40.

SMITH: You made a mistake.

LASSANDRELLO: Yes.

SMITH: You made a mistake, and somebody called you on the phone and just said, we have cattle here for you? What, are they on a truck or something?

LASSANDRELLO: Oh, yeah. Or they're in the pen. They're actually off the truck and in the pen - is what it is. And so when the guys in East St. Louis Stockyards found out that a futures trader took delivery on some cattle, they generally aren't super hopeful about - they don't really give you a hand, letting you sell them. They kind of stick you with some extra fees. And, you know, they don't like us guys - they didn't, at that time, like us guys sort of meddling in their world.

MARS: Now back to the movie. Billy Ray Valentine, who's now called William Valentine by the Dukes, is learning this commodities world. And it turns out he has some talent for it because it's not just about knowing the facts and the figures of the contracts and the commodities. A lot of it is about knowing psychology.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) Tell me just why you think the price of pork bellies is going down, William.

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) It's Christmas time. Everybody's up tight.

AMECHE: (As Mortimer Duke) Could we please, by now, Randolph...

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) All right. But if you want to lose money, go ahead.

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) What are you trying to say, William?

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) OK. Pork-belly prices have been dropping all morning, which means everybody's sitting in their office, and they're waiting for them to hit rock bottom so they can buy cheap and go along. So people that own the pork-belly contracts are going batshit 'cause they're thinking, hey, we're losing all our damn money. And Christmas is around the corner. And I ain't going to have no money to buy my son the G.I. Joe with the Kung Fu grip, OK? And my wife ain't going to want to - my wife ain't going to make love to me 'cause I ain't got no money, right? So they're sitting there, and they're panicking. They're screaming (shouting) sell, sell because they don't want to lose all their money, right. They're out there panicking right now. I can feel it. They're out there. They're panicking. Look at them.

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) He's right, Mortimer. My God, look at it.

MURPHY: (As Billy Ray Valentine) I'd wait until you get to about 64. Then I'd buy. You've cleared out all the suckers by then.

MARS: Of course, Billy Ray Valentine makes them a ton of money. But Bob Lassandrello has this small quibble with this scene. He says people don't really declare a particular price for a commodity. No one ever says it's going to 64. They don't really know exactly. But people make bets on whether things just go up and down.

SMITH: Is that right?

LASSANDRELLO: Oh, absolutely.

SMITH: Do people just have hunches that...

LASSANDRELLO: Absolutely. I mean, what would happen is, you know, there are guys who would just - you'd be standing around, and you'd start to have a feeling that the market was going to go up or down. And then you would trade accordingly. It's sort of like your brain processing all this information ends up manifesting itself as what's called a feel. And then you buy, or you sell, accordingly.

SMITH: So far, according to our experts, the movie "Trading Places" is nailing it. They have this commodities thing down pat. But then it gets a little Hollywood. Louis Winthorpe, our down-and-out rich boy, he teams up with his former butler and a prostitute with a heart of gold. We did not fact-check that one.

MARS: You don't even need to.

SMITH: Yeah (laughter).

MARS: It's a given.

SMITH: Exactly. Billy Ray, the con man-turned-trading savant, figures out, wait a minute. I'm being played. And he joins up with Winthorpe and they hatch this plan to make millions of dollars and bankrupt the Dukes.

MARS: And it's the end of the movie where I have my biggest questions. When I was a kid, I saw it - and I know that something important is happening on the trading floor at the end, that the underdogs win, they get rich, the Dukes go bankrupt. But I didn't really understand it. And when I watch it again, the funny thing is I still don't really understand it as an adult.

SMITH: And, you know, before I joined PLANET MONEY, I don't think I would have gotten it either. But I have now studied this movie over again. We've talked to the experts. And we are going to break this thing down because, Roman, if you were paying attention, this movie has already taught you everything you need to know about commodities and how to corner the market. Now, remember the orange juice that was in the breakfast scene?

MARS: Yes. Frozen concentrated orange juice.

SMITH: OK. So in the movie, the Duke brothers have bribed a guy to get an advance copy of the - this never happens in movies - advance copy of the USDA orange crop report, which is a totally real thing. These crop reports come out every month. They tell you how much of a commodity is out there. Now, this, if they know it in advance, how many oranges are out there, they will then know whether the price is going to go up or down.

MARS: And that part I understand. The crop report is going to say that the supply of oranges is fine, that there's plenty of good, cheap orange juice to go around.

SMITH: Yeah, it's a normal day in the market. Except our heroes are going to trick the Duke brothers. They're going to pull the old switcheroo. So they slip the brothers a fake crop report, a report that says, oh, my God, there was this terrible frost in Florida. Lots of dead oranges. The fake report would make any savvy trader know that the price of orange juice is going to go through the roof.

MARS: So the Duke Brothers think that the supply is low...

SMITH: Yep.

MARS: ...And the price is going to go up.

SMITH: Yep.

MARS: And they're willing to bet everything on it. And they are so wrong.

SMITH: They are so wrong. Our heroes, Billy Ray Valentine and Louis Winthorpe - that's the former trader who got screwed by the Dukes - they know the truth. They know that the orange supply is fine. And they know that the price is going to go down.

MARS: So let's bring back our OJ expert, Tom Peronis. And we're going to watch this final scene together and get a play-by-play.

SMITH: Our heroes, with their stolen insider information - our heroes are striding out onto the trading floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

PERONIS: There's (laughter) my old place of employment.

SMITH: That's the World Trade Center.

PERONIS: Yeah, and it's - I had an office in that building right there. That's where the exchange was.

MARS: Inside, you see all the traders in their ugly vests gathering on this large floor, staring up at the clock.

(SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER, CROSSTALK)

MARS: And it's pandemonium. Tom says this is exactly what it was like before computers. Maybe not quite so many people excited about frozen orange juice, but still.

PERONIS: It does make me nostalgic for floor-based trading.

SMITH: Now, once again - Roman, you've got to to keep all these things in your head if this is going to make sense - the Duke Brothers think there's going to be a shortage of oranges because according to their fake crop report, the harvest will be bad, so prices should go up. They tell their guy, their floor trader...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) We want you to buy as much OJ as you can the instant trading starts.

AMECHE: (As Mortimer Duke) Don't worry if the price starts going up, just keep buying.

SMITH: The price starts at $1.02 a pound, and as the Duke Brothers buy, the price starts to go up and up. They are bidding up the price of orange juice.

MARS: And the rest of the traders start to notice.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Hey, hey, the Dukes are trying to corner the market.

JACK DAVIDSON: (As Trader #3) They know something, I can feel it. Let's get in on it.

SMITH: OK. I got to tell you here, Roman, the actor who says, they know something, I can feel it, that is Jack Davidson, father of PLANET MONEY's very own Adam Davidson. And as Adam will say, it really is the most critical line in the entire movie delivered by his father.

MARS: (Laughter) That's amazing.

SMITH: But it is actually important for the plot because everyone starts to buy oranges. The price goes higher and higher - $1.10, $1.20, $1.30. Everyone now thinks there is an orange shortage. The only problem is, of course, we know as the audience that it's based on a lie. So Billy Ray Valentine, Louis Winthorpe stand quietly in the madness of the trading floor around them. They know the price is too high. They know it's getting higher, and they know it's about to collapse. And so they want to do a little trick you may have heard of called short selling. They want to sell orange juice while the price is high. So when the price hits 142, Dan Aykroyd looks up and he screams...

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

AYKROYD: (As Louis Winthorpe III) Sell 30 April at 142.

MARS: And I think this is a good candidate for the second most important line of the movie, with all respect to Jack Davidson, and I totally missed it. I've rewatched that movie again and again. I have no idea what he says there, what Dan Aykroyd says there. So we had Tom explain.

PERONIS: Sell 30 April at 142.

SMITH: What's he doing?

PERONIS: He's selling 30 futures contracts at a price of 142 per pound. And there's kind of a feeding frenzy driving the market higher, but these guys have what they believe is the real information and they're selling into that rally.

SMITH: So selling into the rally means you think the price is going to go down.

PERONIS: Yes.

MARS: All right, so I'm starting to get this. Billy Ray and Louis, they're selling high. They're selling orange juice to everyone who thinks that it's going to go even higher than that.

SMITH: Yeah. It's a really tricky fine point here, but I'm just going to out-and-out say this. You don't have to own any orange juice in order to sell it because - I know, it's weird - they are selling a promise. They're selling - they're saying, I will promise to deliver you orange juice in April - that was the April part of that - and you will pay me this large amount of money sometime in the future. Our heroes have until then to find some cheap orange juice and to fulfill their contracts. You've heard of the old saying, like, buy low and sell high.

MARS: Yes. That one I know.

SMITH: It's - it turns out, though - and this is the key to short selling. The key to the entire movie is you can do it the other way. You can sell high first and then turn around quickly and buy low, make a ton of money. And our heroes are about to get to buy extremely low because the crop report, the real crop report, is about to come out. And it's kind of crazy because everyone on the trading floor just stops and looks at the TV.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

MAURICE COPELAND: (As Secretary of Agriculture) Ladies and gentlemen, the orange crop estimates for the next year.

SMITH: And, I mean, this is obviously a Hollywood moment. Traders don't really just stare at the TV. And there's not a long, awkward pause while the secretary of agriculture comes on.

MARS: This is dramatic tension, Robert.

SMITH: It is. I think he's putting on his glasses and everything.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

COPELAND: (As Secretary of Agriculture) After calculating the estimates from various orange-producing states, we have concluded the following. The cold winter has apparently not affected the orange harvest.

(CROSSTALK)

SMITH: (Laughter) Listen to that.

MARS: That sound you hear is a bunch of people who just realized that they bet the wrong way. That there's no shortage, that the Dukes and everyone who bought with them, including Adam's dad, now own a lot of very expensive orange juice. Way too expensive. And now that the real crop report is out, the price is dropping. It's 102, 96, it's plunging to 72, 64. Everyone who bought high now wants to sell and cut their losses, and that's driving the price down even further. It's now at 46.

SMITH: And remember, our heroes knew this was going to happen. They sold a ton of orange juice at a crazy high price and now the entire trading floor, including the Duke brothers, the entire floor is begging to sell them orange juice for crazy cheap.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, unintelligible) Selling.

SMITH: Now, here's where our heroes sit as the chaos clears. Other people have promised to buy orange juice from them at a price as high as 142 a pound, 142, and now minutes later people are promising to sell orange juice to them as cheap as 29 cents a pound. Billy Ray and Louis get to pocket the difference.

PERONIS: It is a epic move, probably a significantly bigger one-day move than the orange juice market has ever had in its entire history. A purely fictional move, but, you know, enough to enable these guys to retire handsomely.

MARS: We had our commodities guys watch this pretty closely, but it's hard to estimate just how much money Billy Ray and Louis made on this scam. We see the price of orange juice futures, but not how many contracts. All we know at the end of the movie is that the Duke brothers, they are bankrupt.

SMITH: Yeah, they bought all of that orange juice when it was at crazy high prices. They bought high. And if and when they sell it, it's going to be at terribly low prices. They did the opposite of what you need to do to make money in the market.

MARS: They lost nearly $400 million. And the way trading works, our heroes probably pocketed most of that money. And as for our villains, the Dukes, they get their comeuppance at the end of trading day.

SMITH: Turns out they borrowed a lot of that money they just lost.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "TRADING PLACES")

ALFRED DRAKE: (As President of Exchange) Margin call, gentlemen.

AMECHE: (As Mortimer Duke) Why, you can't expect us to...

RALPH CLANTON: (As Official #1) You know the rules of the exchange, Mr. Duke. All accounts to be settled at the end of the day's trading - without exception.

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) You know perfectly well we don't have $394 million in cash.

BRYAN CLARK: (As Official #2) I'm sorry, boys. Put the Duke brothers' seats on the exchange up for sale at once. Seize all assets of Duke & Duke commodities brokers, as well as all personal holdings of Randolph and Mortimer Duke.

BELLAMY: (As Randolph Duke) My God.

SMITH: And this dramatic, crazy, clearly Hollywood ending - the bad guys lose everything, they get booted out of their rich positions in the market - this really happens sometimes, according to Tom. He says people would borrow money, bet it all on a market move, and when it went the opposite direction they had to pay up.

PERONIS: Most clearing houses had people who were referred to as leg breakers. You know, not - they weren't like real mobster, you know, leg breakers. But they were the ones who would say, all right, you know, time to pony up. All right, well, you know, we want your house. We want your IRA.

SMITH: It would happen right there on the floor?

PERONIS: That's a little overdramatized, but it would happen that day or the next day. You know, there wouldn't be much of a time lag.

MARS: He said there's one more unrealistic thing, at least in today's world. Computer trading took over the commodities market. That climactic scene - if they remade the movie today, it would sound a lot like this.

PERONIS: It's all people staring at screens today. You know, this kind of obvious drama is gone from the business.

SMITH: It would be a very quiet...

PERONIS: Yes.

SMITH: ...Climactic scene.

PERONIS: The Duke brothers would be in their own private hell, you know, looking at a computer screen, head buried in their hands.

MARS: Tom Peronis says - and this makes me very happy - that people still bring up the movie when he says he trades in orange juice futures. And even among his fellow traders there's a sort of reverence for the movie, that lines from the script have become part of the lingo of commodities trading.

PERONIS: Definitely some of these lines have become stock phrases, like, over the years, especially in the OJ market. I've heard people say, like, sell Mortimer, sell Mortimer. You know, Duke & Duke is buying. I've heard that too many times to count. Yeah, it's definitely become part of the OJ lore.

SMITH: (Laughter) Well there wasn't much OJ lore...

PERONIS: That's right.

SMITH: ...To add to, really.

PERONIS: Yeah, that's right. There's not much OJ lore in the first place, but the stuff from "Trading Places" makes up a significant chunk of it.

(SOUNDBITE OF WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART'S "THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO")

SMITH: You know, Roman, I always assumed that this whole scam was illegal. Our heroes basically stole inside information. They essentially stole the crop report. And they took all this money not just from the Dukes but from everyone in the market. And at the end, they're sitting on a Caribbean Beach. And I thought, oh, they're on the run from the law. But it turns out at the time, insider trading was not strictly illegal in the commodities market.

MARS: And that kind of makes sense because there's so many people involved. If you are a farmer trading corn, you have this ultimate inside information about corn, and everyone in the agriculture business knows a little something that someone else doesn't. But it's the part where they steal the crop report that seems way, way over the line.

SMITH: Yeah, setting aside the actual theft of the suitcase, which happens...

MARS: Right.

SMITH: ...In the movie, you shouldn't steal...

MARS: Which is illegal in every respect (laughter).

SMITH: You should not steal things. But the actual way in which they made money with stolen information, it turns out that was legal. And I learned this because when Congress was coming up with the banking reform law, Dodd-Frank in 2010, they were debating what should be in the bill and not. And they came up with this special provision. It's something that the chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Gary Gensler, he said, we need this thing. It is called the Eddie Murphy Rule, a rule that will make what happened in "Trading Places" illegal.

MARS: And it made it in. It's Dodd-Frank Section 746, which basically says that a federal employee can't leak information about the price of a commodity so that someone can make money off of it. And a person who gets that leaked information, they can't use that to make money off of the market.

SMITH: Yeah, Gensler said that before this rule went into effect what Eddie Murphy - Billy Ray Valentine - and Dan Aykroyd - Louis Winthorpe III - what they did - misappropriate information and then use it to corner the orange juice market - what they did was not actually illegal.

MARS: They got away with it.

SMITH: They got away with it.

MARS: Oh, that makes me so happy.

Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Robert Smith. It's the 4th of July weekend
The Planet Money staff is off on this day of independence, but we're gonna take you to a place that celebrates
Independence from government a place where you can cook your bacon in elaborate forms without government interference
Well, you can do as the founding fathers intended you can buy food
Uninspected by any government regulator paid for without money
Coined by some state authority but rather using bits of silver mined from the earth
And we will meet a nine-year-old who will sell you alcohol. It's the wilds of New Hampshire coming up a quick note before
We start today's show this episode originally aired in June of 2011
But we are bringing it back to you today for the crucial reason that it's a 4th of July weekend
We wanted to take the weekend off. Let's be honest and it's a fun show
And it's a fun show too and and Robert
I think today's podcast originated with an incredibly clever idea
the idea being that you wanted to take a mini vacation up in northern New Hampshire and have a reason to expense that to
Planet money and NPR. Unfortunately, my expense slips were in silver and gold but no no
I actually went for reportorial reasons because New Hampshire where I went in the White Mountains
It is the site of the porcupine freedom festival and the people there call themselves porcupines because they're cute
They're cuddly and you don't want to mess with them. And at first glance the freedom festival looks like just about any other festival
There's tents. There's young people there's lines for the bathroom
But you know how if you're into art or alternative culture you go to Burning Man every year
Absolutely, but if you love music you go to Bonnaroo sure all the time. I have no idea what that is
Well, if you think the Federal Reserve is illegal that we should return our money to the gold standard
If you believe we should abolish the IRS then you go to the porcupine festival to pork fest as they call it
All right, and and we should say we're talking obviously about libertarians
These are like big L libertarians and we've talked a lot about the libertarian philosophy here on planet money
I think it's important to remember there are lots of different ways of being a libertarian some are true
Anarcho-capitalists who think there should be absolutely no government, but most libertarians I've talked to believe there is a role for government
But a very small limited one largely to protect property rights to set the conditions so that
Citizens can make arrangements amongst themselves. There doesn't need to be so much regulation. There shouldn't be so much taxation
Libertarians generally think it's now the government's business whether or not I do drugs who I marry
What food I eat and we've covered these theories before on planet money, but we wondered how do you make it work in real?
I mean, how do you buy things in a libertarian society?
How do you how do you eat breakfast with no government role and it turns out it's actually more complicated than you might think
So I arrived at this festival in the middle of the night and the next morning around 830
I came out to the campground and I smelled freedom which actually smells a lot like bacon
Oh, yeah, we're just cooking this up. How you doing today?
How much bacon do you have I purchased 150 pounds of bacon and I actually weaved 90 of it and
By weaved I mean I made a 10 piece bacon weave. It's 10 pieces of bacon. I weave it into like a little blanket
And it's about the size of a CD case
That's a George Mandrake and he set up a tent right in the middle of the campground where he sells bacon weaves and
Bacon weave omelets with cheese
Yeah, I know you have to picture this place Adam
You would love it and not just for the bacon
Everyone has their little tents where they sleep or their RVs
But out front most people have set up some sort of stand or table where they sell food
They sell books. They sell precious metals gold silver copper
This is what they do in the forest rather than you know, just make s'mores around the campfire. They
participate in a market they buy and sell things and
You can't just buy or sell anything you have to sort of brag that you are doing it without the government
So George tells me proudly that he has no permit for his bacon that his grill has never been inspected
That he will not pay taxes to the government
They want their cut basically and they want to take they won't take part of my profit away from me
You know the fruits of my labor and hey, you know, they don't have any business and they don't I don't want them
In my business at all. So I just I just say hey, you know if somebody wants to buy my food
That's between me and them and they it's none of their business what I'm doing
We don't need to regulate George because we'll regulate him if he poisons me
I won't buy his food and he'll be done. So to run him out of the campground exactly
That was it camo who was waiting in line for a bacon weave and when he says he will take you out of
The campground he means it. He's got a gun in a holster on his belt. It's an XDM Springfield
Well, he told me that and you get the impression that no matter how tough a New Hampshire food inspector is
He's not as tough as it is
But when you think about it, it is it is really hard to get the government out of your breakfast or out of your life
in any way, I mean
George might be in this immediate instance avoiding permits and taxes, but you know, he got eggs
Presumably the USDA is inspecting those eggs. The USDA inspects the bacon
Yeah, and George is a little
Sheepish about this. He says that oftentimes he can get unregulated eggs
But you know, he's serving so many breakfasts
He had to buy them in a store and so the eggs and the bacon are actually approved by the government at some point
and you could tell that people give him a hard time give all these libertarians a hard time about driving on the
Federal highways or or buying things in a store and and George has a little speech that he says over and over again
He says look I am NOT a hermit. I do not live in the forest and avoid all forms of commerce
He's just trying to minimize the role of the federal government
So for instance to pay for the bacon weave omelet George will take dollars US dollars, but he prefers gold and silver
One of the most common is what they call junk silver
Which is pre 1964 dimes or quarters and also certain years of half dollars all kinds of things like that
We also take bullion. I've already had a somebody pay me in a gram of gold and
We just pretty much started a tab. We counted as $50 and we just owe him that money even food
So they would come by we had a little list we kept track of so in your cash register, is there gold?
Is there something?
One gram of silver five grams silver 10.1 grams of gold Wow, that's cool. Yeah
Whoa, it's like a strand of gold. How much is this worth? Um, Jay, what are these ten bucks?
$9
You know, I heard this all day long now. How much is the silver now? What's the rate on gold?
I mean remember it is 830 in the morning. There are campers lined up for breakfast
they have not had their coffee yet and people are trying to do math in their heads about the price of gold and silver, but
Gold and silver in the last few years. There's been periods of intense volatility
Are they like they got their iPhones out and they're checking the gold and silver price date moment by moment. Yes
They are I asked them this and they do it on their phones. They do it on internet connections
There are little boards that are posted all over the campground with the current prices of gold and silver and you know
The weird thing is is although they hate to a person the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve note
Which is what they call the US dollar the Federal Reserve note
They do have to keep translating gold and silver prices into dollars people are constantly talking about how much for this and how much
For that and they speak in dollars, but you know, I want the most government free omelet
I can get so and all you have are Federal Reserve notes at that moment. Unfortunately, that's what I get paid in
So I have to leave the breakfast line to go get some silver now
Luckily at this time in the morning
There is a mini bank and a mint an actual mint set up on a folding table down the hill. I'm Ron Hellwig
I am the I don't know if you would call it inventor designer, whatever of the Shire silver model
Well, you're sort of the Federal Reserve chairman. You're the Ben Bernanke of silver here in the campground. Well
without the violence
The violence. Oh, it just seems like such a calm man
Yeah, he seems like it but you know, he's he's like the mafia Don who can you know talk reasonable
But you know if you go up against him odds are you're gonna get hurt
you called a
Super free-market libertarian Ben Bernanke. Yeah, I know
Even I know that's a really dumb thing to do
That is I think that's literally the most insulting thing you could say you could have called him Stalin or even President Obama
And it wouldn't have been quite as offensive to him turns out
They do not think that the Federal Reserve is a subject for joking I screwed up
So I learned that you have to avoid the whole subject of the Fed and I don't even ask him to elaborate on the whole
Violence thing because I need silver. I need coffee. I need to buy my breakfast
So the thing about Ron is that he has invented a very neat little version of silver that I want to buy from him
And you know how everyone mocks the people who say that we should use gold and silver they say
Oh, what are you gonna do carry around a bunch of coins in your pocket with your pants sagging down with all that gold
Yeah, we got that little gold piece that was you know, like the size of a dime and that was four hundred and something dollars
So if we wanted like a penny or a nickel, what would we do just shave off a microscopic spec?
I don't know how you use precious metals and in day-to-day transactions
Well, actually that is what Ron does. He basically shaves off small strips of metal
He buys them from a jewelry supplier and then he laminates them
he takes the little tiny strips of metal and he has an office laminator and he makes something about the size of a
Credit card and I have one right here. It is a little card. It says Shire silver. It's laminated and on the back
What do you see there? Oh, wow. Yeah, there's like a little tiny tiny tiny metal bar. Very very thin
Shire silver defending traditional value. I paid a buck 90 for that
Wow buck 90 for this. All right, I actually you know, this would work, right?
It's it's almost more convenient than a dollar bill. Well, that's the great thing about it
Is that it makes it so you can carry silver in your wallet. So I bought a bunch of these
All right, but I let me just say I'm assuming you know about as much about silver as I do which means I have no
Idea how much this thin little bar is worth. It's shiny. It is shiny
I don't know if it's and it also it's packed inside of this card
Which seems much heavier than the little bar of silver
So I can't really weigh it to figure out how much it is
So you're just in the woods in New Hampshire and you hand the guy a whole lot of money and he hands you a bunch
Of cards and claims that they're worth what they're worth
Yep, and he says oh you can go to a jeweler
But once again we are in the woods in New Hampshire and so he says, you know
Basically, look you have to trust me on this and this is the weird thing about being up at this campground
I mean, there's some tough guys here. They're carrying guns
They don't trust the government, but they keep saying you've got to trust me
We've got to trust each other, you know
And I realized that one of the services that government offers us is the luxury of not trusting one another
I mean, that's why you have inspectors
That's why you have police because you assume that somebody's out to get you somebody's out to poison your food or steal your stuff
But when you're in the campground, you kind of have to take people at their word
So I take my 10 grams of silver and I head back to the omelet stand because once again, I am desperate for coffee and
Even there I'm trusting George who is making my bacon weave omelet that he washed his hands somewhere at some point in the campground
And I think this is exactly the point libertarians would say is all those government inspectors all of those symbols of trust in our society
They're false. They're fake that that you can't trust the restaurant
And so why not call it what it is and force yourself to only trust people who deserve your trust rather than just believing in a
Government that's probably letting you down or in my case not thinking about it because I'm so hungry
So I have a cup of coffee and a bacon weave omelet. What's it gonna cost me five of those?
So they're two bucks a piece
Roughly equal to about two bucks a piece. Okay. Okay. I have a five gram
Have a five gram silver card here. That's valued at ten dollars right now
Excellent. Good deal. Thanks
I don't know if you noticed by actually got a great deal on that omelet
They valued silver at a higher price than I bought it at ten minutes later
I made a profit kind of well, it sounds like anytime you can have a bacon weave omelet
you've made a profit, but it seems to me that if you don't have just a
Regular currency that everyone agrees on it's it's an awful lot of work
Well, I mean that's kind of the point of the porcupine festival like everything's a lot of work
You know you have to like track down who is selling what and you have to figure out what they're taking some of them
Take silver in grams some of them in ounces and so people are constantly trying to translate those in their head
Some people take gold some guys sold me copper who he said that it's the next big thing
Yeah, it's not the next big thing
But they're doing all of this to make a point
They say they want to be ready if the Federal Reserve dollar or they should say when the Federal Reserve dollar goes under
When it's not when paper money isn't worth anything anymore
They're gonna know what the next currency is it's gonna be something like this little silver strip
Is that I thought it's illegal to print your own currency
Are they allowed to actually do this? Well?
There are many laws about this. It's illegal to mint coins that resemble US currency
I mean, that's just counterfeiting, but it's also illegal
So I understand it to set up systems that compete with official currency now. What does that mean?
You know there was one alternative currency called the Liberty dollar that
Some people felt was a little too competitive with the dollar that they were using as a currency and that got a bunch of people
arrested so are there like
Secret service around ready to pounce on on your silver card
Manufacturer well, I mean, you know if you press people they will make it clear
They say listen you're not buying something with silver you are trading something of value
Silver for something else of value bacon-weave omelet for instance, and if you have a silver coin
They don't call it silver coin
It's called a silver round because a coin would be illegal only the government can make a coin
But a silver round is just an object of value that you can trade
But listen this is this is all just semantics because to tell you the truth the people here like
Breaking the law a lot of them like breaking the law they are proud of smashing what they consider stupid laws
So you can buy bootleg cigarettes four dollars a pack without all the government taxes and they will proudly say I did not pay
taxes on these cigarettes
There's illegal bars without liquor licenses and they sell moonshine. There's marijuana trade
But listen when it comes to illegal moments, my favorite my favorite is this little hardened criminal
I'm Dorothy and I'm nine years old
Dorothy she was in the family tent and they had just had a lesson for kids
About economics and market realities
But you basically it was like a little camp for little tiny libertarians and the camp council was encouraging kids to sell
Whatever they can think of to the unsuspecting adults walking by and so Dorothy had this little stack of woven
They look like little potholders. She called them coasters where they woven out of bacon. No, they were woven out of out of fabric
But then they were sitting there in front of them. They were beautiful and I have kids
So I bought one with silver. She was very pleased to get silver
So I would like the yellow coaster potholder I like it simpler and
Here you go. Here's one gram of silver
Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Oh
Yeah, and with every potholder you get a free bottle of beer I get a free bottle of beer
Yep, you are both a bartender and a craftsman pretty much
What kind of beer do you have
See for yourself
For I actually don't know
You bought beer from a nine-year-old girl. It was delicious. You are a criminal like you
Contributed to the corruption of a minor. Yeah, that's probably right and and listen
I know it looks bad if you went to you know
Let's say a state legislature and you said, you know, I'd like to legalize children selling alcohol on little stands in front of
Their home. I mean, I mean politicians would freak out it would never happen. But I got to tell you something
This transaction seemed so innocent it was like buying a cup of lemonade from a lemonade stand
Dorothy wasn't sneaking any of the beer and her mom was right next to her the whole time
It was fine with us. And if if an adult comes by and wants to have the beer, that's their choice
If a parent comes by and sees the beer and they don't want to participate in that that's their choice as well
But you have standards like if a six-year-old comes and wants the beer, I would not give beer to a six-year-old
No, I would not
See they have standards and and it brings it back to that whole trust thing
Every bootleg alcohol stand that I went to told me that they would not serve minors
But the key is it's not because the government told them to but out of respect for the parents
They didn't want parents coming to them and say why did you serve my 16 year old?
Here and I gotta say this is an area where I have a lot of sympathy for them because
We do have a lot of insane regulations in America. It is true
There are a lot of nutty regulations and and liquor beer wine
This is an area where many of our regulations are nonsensical. I mean there's states where you can only buy
booze from
State offices the state shouldn't be selling alcohol in the US you can buy wine and wine stores
But you can't buy them in
Supermarkets and no company can own several wine stores at once which creates inefficiencies in the marketplace and
You know, I think a lot of economists see this not as helping protect our young children or anything. It's just
Protecting the interest of large wine distributors or large spirits companies and and so I have sympathy for them
Although of course, I don't go out to the woods of New Hampshire
I just buy wine at the wine store and just deal with it
But it does sound like you would fit in there and I gotta say
You know, this is why so many people that I talked to out of the campground
They talked so proudly about breaking the law
They walked me through each and every gory detail of how they broke the law. They gave me their full names
They're basically daring law enforcement to drag them away
And and there's a reason for this which is they believe that if they disobey laws, which they feel are
Stupid they're gonna be just like a guy named Mike Fisher the rogue
manicurist I
Know this guy's a legend here among these porcupines in New Hampshire in 2005
Mike Fisher had heard about all the regulations it takes to become a manicurist in New Hampshire just to do nails
And so he took action in the campground. I met a guy named Dave Minson who was a friend of Mike Fisher's and he told
the story
There was a group of us and kind of as a civil protest
He called the the board of manicurists or whatever their
Governing board is he told him he was going to perform and he'd let go acts out in the kind of the yard in front of
Their building so was outside the headquarters of the manicurist Association or whatever exactly. So what he did is he
Trimmed another gal that was with us nails. So what do you have just a little nail clipper in a file?
Oh, yeah, she was sitting on a chair and then he was kneeling in front of her
You know and he just trimmed up her nails and then they called in the authorities
They arrested him. They actually took him away in a police car. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
So Mike Fisher pleaded guilty he took the case to court
He wanted to have his moment to talk about manicurist laws and he did this became a huge press story around the nation
People covered this crazy rogue manicurists and and in the end in fact in the last session of the state legislature
In New Hampshire, there were a number of bills introduced to not only deregulate
manicurists
But here's the list of things that they want to abolish licensing for
barbers tanning facilities landscape architects court reporters family mediators guides athletic trainers massage therapists peddlers and
Itinerant vendors much like George Wow
And I will say there is a big literature among economists in the US about how often licensing laws
Just like liquor laws don't serve the general interest
They just serve a certain group of people allowing them to charge much more for their services because it limits the number of people supplying them
And it ends up hurting the general public which is supposedly the people who are supposed to be protected by these licensing laws
So is that their dream that they'll sort of one-by-one
have these little civil disobedient moments and and
Destroy the regulatory and monetary apparatus of the US government and eventually will all be
Effectively living in the woods of New Hampshire
Well, I'm sure that's the dream for some of them
Remember some think that these these little laws are silly and they want to get rid of those
But a lot of the people I talked to want to get rid of all taxes
They want to get rid of the the school system. They believe people should homeschool should be private schools
They want to get rid of most government services
Absolutely health care Social Security all these things should be gone in their point of view
I know many libertarians want to get rid of the army, right?
They think we should not intervene in foreign wars
We should only have a small defensive force to protect our borders
So, you know, it's it's cute to say that you know, the manicure laws are silly
but these people have a serious goal a lot of them have a serious goal to fundamentally change the United States of America and
If the campground the porcupine festival is any judge
It is going to be a difficult road because even the simplest things there are not quite working the way they should now
Remember that silver I bought to buy my bacon weave extra silver and so come dinnertime
I heard about this Thai food restaurant. I guess it was a tent Thai food tent across the campground
so I traveled the other side of the campground and
I order a Thai burrito and I whip out my little silver cards the Shire silver cards and the guy looks at him
And he just shakes his head. He says his coin guy back home won't take him
He's like well
Do you have any of the silver rounds or or those old dimes the ones that you know before?
1965 whatever where than when they were made of silver and as I'm standing there the guy behind me in line says well
You know, I'll give you a dollar ten for each of those little strips of silver
But you paid a dollar ninety that paid a dollar ninety all of a sudden. I feel like a total sucker now
I'm the one asking. Where's the trust guys? Where's the trust?
But you learned a valuable lesson you learned that the market always has the last word
Please let us know what you thought
I'm actually trying to think are we gonna get angry letters or happy letters from libertarians?
We'll find out planet money at NPR org
