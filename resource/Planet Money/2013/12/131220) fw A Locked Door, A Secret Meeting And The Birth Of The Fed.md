**faster whisper:**
Here at Planet Money, we like to observe the big holidays.
There's April 15th, tax day.
There's January 11th, which I don't need to tell you is Alexander Hamilton's birthday.
And of course, coming up, December 23rd, the day the Federal Reserve was created.
This is a particularly big one this year because the Fed is turning 100 years old.
And it's one of the most powerful institutions in the world.
Hey, you know what I'm going to say, it is the most powerful institution in the
world.
Today, we tell the story of its creation.
There is a 70-year-old man with a bad cold and a bunch of mistresses.
There's a nation that's deeply ambivalent about the idea of an immensely powerful central
bank.
And there is a group of bankers who meet in secret in a private rail car and to conceal
their identities, they swear to use first names only.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Robert.
And I'm Jacob.
Today on the show, the story of the Fed.
The story of the Federal Reserve system of the United States starts at 512 a.m. on April
18th, 1906.
You may know the state.
It's when a massive earthquake hit San Francisco.
The earthquake and the fires destroyed the city.
And the consequences of this are felt truly around the world.
Insurance companies in London are paying millions of dollars in claims to people
in San Francisco.
The U.S. economy, the whole U.S. winds up falling into a recession.
Unemployment shoots up.
On Wall Street, the stock market falls by 50 percent.
And by 1907, banks start shutting down.
And not just the bad banks, because this thing starts happening that often happens
during a financial crisis.
People panic.
There are rumors on the street.
People start pulling money out of banks that are totally stable.
And it gets so bad that people start camping out overnight, waiting in line just
to pull their money out of the bank when it opens.
In fact, some banks make their tellers count out people's money very slowly.
One, two, three, just to keep the money in the vaults.
A panic like this can be deadly for an economy.
Healthy banks shut down.
Businesses can't borrow money.
They lay people off.
There's even more fear about the financial system.
And the cycle just keeps going.
And at this point in 1907, the U.S.
government has no institution to deal with this panic.
They have no way to stem it.
So the job of saving the U.S.
economy falls to one man, J.P.
Morgan of J.P.
Morgan fame.
He was basically at one point running the world economy from his private
library in a mansion here on Madison Avenue in New York.
We're just looking.
This place is dripping money.
It's a museum now, but you can see what it looked like in J.P.
Morgan's time.
There are tapestries and giant vaults filled with ancient manuscripts.
And we're here with Liyachit Ahmed, a financial historian.
And he points out that looking down on us from high above is the man
On the front wall is a portrait of J.P.
Morgan looking very stern.
He has very fiery eyes and he's he's not a you know he's not a pussycat.
I mean he's he's a very he's a very intimidating guy.
He's a guy who can summon the most powerful financiers in America to come
to his library basically any time he wants.
And during the panic of 07, money was walking in and out the door of
this place every day.
It was where the presidents of the biggest banks in America came to try and
figure out how to deal with the crisis.
So these are guys with top hats and yeah yeah yeah they're old fashioned
bankers with you know whiskers and top hats and frock coats.
Monocles I imagine.
Well I don't know about monocles.
Cigars. Cigars.
Cigars were obligatory.
J.P. Morgan during this whole time had a terrible cold and was eating
nothing but he would smoke a lot of cigars.
And as the smoke builds the panic gets worse and worse until J.P.
Morgan finally says guys we have got to draw the line.
We're going to stop this panic and he comes up with a plan for the
presidents of the big trust companies to contribute twenty five million
dollars a lot of the time to a pool of money that's going to be used to
save the healthy trust the banks that should not fail.
And on one Saturday night he calls some of the most powerful men in America
into the library.
And so J.P. Morgan draws up a list says twenty five million.
This is how much each one of you owes presents the trust company
presidents with with a piece of paper and says OK sign here.
And they don't sign.
So he locks the doors.
And this was this was the door that was locked.
There's an actual chain in here.
We're not leaving until I've got all the signatures.
I can't get in the door.
It's still locked.
He never unlocked it.
There's still bankers inside.
That night J.P. Morgan went into his secretary's office and played
solitaire while the bankers hashed things out.
And by five in the morning they had all signed the list.
And that essentially was the end of the panic of 1907.
Panic's over.
Time to make money at least until the next panic.
That's probably what people on Wall Street were thinking.
People in Washington at least some of them were thinking
something pretty different.
They were thinking wait why does the fate of the U.S.
economy hinge on one rich guy in New York.
Relying on J.P. Morgan to bail out the U.S.
financial system.
And by the way this has been the second time he'd done it.
Didn't make sense.
And particularly since J.P. Morgan was 70 and was working
two hours a day and liked to go off traveling with his
bevy of middle aged mistresses.
He didn't have a lot of panics left in him.
Yeah exactly.
And you know if he was somewhere in Italy when a panic
broke out that would be a problem.
One very powerful guy in particular decides this is a
problem.
Senator Nelson Aldrich.
He's a Civil War veteran.
He's been in the Senate for about 30 years.
The head of the banking committee Theodore Roosevelt
called him the kingpin of the Republican Party.
And Aldrich looks at the U.S.
economy and he sees that it's not just the most recent
one but these panics just keep happening.
There was one in 1873.
There was another in 1884.
There was 1890 the panic of 1893 1896.
They keep coming.
And then there's the big one in 1907.
And Aldrich knows that there's something that
America can do so that it will no longer have to
rely on just one guy when these panics happen.
The U.S. can create he thinks a central bank.
In 1907 creating a central bank is not some crazy new
idea.
They've been around in Europe for a long time already.
The U.S. itself had a central bank in the early
part of the 19th century and central banks had this
key function back then.
They served as what's called a lender of last
resort.
And what that means is when there's a panic when
people are pulling money out of banks that are
basically healthy sound banks a central bank can
step in and lend money oftentimes unlimited amount
of money to the healthy banks just so they can
get through the panic and things can go back
to normal.
But just consider the name central bank.
Throughout American history both of those words
both central and bank have been deeply unpopular.
That's why the U.S. got rid of its central bank
back in the 1830s.
Yeah but Nelson Aldrich believes that if he
draws up the right kind of plan he can win
over Congress and the American people.
So Nelson Aldrich travels to Europe and they
say hey you know the central bank thing you
should try it.
It works great.
They say yeah we don't have these American
problems because we saw them 50 years ago or
100 years ago.
Jerry Richardson is an economist at UC Irvine
and at the Richmond Fed.
And he told us this whole story of what
Aldrich did next.
So Aldrich looks around and says OK maybe we
want a central bank.
But in order to design a central bank one
that works in the United States of America
he needs expertise.
He basically needs bankers to help him create
a central bank and he knows that that's not
going to look good to have bankers sort of
design their own central bank.
So in 1910 he comes up with a plan.
Robert we're standing here at the Hoboken
train station in Hoboken New Jersey and
we're here because this place or some place
right near here was was key to Aldrich's
plan.
He told some of the most powerful bankers
in the country I want you to gather at the
train station but I want you to come in
secret.
And he meant really secret.
He told these bankers do not travel
together.
Come alone.
Only use your first names.
Do not address each other by your last
names.
And most importantly don't come here in your
top hat and your monocle looking like a
million bucks.
They came here dressed as duck hunters as
if they were going on oh you know I don't
know you know a Thanksgiving duck hunting
expedition.
One of these bankers who Aldrich invited his
name was Frank Vanderlip.
He was an executive at National City Bank
and and he wrote about this decades later.
He said they were told that when they got
here they would find Aldrich's private rail
car attached to the back of a southbound
train.
And he says when I came to that car the
blinds were down and only slender threads
of amber light showed the shape of the
windows.
Once aboard the private car we began to
observe the taboo that had been fixed
on last names.
We addressed one another as Ben Paul
Nelson Abe.
And Vanderlip writes that as soon as
they got on this private rail car they
started to work on a plan for a new
central bank for the United States.
But the car itself was bound for Georgia
because they were going to meet in a
private club on an island off the coast
of Georgia private club by the way that
JP Morgan used to be a member of.
The name of that private club the name
of the island Jekyll Island Jekyll
Island.
Again this is Gary Richardson.
Now at the time did that sound as
suspicious as it sounds today.
No actually I haven't checked this but I
think that they had not the book Dr.
Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde who had not was not as popular
then was not as widely known as is
today.
So it didn't sound as crazily
suspicious as it sounds today because
it sure does now.
Yeah and I think if if the word
Jekyll had as much of a kind of
mysterious negative dangerous
connotation then as it does today
they would have chosen a different
resort.
You know Key West or somewhere like
that.
Robert for the record you and I did
not get to go to Jekyll Island or
to Key West anywhere warm or nice.
It was cold and Hoboken.
But Richardson did go to Jekyll
Island.
And if you are going to go off and
have a secret meeting with a cabal
of bankers it sounds like Jekyll
Island is a really nice place to do
it.
Was there something the club that
made you think now this is swag.
This is what JP Morgan would have
liked.
Everything at the club makes you
think that it's old hardwood
construction.
It's just a beautiful kind of
European antique interiors.
So Aldrich and the bankers hole up
in this beautiful empty resort for
about a week.
It's actually Thanksgiving while
they're there and Vanderlip writes
that they have turkey with
oyster stuffing.
And as they're enjoying their
meal they talk about sort of the
big challenge that they face in
bringing this to the American
public.
Americans think that a central
bank would become too powerful
too influential in the economy.
All of the guys at Jekyll Island
knew the history of money and
banking in the United States
and they understood that the
financial interests of Virginia
tobacco farmers is different than
the financial interests of an
importer exporter in New York.
So they come up with a classic
American workaround.
The country is not going to have
one central bank in Washington
D.C.
It's going to have lots of
central banks little central
banks scattered all around the
country.
So they say like New York
probably should have its its
own central bank.
But they that you know cotton
growing south could get a
central bank.
The West Coast with its
extractive industries and rapid
growth can get a central bank.
The Jekyll Island boys leave
Georgia return to Washington
D.C. and New York with
a plan now officially known as
the Aldrich Plan.
And they think it's pretty
great. They think we have
finally designed a central
bank specifically for the United
States of America.
Well it gets shot down in
Congress gets tweaked gets
debated takes years.
But the basic idea they came up
with there in that swanky
resort.
It holds up.
And so 100 years ago this
month December 1913
President Woodrow Wilson signs
the Federal Reserve Act and
the USA finally has a central
bank.
Actually it has 12 central
banks spread all around the
country.
Take that Europe.
So here we are 100 years
later and to this day there
is still a debate over what
Aldrich and the bankers did
at Jekyll Island.
Clearly creating the Fed did
not solve the problem with
financial panics.
There was the Great
Depression to name a big one.
And everybody even Ben
Bernanke himself agrees that
the Fed really screwed up
actually made the Great
Depression worse.
Yeah the Fed continued to
evolve after the Depression
the Fed's power got more
concentrated in Washington.
It became basically one
central bank and it wasn't
just the lender of last
resort anymore.
It became the creator of
money from thin air.
And by 2008 the Federal
Reserve had more power than
JP Morgan ever dreamed of.
When the financial crisis hit
the Fed used that power to
step in stop the panic and
probably prevent another
Great Depression.
But at the same time a lot
of people have said the
Fed's own policies
contributed to the 2008
crisis in the first place.
Clearly that fundamental
American uneasiness about
a powerful central bank
that everyone's been
struggling with all along.
That uneasiness is still
with us.
But there is this fact today
every major economy in the
world made the same choice
that we did.
Every economy has a central
bank.
Whenever we bring up the
Federal Reserve or Ben
Bernanke we always get a
lot of notes.
So take this down carefully.

And I'll also mention here
Liaquat Ahmed the
financial historian we talk
to.
He wrote a fantastic book
about central banking and
the Great Depression.
It's called Lords of
Finance.
If you're at all interested
read it.
It's a Planet Money
