On today's Planet Money: Why a dead shark costs $12 million, and a photo of steel wool that looks like a tornado costs $1,265.

In other words, we wade into the economics of the art world.

Here's a slide show with some of the works we talk about in the podcast:

    This Ansel Adams photo sold for $722,500 at an auction this week — a record for a work by Adams. When an artist is just starting out, and isn't famous enough to command huge sums at auction, who decides how much a work of art is worth?

    Matthew Albanese, builds models out of everyday materials. That tornado is made out of steel wool; the grass is parsley.Ed Winkleman owns a New York gallery that has shown Albanese's work. He says there are three basic criteria for pricing emerging artists' work: size, complexity and materials. A big, intricate oil painting costs more than a small, simple drawing.This Albanese photo can be your...

    If you're a famous artist — like, say, Damien Hirst — the basic pricing used for emerging artists goes out the window. Some really rich people want to own Hirst's "The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living" — also known as a shark in formaldehyde. So they bid against other really rich people, and the price goes up to a reported $12 million. (Photo: Regina Kuehne/KEYSTO...

    William Baumol, an NYU economist, analyzed sales records from auction houses over 200 years. He found that art rarely beats out stocks and bonds as an investment; he published the results in a paper subtitled "Art Investment as Floating Crap Game."Baumol is an amateur artist, by the way. This is one of his works. He says he occasionally sells his works to colleagues for a few hundred bucks.(Ima...

    Just because some rich guy pays $12 million for a shark today, it doesn't mean some other rich guy will pay $13 million tomorrow.An artist named David Roberts painted this in 1861. Back then, his works were "the delight of kings," according to one critic. Roberts died in 1864, and his work largely fell out of favor. Seventy years later, a painting of his sold for 10 guineas — almost nothing.(Im...

SALLY HELM, HOST:

Hey, everyone. Sally Helm here. The market for art is really fickle. Something that sold for a ton of money last year might be hard to even sell it all next year. And this story, from way back in 2010, explains those dynamics really well.

So we are re-airing that show today. We'll have an update for you at the end where we run some numbers and tell you whether or not you should be putting all your money into sharks pickled in formaldehyde. It'll make sense later. Here's the show.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: This show starts with a number, and That number is 12 million.

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: Twelve million dollars - that is how much a 15-foot shark in formaldehyde, by artist Damien Hirst, reportedly sold for in 2005. The title, which I love, is "The Physical Impossibility Of Death In The Mind Of Someone Living."

KESTENBAUM: That title alone is worth $12 million.

BLUMBERG: (Laughing) Exactly.

KESTENBAUM: I have another, slightly smaller number $1.5 million. That is how much Eddie Saunders tried to sell his shark for. Eddie Saunders owned an electrical shop, and he said he had a shark hanging in his shop before Hirst did his shark thing. And so Saunders ran an ad saying, New Year's sale, only 1 million British pounds. Save 5 million pounds on the Damien Hirst copy. Nobody bought his shark. That anecdote, by the way, comes from a book I've been reading called "The $12 Million Stuffed Shark" about the art business.

BLUMBERG: And that anecdote is - sort of encapsulates what our podcast is about today. Why does one guy's stuffed shark sell for $12 million and another guy basically can't even sell his stuffed shark?

KESTENBAUM: Hello and welcome to the PLANET MONEY art gallery. Walk around, pour yourself some wine in one of those little plastic cups, take a look at the art.

BLUMBERG: I have to say these pieces are really speaking to me, David. I enjoyed that one - the bold color, the vibrant dynamism of the brush strokes. But you know the thing I like about it most?

KESTENBAUM: What?

BLUMBERG: It's so cheap. It's a bargain. Today we're going to try to figure out the answer to that question that no artist likes to discuss - price. That wonderful thing that you just created out of thin air, that you just poured your creative soul into - how much does that thing cost?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: Alex, let's start with a sound. I'm going to play you a sound. Tell me if you can guess what it is.

(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS ECHOING)

BLUMBERG: Identify it? I can barely hear it.

KESTENBAUM: Come on, listen.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: It's an empty room. It sounds like an empty room.

KESTENBAUM: That's the sound of the Winkleman Art Gallery on 27th Street in Chelsea.

BLUMBERG: How did I not know that?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, it's - it looks like an art gallery - you know, big empty room, white walls, photographs hung about eight feet apart or something like that. And I wanted to start the discussion here because, just this week - this is unconnected with the gallery - but an Ansel Adams photograph of Yosemite National Park sold for $772,000.

And when I visited the Winkleman Gallery, on the wall were photographs by this guy Matthew Albanese that look just as dramatic. One was of this huge, ominous tornado churning across a field. Another one was of a glacier in Antarctica. Another one was of a volcano. Except that Ed Winkleman, the guy who runs the gallery, said that's not a tornado, that's not Antarctica, and that's not a volcano.

ED WINKLEMAN: He builds these models out of everyday materials in his studio. So, for example, what looks like a tornado is actually steel wool. What looks like an iceberg is all made out of sugar. What looks like the volcano is tiling grout.

KESTENBAUM: That's pretty great. Let me look closer at the tornado.

WINKLEMAN: Foreground - what looks like grass and bushes is all made out of parsley. And they're very convincing.

KESTENBAUM: Alex, here, like, this is a...

BLUMBERG: Oh, really? Yeah, I totally want to see these.

KESTENBAUM: That's the iceberg made of sugar.

BLUMBERG: Oh, my God. It looks exactly like an iceberg. That's amazing. Wow.

KESTENBAUM: Apparently, it's all in, like, the lighting. He sets these things up and - there are all these photos where you can see him working on them in his studio. They're like little dioramas. But it's all about the lighting, I think.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. And we'll link to the photos of these on our blog - npr.org/money. But, Dave, I have a...

KESTENBAUM: You have an ugly question?

BLUMBERG: I have an ugly question.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: How much is that going to run me?

KESTENBAUM: It's $2,480, frame included.

BLUMBERG: It's cheaper than Ansel Adams. And look, he probably put a lot more work into it.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, that's true. But Ansel Adams is taking pictures of real stuff.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, but - so this guy had to make the iceberg and then take a photograph of it. That's so much harder.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, but it's not a real iceberg. All right. So it's a hard question. What should this photograph cost? I asked Ed Winkleman.

Can we talk about price?

WINKLEMAN: Yes. It's (unintelligible), I think.

KESTENBAUM: My question is harder than that. It's, how do you decide what price tag to put on something?

WINKLEMAN: OK. So there really is a system.

KESTENBAUM: Don't you love that? There's a system.

BLUMBERG: I love it. I can't imagine that the artists in Ed Winkleman's gallery like the fact that there's a system for pricing their art.

KESTENBAUM: No, he said - so he works with emerging artists, not Ansel Adams. No - people, you know, who aren't famous yet. And he says that there's always this awkward moment, you know. He'll have some new artist, really, really likes their work, and you're maybe sitting there in front of their paintings, and then you got to put a price tag on it. And the formula - it has very little to do with how good the art is.

WINKLEMAN: OK. So it depends on the scale.

KESTENBAUM: The size, you mean?

WINKLEMAN: Yes.

KESTENBAUM: Bigger costs more?

WINKLEMAN: Yes.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) What if it's small and super-detailed and beautiful?

WINKLEMAN: The scale is one aspect. So there's like three criteria - skill, what I would consider intensity - as you said, if it's very small and super-detailed, it took a lot more time.

KESTENBAUM: So scale, intensity. The third criteria is what he calls medium. In other words, what's it made of? Is the sculpture carved out of wood? Is it made of marble? And how many copies are there?

WINKLEMAN: If it's a photograph and you have multiple editions of it, it's going to be less expensive. Oil paintings in general are known to be about twice as expensive per square inch over the same artist's drawings.

BLUMBERG: Really?

WINKLEMAN: Yes.

BLUMBERG: All right. So what I'm learning is if I'm an emerging artist, I want to do big oil paintings and not tiny charcoal drawings.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah - really, really, really, really big.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: He says, at the end of the day, the artist decides, but this is - you know, you can go around to galleries and they're all sort of priced similarly.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. He also told you that there's actually a minimum price as well, right?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. There's sort of a minimum because, you know, as a gallery owner, he's got his own costs, right? He's got his rent. He's got his employees. He's got the wine that they serve at the opening. And he's got to make all that back. So...

BLUMBERG: So what is the cheapest possible painting you can buy in New York?

KESTENBAUM: I don't know. In a nice neighborhood, you know, they're going to run over a thousand bucks, right? You know, it's not like, you know, in a clothing store, you've got tons of clothing - jeans stacked up to the ceiling. Here, it's just like one piece of art and then like 10 feet, another piece of art, you know. So they're not going to be cheap.

BLUMBERG: All right. Well, that explains the prices of sort of artists that are, I guess, not well-known or are emerging, but it doesn't answer the question...

KESTENBAUM: The shark question.

BLUMBERG: The shark question - why does a shark in formaldehyde cost $12 million?

KESTENBAUM: Because it's awesome.

(LAUGHTER)

HELM: After the break, we answer the shark question.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: All right. So yeah - so what we've talked about now is prices for emerging artists, where the art really is like a commodity. But after that, you know, if people start buying your art, then it's like there are a different set of economic rules that kick in. And to talk about this, I went downtown to meet with William Baumol. He's an economist at NYU. He's 88 years old but still writing.

WILLIAM BAUMOL: I'm in competition with Methuselah these days. Most people my age have laid down their pens. However, I do remember having once attended a lecture by the noted economist A.C. Pigou. And he got up, and he said, you have to realize that I am best described as an ancient squid who still can sit and continues to eject squirts of ink. And I feel I qualify under that description.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Well, William Baumol, you certainly won my heart.

KESTENBAUM: So one of the things Baumol has studied over the years is the economics of art. He's actually an artist himself. He used to teach sculpture. There are paintings that he's done around his office. And he occasionally actually sells one to a colleague for a few hundred bucks. But Baumol is famous on this topic for a paper he wrote called "Unnatural Value: Or Art Investment As Floating Crap Game."

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Right. We got a lot of good titles in this podcast. So we have a copy of that paper here. It's from 1985. And it's a scan of the original paper. So it's a scan of a printout from 1985. It's on dot matrix printer paper - bringing back memories.

KESTENBAUM: I love it. Like, the O's are kind of squared off. And the underlining is just an underline under each letter. It's not like a long smooth line.

BLUMBERG: Younger listeners have no idea what we're talking about.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: All right. So we'll get to the art investment part in a second. But what Baumol says in that paper is that, in some ways, it's no mystery what determines the price of art. Art's like everything else, it's supply and demand.

If you're famous and you've got a line of people waiting to buy your next painting, you can charge more for that one. Or if you've got some rich guy who really wants to buy a formaldehyde shark, bidding against some other rich guy who also wants the shark, you know, the price goes up to $12 million.

He says what makes art different from a commodity like, you know, oil or ball bearings or rice and even different from things like stocks or bonds, is that with those things, you can try to calculate the price, but with art, good luck.

BAUMOL: They depend on swings in human tastes. And I am absolutely convinced that there is nothing about human taste that can be called, quote, "rational."

BLUMBERG: Well, I mean, except everybody knows blue is better than red.

KESTENBAUM: Alex, you used to like red better than blue.

BLUMBERG: I changed my mind.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. See? That's his point. Art depends purely on human taste. Here's something he wrote in the paper. Their prices float more or less aimlessly.

BLUMBERG: Well, but it's not aimless. I mean, there is - I mean, just like there's fundamentals for stocks and bonds, you could argue there are fundamentals for art. The fundamentals are just basically what the art critics think about the art.

KESTENBAUM: Instead of stock analysts.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, exactly. You have art critics, art analysts - in PLANET MONEY jargon. So speaking of the art analysts, as I'm going to continue to call them now, here's what one curator/art analyst had to say about Damien Hirst's formaldehyde shark. Quote, "it's brutally honest and confrontational. He draws attention to the paranoiac denial of death that permeates our culture."

KESTENBAUM: And therefore definitely worth $12 million.

BLUMBERG: Especially if you can sell it for more later. And that is the thing you hear about a lot - you hear about record prices for art in the news. You know, there's a Picasso that sold for over a hundred million. An Andy Warhol piece sold for $72 million recently at a Christie's auction. And so you hear a lot of people talking about art as an investment.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. Baumol says, you know, people say that all the time. You should buy art the way they say you should buy real estate or whatever. You know, it holds its value. It's a good investment. And, in fact, it's better than stocks and bonds. But he says that's wrong. And I can tell you, as an economist, just from theory, that should not be true. So here's his economic argument.

Alex, I'm going to give you a choice. You can buy a painting, or you can buy a bond. And in 10 years, they're both going to grow in value, and you'll be able to sell them for the exact same amount. Which would you pay more for?

BLUMBERG: Well, I guess - is the bond pretty?

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) No. It's a little piece of paper.

BLUMBERG: Is the painting pretty?

KESTENBAUM: The painting is really nice.

BLUMBERG: And I could hang it on my wall?

KESTENBAUM: You can hang it on your wall.

BLUMBERG: I guess I would pay more for the painting because I could hang it on my wall in the 10 years that I'm going to be keeping it before I sell it back.

KESTENBAUM: Right. So at the end of 10 years, they're both going to be worth the same. And you've just told me you're willing to pay more for the painting - right? - because it's pretty? That makes the painting a sort of crappy financial investment, right? You're paying more than you would for the bond, but you're getting the same amount back at the end.

BLUMBERG: Or it makes the bond a crappy aesthetic investment.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) All right, but financially speaking...

BLUMBERG: If you don't care about art.

KESTENBAUM: If you don't care about that art, you're just thinking about, like, I got my retirement money. Where am I going to put it? You're better off always, he says, putting it in stocks and bonds than in art. At least in theory, that should be true. So he wanted to test that idea. Turns out it's sort of hard to test because you need a good data set of art sales. And that's when he found the book.

BAUMOL: The book by Reitlinger.

KESTENBAUM: So we have it here. It's called "The Economics Of Taste: The Rise And Fall Of The Picture Market, 1760-1960" by Gerald Reitlinger.

BAUMOL: And it has pages and pages of data for works of art going back several centuries, data that were kept by the leading auction houses.

KESTENBAUM: So I'm looking at the book here. Rembrandt - here's Rembrandt. All right. So Rembrandt - the painting is "Old Man In A Black Hat" (ph), bought by Lord Scarsdale in 1761 for 210 pounds - 1760.

So, Alex, he had a colleague type in all those numbers and statistically analyze them.

BAUMOL: Well, we found exactly what had been predicted by the theory.

KESTENBAUM: By you.

BAUMOL: By me. It turns out that art was a good investment if it paid off in aesthetic benefit. But in terms of dollars, you were much better off buying stocks and bonds.

BLUMBERG: OK, so stocks and bonds are better than art. OK, what if you bought, like, a Monet in 1920?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, I think he's talking about a portfolio of all art or something. Yeah. I mean, if you happen to buy an impressionist piece during - back in the day, sure, you know, you'd be rich now. But if you bought a David Roberts piece, you would not be rich.

BLUMBERG: Who?

KESTENBAUM: Dave Roberts.

BLUMBERG: We call him - they call him Dave?

KESTENBAUM: He was famous in the 1860s, so I found him on, like, Page 300 or something of that book. Here's the quote that went along with that - "in the heyday of mid-Victorian romantic taste, the watercolors of David Roberts depicting the near east in Spain were the delight of kings. His fussy (laughter) - his fussy oil paintings and interiors of churches could make close on 2,000 pounds in the sales room." But in 1933 - that's 70 years after his death - one of them sold for just 10 guineas, which is almost nothing.

BLUMBERG: So art analysts - art critics and curators - are about as accurate in the long term as stock analysts, it sounds like.

KESTENBAUM: Art was a very good short-term investment, I would say.

BLUMBERG: Right. Exactly, but not something you want to buy and hold. Dave Roberts - don't buy and hold.

KESTENBAUM: He could have a resurgence.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

HELM: Hey, it's Sally again, back in the present. William Baumol died in 2017. He was 95. And in the spirit of Baumol's paper, we wanted to know what would've happened if you had taken his advice. So what would've happened if you'd invested in stocks, say, instead of in a collection of art?

All right. If back in 2010, you had taken $10,000 and invested it in the S&P 500 index of stocks, you would have over $28,000 now. Now, that does not include management fees, which would be small, and it doesn't include taxes. But still, it's a 180 percent return over nine-ish years - not bad.

Now, what about if you had taken that $10,000 and put it into art? Artprice.com has this index of art bought and sold around the world. We got the spreadsheet. We ran the numbers. And art still is not an amazing investment. According to this index of millions of sales of paintings, sculptures, drawings, your $10,000 would likely have lost money - about an 11 percent loss.

And that's not even taking into account things like high sales commissions, storage costs. But maybe you would've liked having an iceberg made out of sugar sitting in your living room. Maybe that would've been worth it to you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome to the planet money art gallery walk around or yourself some wine and one of those little plastic cups
Take a look at the art. I have to say these pieces are really speaking to me David
I enjoy that one the bold color the vibrant dynamism of the brushstrokes, but you know the thing
I like about it most what?
It's so cheap. It's a bargain
Today we're gonna try to figure out the answer to that question that no artist likes to discuss price that wonderful thing
That you just created out of thin air that you just poured your creative soul into
How much does that thing cost and here we should say that today's show is a rerun
Regular listeners know that we have been working hard on the planet money t-shirt project for the last few months this very week
Robert Smith and just Jang are in the Mississippi Delta reporting on the cotton harvest
So while we're doing all that writing and editing and reporting we are reaching back into the archive and actually it's kind of fun
We've been finding all these old ones that I really like
This show starts with a number and that number is 12 million 12 million dollars
That is how much a 15 foot shark in formaldehyde by artists Damien Hirst
Reportedly sold for in 2005 the title which I love is the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living
That title alone is worth 12 million dollars exactly. I have another slightly smaller number
$1.5 million that is how much Eddie Saunders tried to sell his shark for Eddie Saunders owned an electrical shop and
Said he had a shark hanging in his shop before Hirst did his shark thing and so Saunders ran an ad saying
New Year's sale only 1 million British pounds save 5 million pounds on the Damien Hirst copy
Nobody bought his shark that anecdote by the way comes from a book
I've been reading called the 12 million dollar stuffed shark about the art business and and that
Anecdote is sort of encapsulates is what our podcast is about today
Why does one guy's stuff shark sell for 12 million dollars and another guy basically can't even sell his stuff shark?
Alex let's start with the sound. I'm gonna play you a sound. Tell me if you can guess what it is
Identify it I can barely hear it
It's an empty room. It sounds like an empty room
That's the sound of the Winkleman art gallery on 27th Street
How did I not know that yeah, it's a it looks like an art gallery, you know big empty room white walls
Photographs hung about eight feet apart or something like that
And I wanted to start the discussion here because just this week
This is I'm connected with the gallery
But an Ansel Adams photograph of Yosemite National Park sold for seven hundred and seventy two thousand dollars
And when I visited the Winkleman gallery on the wall were photographs by this guy Matthew Albany's
They look just as dramatic one was of this huge ominous tornado turning across a field
Another one was of a glacier in Antarctica. Another one was of a volcano
Except that Ed Winkleman the guy who runs the gallery said it's not a tornado. That's not Antarctica and that's not a volcano
He builds these models out of everyday materials in his studio
So for example, what looks like a tornado is actually still wool
What looks like an iceberg is all made out of sugar what looks like the volcano is
Tiling grout, that's pretty great. Let me look let me look closer at the tornado
Foreground looks like grass and bushes is all made out of parsley and they're very convincing
Alex here. Look, this is uh, oh really? Yeah, I totally want to see this. That's the iceberg
Made of sugar. Oh my god
It looks exactly like an iceberg. That's amazing
Wow, apparently it's all in like the lighting he sets these things up and there are other photos where you can see him
Working on them in his studio. They're like little dioramas, but it's all it's all about the lighting
I think yeah and we'll link to the photos of these on our blog and PR org slash money
but Dave I have a
You have an ugly question. I have an ugly question. Yeah, how much is that gonna run me? It's
$2,480 frame included
It's cheaper than Ansel Adams and look he probably put a lot more work into it
Yeah, that's true
But Ansel Adams is taking pictures of real stuff. Yeah
But so this guy had to make the iceberg and then take a photograph of it. That's so much harder
Yeah, but it's not a real iceberg. All right, so it's a hard question. What should this photograph cost?
I asked Ed Winkleman. Can we talk about price? Yes
My question is harder than that it's how do you decide what price tag to put on something? Okay
So there really is a system don't you love it? There's a system. I love it
I can't imagine that the artists in Ed Winkleman's galley like the fact that there's a system for pricing their art
No, he said so he works with emerging artists not Ansel Adams
No people, you know who aren't famous yet and he says that there's always this awkward moment
You know
I'll have some new artist really really likes their work and you're maybe sitting there in front of their paintings and then
You got to put a price tag on it and the formula
It has very little to do with how good the art is
Okay, so it depends on the scale the size you mean. Yes, I think bigger across more. Yes
What if it's small and super detailed and beautiful? The scale is one aspect. Yeah, so there's like three criteria scale
What I would consider intensity as you said if it's very small and super detailed it took a lot more time
So scale
Intensity the third criteria is what he calls medium in other words
What's it made of is the sculpture carved out of wood?
Is it made of marble and how many copies are there if it's a photograph and you have multiple additions of it?
It's going to be less expensive oil paintings in general are known to be
About twice as expensive for a square inch over the same artists drawings
Really? Yes
Alright, so what I'm learning is if I'm an emerging artist
I want to do big oil paintings and not tiny
Charcoal drawings. Yeah, really really really really big
He says at the end of the day the artist decides but this this is you know
You can go around to galleries and they're all sort of priced similarly
Yeah
And he also told you that there's actually a minimum price as well
There's sort of a minimum because you know as a gallery owner. He's got his own cost rate. He's got his rent
He's got his employees. He's got the wine that they serve at the opening and he's got to make all that back
So what is the cheapest possible painting you can buy in New York? I don't know in a nice neighborhood
You know, they're gonna run over a thousand bucks, right?
Yeah, it's not like you know in a clothing store. You got tons of clothing good jeans has stacked up to the ceiling here
It's just like one piece of art and then like ten feet another piece of art, you know
So they're not gonna be cheap. All right
Well that that explains the prices of sort of artists that are I guess not well known or emerging
But it doesn't answer the question
The shark question the shark question why does a shark in formaldehyde cost 12 million dollars because it's awesome
All right
So yeah
So what we've talked about now is prices for for emerging artists where the art really is like a commodity
But after that, you know, if people start buying your art then it's like they're a different set of economic rules
They kick in and to talk about this. I went downtown to meet with William Balmol. He's an economist at NYU
He's 88 years old but still writing
I'm in competition with Methuselah these days
Most people my age have
Laid down their pens. However, I do remember having once
attended a lecture by the noted
economist AC Pigou and he got up and he said you have to realize that I
Am best described as an ancient squid
who still consider it continues to eject squirts of ink and
I feel I qualify under that description
Well, William Balmol you certainly won my heart
So one of the things Balmol has studied over the years is the economics of art
He's actually an artist himself used to teach sculpture their paintings that he's done around his office
And he occasionally actually sells one to a colleague for a few hundred bucks
But Balmol is famous on this topic for a paper. He wrote called
Unnatural value or art investment as floating crap game
We got a lot of good titles in this in this podcast
So we have a copy of that paper here. It's from
1985 and it's a scan of the original paper. So it's a scan of a printout from
1985 it's on dot matrix printer paper
Bringing back memories. I'd love it. Like the the O's are kind of squared off and the underlining that's just an underline under each letter
It's not like a long smooth line younger listeners have no idea
All right, so we'll get to the art investment part in a second
But what Balmol says in that paper is that in some ways it's no mystery what determines the price of art
It's like everything else it's supply and demand if you're famous and you've got a
line of people waiting to buy your next painting you can charge more for that one or if you've got some rich guy who
Really wants to buy a formaldehyde shark bidding against some other rich guy who also wants the shark
You know the price goes up to 12 million dollars
he says what makes art different from a commodity like, you know oil or ball bearings or
Rice and even different from things like stocks or bonds is that with those things you can try to calculate the price
But with art
Good luck. They depend in swings in human tastes and
I am
Absolutely convinced that there is nothing about human taste that can be called quotes
Rational well, I mean except everybody knows blue is better than red
Alex you used to like red better than blue. I
Changed my mind. Yes. See that's his point art art depends purely on human taste
Here's something he wrote in the paper their prices float more or less aimlessly
Well, but it's not aimless. I mean there is I mean just like those fundamentals for stocks and bonds
You could argue there are fundamentals for art
The fundamentals are just basically what the art critics think about instead of stock analysts
Yeah, exactly of art critics are art analysts in Planet Money jargon. So so speaking of the art analysts as I'm gonna continue to
Call them now. Here's what one
Curator slash art analyst had to say about Damien Hearst's for a mild-to-hide shark quote
It's brutally honest and confrontational
He draws attention to the paranoic denial of death that permeates our culture and therefore definitely worth 12 million dollars
Especially if you can sell it for more later and and that is the thing you hear about a lot
You hear about record prices for art in the news
You know
There's a there's a Picasso that sold for over 100 million and Andy Warhol piece sold for 72 million dollars recently at a Christie's
Auction and so you hear a lot of people talking about art as an investment
Yeah, Balmol says, you know people say that all the time
You should buy art the way they say you should buy real estate or whatever, you know, it holds its value
It's a good investment. And in fact, it's better than stocks and bonds
But he says that's wrong and I can tell you as an economist just from theory that should not be true
So here's his economic argument
Alex I'm gonna give you a choice you can buy a painting or you can buy a bond and in ten years
They're both gonna grow in value and be able to sell them for the exact same amount
Which would you pay more for well, I guess is the bond pretty
No, it's a little piece of paper is the painting pretty my paintings really nice and I could hang it on my wall
You could hang out on your wall
I guess I would pay more for the painting cuz I could hang out my well in the ten years that I'm gonna
Be keeping it before I saw it back, right?
So at the end of ten years are both gonna be worth the same
And you've just told me you're willing to pay more for the painting, right?
So that makes it pretty that makes the painting a sort of crappy financial investment, right?
You're paying more than you would for the bond
But you're getting the same amount back at the end or it makes the bond a crappy aesthetic investment
All right, but financially speaking if you don't care about art, you don't care about that
You're just thinking about like I got my retirement money. Where am I gonna put it? You're better off always he says
Putting it in stocks and bonds than an art at least in theory that should that should be true
So he wanted to test that idea it turns out it's sort of hard to test because you need a good data set of art
Sales and that's when he found the book
The book by right linger don't read it. So we have it here. It's a kid's called the economies of taste
the rise and fall of the picture market 1760 through 1960 by Gerald right Linger and
It has
pages and pages of data
for
works of art going back
several centuries data
That were kept by the leading auction houses
So I'm looking at the book here
Rembrandt here's Rembrandt. All right, so Rembrandt
The painting is old man in a black hat
Bought by Lord Scarsdale
1761 for 210 pounds
1760 so Alex he had a colleague type in all those numbers and statistically analyze them. Well, we found
Exactly what had been
Predicted by the theory by you by me
It turns out that art was a good investment if it paid off in
Aesthetic benefit, but in terms of dollars you were much better off buying stocks and bonds
Okay, so stocks and bonds are better than art. But okay. What if you bought like a Monet in 1920?
Yeah, I think he's talking about a portfolio of all art or something
Yeah, I mean if you happen to buy an impressionist piece during back in the day sure, you know
You'd be rich now, but if you bought a David Roberts piece you you would not be rich
Who Dave Roberts we call it we call him
He was he was famous in the 1860s. So I found him on like page 300 or something of that book
Here's the quote that went along with that in the heyday of mid-victorian
Romantic taste the watercolors of David Roberts depicting the Near East in Spain were the delight of Kings his fussy
His fussy oil paintings and interiors of churches could make close on 2,000 pounds in the sales room
But in 1933 that's 70 years after his death
One of them sold for just 10 guineas, which is almost nothing
so
Art analysts I art critics and curators are about as accurate in the long term as stock analysts
It sounds like that was a very good short-term investment. I would say right exactly but not not something you want to buy and hold
Dave Roberts don't buy and hold he could he could have a resurgence
I think after this podcast there's gonna be a resurgence and they'll be sound for at least 15 guineas
Hey there
It's present day Alex and Dave again
And we're fairly sure our show didn't have anything to do with this
But it turns out that Dave Roberts has made a bit of a comeback
There was a gallery in London darnley fine art that's offering lithographs of his work
We talked to the owner Adrian pet who says that Roberts lithographs can go for as much as eight thousand pounds
Almost thirteen thousand dollars as watercolors can sell for a lot more as much as eighty thousand dollars
I'd know how that converts to guineas was probably more than 50
Probably another note
You'll be glad to know that in the more than three years since we aired this show
Not much has changed with William Baumol the economist we interviewed
He is 91 years old now, but he writes quote still huffing along his busy painting and writing books as always
