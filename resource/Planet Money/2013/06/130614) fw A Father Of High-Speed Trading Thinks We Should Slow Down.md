AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

From NPR News this ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

And I'm Melissa Block. By one estimate half of all stock trades now involve a computer which decides on its own to buy or sell. Computerized trading has helped markets function more efficiently, but it's also led to some spectacular messes. Just this month, one firm suddenly lost $440 million dollars because of a computer glitch. NPR's David Kestenbaum of Planet Money visited one of the fathers of computerized trading to explore how he got to this point.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Thomas Petterfy grew up in Hungary after World War II. His first experience with trading happened when he was around 12. A friend went across the border to Austria and brought back something truly precious.

THOMAS PETTERFY: Juicy Fruit gum. These are beautiful yellow, Juicy Fruit gum sticks.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy cut each stick into five small pieces, and sold the pieces to his friends at school for a profit.

PETTERFY: Eventually, the principal found out about this and called me down into his office and he said, well, where is your Communist conscience? And I didn't know what he was talking about.

KESTENBAUM: Was that your first time buying low and selling high?

PETTERFY: That is correct.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy eventually makes his way to the United States, where he meets his first computer - a big boxy, calculator of a thing - and he falls in love, stays up all night programming it. And eventually, gets a job at a company that is trying to use computers and math to make money on Wall Street. In particular there are these complicated things called options or derivatives. They give you the right to buy, say, a certain stock at a certain price on a specific date. It's hard to calculate what one should cost, but Petterfy, with a computer, he finds a kind of secret formula.

PETTERFY: It took me about nine months to figure this out. But once I figured it out, it was a fantastic feeling.

KESTENBAUM: Because it meant there was a way to price them.

PETTERFY: That's right.

KESTENBAUM: And a way to make money. But this is 1977, and Petterfy has a problem. Trading isn't done on computers. You have to go stand in a pit on a trading floor and wave your hands around and shout. Petterfy can't bring his computer onto the floor, so he prints out mathematical tables on paper and puts the pages in a big binder. He brings this big binder down onto the trading floor.

PETTERFY: People looked at me - what the heck is that? And so I said, well, you know, these are my numbers that will help me trade hopefully. They made funny faces and, you know, many of them didn't understand my accent and it was - I didn't feel very welcome there.

KESTENBAUM: Every time Petterfy tries to use computers to trade, it's like the world just isn't ready for it yet. He hires some engineers who help him build these early tablet computers which work - though one burst into flames on the trading floor. It isn't until 1987 that Petterfy finally is able to take people out of the loop entirely. It happens at NASDAQ, the world's first electronic stock exchange. Meaning, there is no trading floor. You buy and sell by typing orders into a computer - a NASDAQ terminal. Petterfy, of course, doesn't want to have to type in orders. So, he and his engineers hack into the terminal. They wire it up to their computer, which starts trading up a storm; so many trades that a high up official with NASDAQ comes by to see what's going on. And the guy sees just this one terminal attached to a computer.

PETTERFY: He looks and looks and looks and he says, well, so tell me again how you are doing this? So I explained to him what's happening here. And then he says, I don't think you can do this, but I really don't think, but let me go back to my office and let you know.

KESTENBAUM: The man calls back and says I'm sorry. The NASDAQ rule book says you can't go cutting wires. All orders have to be entered through the keyboard. You have one week to fix it.

PETTERFY: So this was a problem.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy and his engineers come up with a solution. Trades have to be entered on the keyboard? Fine. They build a machine to do that.

PETTERFY: So it was basically they were rubber fingers that were typing.

KESTENBAUM: You built a robot to type in the trades.

PETTERFY: We built a robot that types.

KESTENBAUM: What did that thing sound like when it was running?

PETTERFY: Like a machine gun. Brrrrr. Because it was typing so fast.

KESTENBAUM: Finally, in the 1990s exchanges started to let people just plug their computers directly into the markets. Today, Petterfy is one of the big players. The company he started, Interactive Brokers, does electronic trades on a mind-boggling scale. Forbes estimates his net worth is now over $5 billion dollars. Petterfy says automation has done some very good things for the world. It's made buying and selling stocks much, much cheaper for everyone. But Petterfy thinks this race for speed, it's doing more harm than good now. It's an arms race, like the U.S. had with the Soviets.

PETTERFY: We are competing at milliseconds. And whether you can shave off three milliseconds in the execution of an order has absolutely no social value.

KESTENBAUM: Petterfy is in favor of more regulation. Rules that will build in some safeguards and slow things down. The challenge, of course, people will try to find ways around those rules. There's always somebody willing to build a robot that types. David Kestenbaum, NPR News.

**faster whisper:**
Once a month on a Friday morning at a specific moment, this very important number comes out.
In fact, it happened just today.
Just a few moments away from the release of the consumer sentiment report.
The consumer sentiment index is a measure of how ordinary Americans are feeling about the
economy. And everyone in the financial world wants to know what this number is going to be.
So on this one Friday a month, traders and financial analysts sit watching their
computers, their TV screens, waiting for the results.
Rick, can you hear me?
82.7. 82.7 is the number. And remember now, this is a June preliminary. Why is that important?
Because our last look was the-
CNBC reports it at 9.55 am on the dot.
This is Simone Foxman. She's a reporter at Quartz.
Any ordinary person who has a TV or an internet connection can know at 9.55 am
and zero seconds.
Or like as long as it takes for someone to pronounce that number, yes?
It turns out for a very select group of traders, when this number comes out,
it is already old news. Because they got the number in advance.
Two seconds in advance.
Thomson Reuters, which distributes this number, releases it early to computer traders who pay.
Early by two seconds. Simone published a story about this at Quartz this week
after she got a hold of a legal contract that spells out the details.
Simone read us a bit of that contract.
Says Thomson Reuters will send out the data to subscribers of its ultra low latency distribution
platform for purposes of algorithmic training at approximately 9.5458 plus or minus 500
milliseconds.
I love the plus or minus 500 milliseconds.
So 9.5458 plus or minus 500 milliseconds is saying, is promising in a legal contract,
We will get you this number somewhere between 9.54 and 57 seconds and a half
and 9.54 and 58 seconds and a half.
Yes, exactly.
So two seconds. Let me just demonstrate that.
That means flash traders get it now.
Everyone else gets it. Is that right?
That's what you're paying for.
That's what you're paying for.
According to the Wall Street Journal, people who trade with ultra fast computer
algorithms are paying $5,000 a month to get this number early.
Yeah, two seconds early.
I mean, two seconds.
If you sent me the number by email two seconds early, it would take me a second
to notice that the email had arrived and then I'd click on it and then I'd start reading.
Yeah, two seconds are up.
Two seconds are already up.
This is why these people paying $5,000 a month are not getting this number via email.
In fact, they as people aren't really even getting it at all.
What's happening is, Thompson Reuters has a computer that's sending this number
directly to the computers at the high speed trading firms.
Those computers instantly decide based on the number whether to do nothing or to place
a bet that stock prices will go up or a different bet that stock prices will go down.
Then the computers go out to the market and make whatever trade they're going to make.
And all of that, everything I just said, happens in less than two seconds.
It happens before the rest of the world gets this number.
It's funny to think about paying extra to get this number two seconds early because
if your business is making these high speed computer trades and this is offered to you,
pay us extra and you can get the information two seconds in advance,
honestly, you really don't have a choice.
You have to pay extra to get it early because if you don't,
you're going to be two seconds behind the competition.
Not working over the money would mean you're late and
high frequency traders make money by trading like this.
So it's an arms race.
It's an arms race.
Yeah, of course.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Jacob Goldstein.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today on the show, we are replaying one of our favorites.
It's the crazy story of the rise of high speed computerized trading.
It's told by one man who is at the center of it.
And we ask him, what does he think about this world he helped create?
The man you're going to meet, his name is Thomas Pederfee.
And I read about him in this book that came out recently,
Automate This written by Christopher Steiner.
And it's one of those books you think you're just going to skim.
But then you just keep reading and reading and reading.
And Pederfee's story was so amazing that I went to talk to him.
And I asked him to start at the beginning.
And he started right at the beginning.
Pederfee was born in the middle of World War II.
He grew up in a building that was partly bombed out.
And his first real experience with trading happened when he was around 12 years old.
A friend of his went across the border to Austria
and brought back something truly precious.
Juicy fruit gum.
These were beautiful yellow juicy fruit gum sticks.
And so he sold them to me for two forints,
which was the Hungarian currency, per stick.
Pederfee takes the gum.
He cuts each stick into five small pieces.
And he sells the pieces to his friends in school for one forint each,
making a little profit for himself.
Now Hungary was communist at the time.
And this did not go over well at school.
And soon enough, the teachers noticed in the school
that all the kids were sitting around chewing gum.
And of course, eventually the principal found out about this
and called me down into his office.
And he said, well, where is your communist conscience?
And I didn't know what he was talking about.
He didn't like the profiteering.
He didn't like the gum itself.
He didn't like anything.
Was that your first time buying low and selling high?
That is correct.
Pederfee eventually makes it out of Hungary.
He finds a way to get to the United States.
He speaks almost no English.
This is 1965.
He lives here in New York in a Hungarian neighborhood on the East Side.
And he gets a job as a draftsman at an engineering firm,
which is where he meets his first computer.
It's basically a primitive calculator.
But for Pederfee, this is love at first sight.
He stays up all night programming it.
And that finally puts Pederfee at the place where he will shape history,
the financial markets.
He begins working for a trading firm that's interested in using computers.
And David, this is really a pivotal moment in the history of the market.
It's the early 1970s.
Computers are no longer the size of a whole room.
They're cheap enough that an ordinary company can buy one.
And you have people on Wall Street starting to say,
hey, maybe a computer can help me figure out how to make money in the markets.
And Pederfee focuses on using the computer to try and make money in the options market.
So options are what we call derivatives.
When you buy an option on, say, a stock, you don't buy the actual stock.
What you're buying is a guarantee that you can buy that stock at a certain price,
at a specific date in the future.
It's like, whoa, what should that thing cost, right?
It's like some weird insurance policy.
It's going to depend on the stock price now, on how far off that future date is,
on how much the price of the stock moves around.
So figuring out what the price of an option should be, that involves math.
And at the time, Pederfee says, no one was really using math.
So the prices for these things were all over the place.
I mean, nobody really knew what they were doing.
In other words, the numbers were, you know,
fairly had nothing to do with the real value of options.
Pederfee starts trying to figure out a way to calculate what these options should cost.
He runs little simulations in a computer.
If I sold someone this option at price X,
how often does it end up being worth more than X?
How often less than X?
What is a fair price for it?
It took me about nine months to figure this out.
But once I figured it out, it was a fantastic feeling.
Because it meant there was a way to price them.
That's right.
David, we should point out here,
Pederfee is not the only person at this time who's trying to do this.
In fact, a couple of economists went on to win a Nobel Prize for some related work
they did on options pricing around the time.
But this idea, it was not yet widespread.
And anyone who had worked out the math had a huge advantage.
It's like, imagine that the markets are a whole bunch of people
standing around trying to guess how much something weighs.
And Pederfee, he's got a scale.
The formula tells him what a reasonable price for an option should be.
So then he can look at the market and see,
oh, that one's trading for $18.
It should be worth more.
It should be $20.
And if he sees one that's cheap, he can buy it.
If one's overpriced, he can sell it.
And this is the beginning of how Pederfee makes his fortune.
And I should say here, it is substantial.
As of 2012, Forbes estimates his net worth is over $5.4 billion.
But at this point in our story, it's 1977.
Pederfee is not yet rich.
He has his secret formula.
But he's got a problem.
And it's a big one.
At this moment, trading isn't really done by a computer.
It happens in the physical world.
There's a big trading pit here in New York.
And you actually have to be standing there on the floor
to buy or sell options.
And the pit, it's a mob scene.
Pederfee can't bring his computer with the formula in it
onto the trading floor with him.
So he comes up with a plan.
He has the computer do the math in advance.
And he prints out all these tables on paper
so he can look up what a price should be
for a particular option selling at such and such a price.
He puts the tables in a big three-ring binder
and he brings the binder down onto the trading floor with him.
So you have to imagine the scene.
There's this Hungarian guy with a strange accent
walks onto the trading floor with this big binder full of numbers.
People looked at me, what the heck is that?
And so I said, well, you know, these are my numbers
that will help me trade, hopefully.
They made funny faces and they, you know,
many of them didn't understand my accent.
And it was, I didn't feel very welcome there,
but they thought I was a goon of some sort.
And after a few days, the folks in charge tell him,
you can't have this big binder on the floor.
It's too crowded there as it is.
So I started to fold up my papers
and put them in the various pockets.
And by the end of the day, I looked like a madman
with all these papers hanging out of all of my pockets.
And I had to always wear a jacket.
So I had enough pockets to put my various papers.
The pocket thing, it works okay.
He makes some money, but it's slow going.
And just think about really how slow it is,
how crude his setup is.
He has to get all this data
and enter it into the computer by hand.
He has to type it in.
Then the computer does its calculations.
Spits out these tables.
Pederfi has to put the tables in his pockets.
He's always got to be pulling out the tables
on the trading floor.
And then he's got to wave his hands around
and actually buy and sell the stuff
from other people on the floor.
And really there is no need
for him to be involved at all, right?
His dream is to have a computer handle everything.
He can just sit back and watch the money pile up.
But for that to happen,
he needs to overcome two obstacles.
First, he needs a way to get the data,
all the prices from the markets into the computer
so it can do its calculations.
These are still really early days
for getting a live data stream.
But there are these things called
Quotron machines that you could buy.
I actually remember seeing one of these
in an office at a bank when I was a kid.
It was a keyboard attached
to one of those early boxy computer monitors
where the text was all in green.
It was basically the first replacement
for the paper ticker that would
click, click, click, click, click, click, right?
Actually tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
That's why it was called the ticker.
You'd type in the stock you're interested in
to the Quotron machine like DD for DuPont.
And the machine would tell you
what the current stock price was.
It was amazing.
Petter Fee thought, this is great.
And in 1982, he buys one of these machines.
He gets it wired up.
Now he's got these live stock prices
in green on the screen.
But remember, he needs a way to get
the stock prices into his computer
so it can do all the fancy math.
So he reads through the contract
for his Quotron machine.
He checks that there's no restrictions
on what you can actually do
with your Quotron machine.
And then he cuts the cable that goes
into the back of the Quotron machine.
The cable that's carrying all the
information about the stock prices.
And he wires that cable
directly into his computer.
It takes a while.
He has to hire some people to help.
But eventually it works.
He'd hacked into the data stream.
And now his computer could crunch
the data instantly.
Petter Fee didn't have to enter
all the prices by hand anymore.
And this really is another key moment.
I mean, we take for granted today
that sure, you can go to any computer,
your computer, and look up
the price of any stock.
But Petter Fee, in order to do this,
he had to hack into the Quotron system.
He actually had to cut the cable
and like bolt it into his computer.
Yeah, today you would just like
type in the stock.
He had to get like an oscilloscope
and a soldering iron and all this stuff.
So now he can get the data in.
But to act on it,
to buy or sell options,
that still has to happen manually.
So he hires a bunch of traders
and he works on a clever system
so they don't have to carry
around pieces of paper.
He and his engineers build
what are kind of like proto iPads,
tablet computers that will tell
the traders what to buy and sell.
I saw one of these things in his office.
It looks like something
that might have flown
on an early moon mission.
It's this like metal box
screwed together.
It's got a touch screen on top.
It looks very experimental.
And it was.
There were problems.
Like they were driven by lithium batteries
and one of the boxes exploded
on the trading floor, you know,
and it went up in big smoke
and people said this is dangerous.
So Pederfi here is using computers
to trade sort of,
but it's definitely not
yet computerized trading.
He still has to have people
with these exploding proto iPads
who have to go wave their arms around
and holler in the trading pit.
And Pederfi is still dreaming of the day
when he can finally take
these traders out of the loop.
This finally happens in 1987 at Nasdaq.
The Nasdaq stock exchange
is the world's first electronic market,
meaning there is no trading floor.
You buy and sell by typing orders
into a computer, a Nasdaq terminal.
Pederfi is psyched.
He gets himself a Nasdaq terminal.
His team does their hacking again,
cuts the cable.
And now finally,
for the first time,
it is all automated.
His office looks like this.
There's a Nasdaq terminal
and next to it, a computer.
Whole thing is silent
and it is trading up a storm.
It's making lots and lots of trades.
So many trades that people start to notice.
A high-up official with the Nasdaq exchange
comes by Pederfi's office to see.
Pederfi says the guy is expecting
a room full of traders and terminals.
Instead, there is just this one terminal
attached to a computer.
And he looks and looks and looks
and he says, well, so tell me again
why are you doing this?
So I explained to him what's happening here
and then he says,
I don't think you can do this,
but I really don't think,
but let me go back to my office
and let you know.
And he calls back and he says,
well, look in your Nasdaq rule book.
It says that orders have to be input
via the keyboard
and you're not doing that.
You're just splicing in the wire.
So this is not good.
You're violating the rules.
We're giving you a week
to correct this rule violation.
One week?
One week.
So this was a problem.
Pederfi thinks and thinks.
He talks it over with his engineers
and they come up with a solution.
The rules just say the buy and sell orders
have to be entered through the keyboard.
So Pederfi's team builds a machine that does that.
So it was basically they were rubber fingers
that were typing.
They built a robot to type in the trades.
We built a robot that types.
Pederfi is very pleased.
For him this kind of highlights
the absurdity of the situation
and a week later the official at Nasdaq comes back.
I triumphantly show him our creation
and I tell you he opened his mouth
and never closed it again.
What did that thing sound like when it was running?
It was that was the only problem was it was very loud.
So you could tell how much activity
there was in the market
because it was typing like crazy.
Like a machine gun.
People started to wear earmuffs.
Not earmuffs.
What do you call it?
Earplugs.
And in the next years in the 1990s
computerized trading gets a lot easier.
You didn't have to build a typing robot anymore.
The exchanges started to allow Pederfi
and others trying to do this
just to plug their computers right into the market.
And this brings us to where we are today.
Now according to an estimate by the tab group
half of all stock trades are done
because an algorithm told the computer to buy or sell.
Pederfi today is one of the big players
the company he started called Interactive Brokers.
It does electronic trades on a mind boggling scale.
The company has two parts.
One is a broker basically
that lets people do trades quickly electronically.
The other part does what's called market making.
When somebody wants to sell a stock
say their computers will buy it
then turn around and sell it
when someone else wants it.
You don't make a lot of money on every trade
but you do lots and lots of them.
Pederfi says automation has done
some very good things for the world.
In the olden days back when you needed people
to do all your trades
those people charged you a lot of money to do that.
For example at Interactive Brokers
the average commission we charge on a trade
is $4.05 or something like that.
So it's very very cheap compared to
you know 20 years ago
if you wanted to do a trade
it will cost you 50 or 60 dollars.
So the savings are humongous.
It's really huge.
Commissions what he's talking about there
are definitely lower
and this is better for everybody.
There's real social value to this
like anyone who's ever bought and sold a stock
anyone with a retirement account
they get a better deal in a lot of ways.
The financial markets now
they are like very well oiled machines.
Okay yes there are some benefits from this
but you know if the markets are now
well oiled machines
they seem like well oiled machines
that keep rushing off the road at high speed
and crashing into trees.
That is true.
The most famous case was back in 2010
something that's come to be known as
the flash crash
where the stock market
momentarily went totally haywire.
Five even offer comes in
four evens are trading out now
three evens are trading out now
three even video now
you're gonna get a low print of 11.03 even.
This is Ben Lichtenstein
he runs a service called Traders Audio.
This was a very crazy moment
some stocks started trading for just a penny
some went crazy high
and then somehow it all went back to normal.
The Securities and Exchange Commission
put together this 104 page report
trying to reconstruct what happened
and not surprisingly
it was due to computerized trading.
Pederfee remembers the day this happened.
So where were you when the flash crash happened?
I was right here.
I was sitting by my machinery here
and I just couldn't believe
what was going on
and I picked up the phone
and I said what's happening?
People said we don't know.
It was it was
it was not a good thing.
The next thing Pederfee said is a little surprising.
I kind of expect guys like Pederfee to just say
look faster is better
more automation is better
but he says we've reached a point of absurdity
where everyone is trying to be faster
and faster and faster
to beat the next guy by a thousandth of a second.
We are competing on milliseconds
and whether you can shave off three milliseconds
in the execution of an order
has absolutely no social value.
In fact it may be making the whole system less stable.
It's certainly making everything more expensive for everyone.
Companies that trade, his included,
have to keep spending more and more money
just to be a tiny bit faster.
Now you have to put your computers
physically right next to the stock exchange.
You have to think about sending signals
with lasers instead of regular wires.
Companies are also talking about
laying new optical fibers
underneath the Arctic Ocean
in a particular direction
just so people who pay for it
can get trades to European or Japanese markets
a teeny bit faster.
It's basically not unlike the arms race
used to be against the Russians
20 years ago or 30 years ago, right?
It's the same question, right?
Who builds the bigger bomb?
Who builds more of them?
How do you put a stop to that though?
Well that's the question.
That's, you know, it's an interesting situation.
It's a situation where I do not quite see
how this will resolve itself.
It's to the benefit.
I don't see how it will resolve itself
to the benefit of the marketplace.
Let's say a quandary.
Pederfi is in favor of some more regulation.
Regulation that will build in some safeguards
and in the process slow things down.
The challenge will be, of course,
that people will always try
to find a way around the rules.
There's always someone
willing to build a robot that types.
As always, let us know what you think.
