The cotton for the Planet Money men's T-shirt was spun into yarn in Indonesia and knit, cut and sewn into shirts in Bangladesh.

Last week, we had teams of reporters and photographers in both countries — and we managed to get almost everybody on the phone at once.

On today's show, we listen in on that call.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

It's OK - are you there?

CAITLIN KENNEY, BYLINE: Yeah. I'm here.

BLUMBERG: Hold on the engineer - Robert, you guys are there?

ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Yeah. I hear you.

BLUMBERG: All right. OK. Let's do it. Ready? From New York City, I'm Alex Blumberg.

SMITH: From Jakarta, Indonesia, I'm Robert Smith.

JESS JIANG, BYLINE: And I'm Jess Jiang.

KENNEY: From Chittagong, Bangladesh, I'm Caitlin Kenney.

ZOE CHACE, BYLINE: And I'm Zoe Chace.

PIETRA RIVOLI: And from Washington, D.C., I'm Pietra Rivoli.

BLUMBERG: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. This was - I know it sounds really smooth at the top, but this was not actually easy to achieve. All of us on the phone right?

SMITH: No. Nothing's easy.

RIVOLI: No.

SMITH: Nothing's easy in this part of the world.

BLUMBERG: I've been counting it's been a half an hour of wrangling to get everybody on the phone. So let's just set up what we're doing here today. Today, we have a very special episode of PLANET MONEY. We have reporters literally all over the world tracking the progress of our T-shirt as we make it. And in case there are people out there who have no idea what I'm talking about right now, we're doing this big project - longtime listeners know.

For several years, we have been making our own T-shirt, and we're going to track the progress of our T-shirt as it gets made. Where is the cotton grown? Where is the cotton spun into yarn? Where is the yarn knitted into fabric and then cut and sewn into T-shirts?

We're following the whole thing reporting on every step of the journey, and we are actually doing it right now as you're hearing is a process that's taking us all over the world to Indonesia to Bangladesh. Pretty soon, we're going to have reporters in Colombia and Miami, and there's actually one other thing that's making this show special today.

We have a special guest host in Washington, D.C., Pietra Rivoli. She is the author of the book that inspired this entire project. It's called "The Travels Of A T-Shirt In The Global Economy." Pietra, it's great to have you here.

RIVOLI: Great to be here, Alex.

BLUMBERG: So basically we're just doing a check-in right now. And, Robert and Jess, why don't you guys start? How long have you been in country as they say?

SMITH: Well, we've been here a few days now, and I guess we're the first ones to actually see at least the facility where part of our T-shirt was made. Just yesterday - was it yesterday, Jess? Yeah...

JIANG: Yeah. It's been a long time, but I guess it's just yesterday.

BLUMBERG: So basically one of the questions that we're sort of trying to investigate with this whole series is why is making a T-shirt such a global endeavor with things happening so far apart in different parts of the globe? Right, Pietra? You were you were talking about like let's just give people a quick thumbnail sketch of the road our shirt will travel. It starts - it looks like - somewhere in the Mississippi Delta, but we weren't exactly sure where. And then, Pietra, where does it go again?

RIVOLI: The cotton goes to a couple of different places. One - it goes to Indonesia for one shirt, and it goes to Colombia for the other shirt.

BLUMBERG: Which is a whole story in and of itself - why the men's shirt goes one place and the women's shirt goes another place. But - and in this podcast, we're going to be focusing mainly on the men's T-shirt.

RIVOLI: OK.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

RIVOLI: And then, of course, the cotton then just takes one step in the transformation and becomes yarn in Indonesia. And then it takes the rest of the steps in Bangladesh.

BLUMBERG: So, Robert and Jess, you guys saw the actual place where this transformation happens, the factory where the cotton is spun into yarn. So I'm imagining, you know, a small house, a guy with like a little spinning wheel.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: I'm joking. I'm joking.

JIANG: Definitely not what it was.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

JIANG: This was a compound that - it actually produces its own electricity. It has its own power-generating plant.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

SMITH: And I've been to a lot of factories, and this was one of the cleanest, most high tech, efficient things I have ever seen. It was so immaculate, and this is a messy process. You know, making yarn from cotton is something where there's all sorts of trash and a lot of places have - there's fibers floatings in the air. This had robotic vacuum arms that moved up and down and back and forth sucking any sort of thing that would fall out, anything that would contaminate the yarn.

And the most amazing thing - this was much larger than a football field factory - and in this whole process, there were no human hands that touch the yarn. It is one piece of machinery robot after another taking it from the raw cotton into final yarn that gets shipped to Bangladesh for a T-shirt.

BLUMBERG: And, Jess, one of the things that you were - we were hoping to get from this visit is there's a little bit of a mystery sort of - we know where our cotton is going to be spun into yarn for our actual T-shirts - the factory that you visited. We know where the yarn will then go and get turned into fabric and where that fabric will be cut and sewn into T-shirts. We know all that exactly. We are going to see that process. The thing that we weren't quite sure of is where our actual cotton comes from, right?

JIANG: Yeah. And we had asked the factory here in Indonesia a couple of times over the phone, and they were a little confused by our question. And it wasn't until we got to the factory that we really understood why. And it's because they have a warehouse just for the cotton. It's two stories high, and it's filled with cotton from all different places. It's filled with cotton from (unintelligible) from Greece.

And then there's also a lot of cotton from America. There's cotton from Tennessee. There's cotton from Arkansas, and some of this cotton gets mixed together when they make their yarn. And so it's hard to say specifically that it's from one single place.

BLUMBERG: So it's a little bit like going to your local gas station and saying, say, sir, where does this oil come from?

JIANG: Exactly. But they did give us a number of farms, so we're hoping to trace it back even further than the yarn factory.

BLUMBERG: I have one more question, I think, for you guys and then we'll move to Bangladesh. And the question is this basically, so spinning is one of the oldest technologies out there. You literally - you can do it with your hands. You can take a piece of cotton and spin it into yarn with your index finger and your thumb What's all the technology about?

SMITH: Speed. Speed and consistency. Jess, do you remember the number?

JIANG: Yeah. I think - we sat down and actually calculated it out, and it was kind of astounding. In one day, a single day, they produce enough yarn to wrap around the globe 24 times.

SMITH: You have to have a very big home and very soft fingers to do that sort of thing.

BLUMBERG: Wait - that is one of the most astounding statistics I've ever heard. One day, one factory produces enough yarn to wrap around the entire globe 24 times?

JIANG: It was really - it was astounding.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

SMITH: And we should say that they're working in such a cheap product. It's yarn that goes into another cheap product, into a T-shirt. But they said because it's such a cheap product because it's a commodity, it has to be perfect. Each one has to be exactly like the last one. If you're spinning yarn, if you're sending it to a factory, the yarn has to be precisely the same thickness, precisely the same tensile strength. All these things have to be perfect. And so because of that, the thing they kept saying over and over again is consistency, consistency.

We need to 24 hours a day put up the exact same yarn. It's funny because it's the same product. Raw cotton comes in Indonesia and 100 percent pure cotton leaves Indonesia. They basically just take that cotton transform it, make it look different, look and act different. Their entire facility there - all $30 million worth of machines - all of that just turns the cotton into a different kind of cotton.

BLUMBERG: So the cotton comes in as cotton. It gets spun. It goes out as yarn, and from there, it goes to where you guys are, Caitlin and Zoe, to Bangladesh. So, first of all, what - how long have you guys been there?

KENNEY: We have been here for less than 12 hours. It's 8:41 here right now, and we got in at 10 a.m. this morning.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

KENNEY: So we're feeling a little jet lagged over here.

BLUMBERG: All right, so you're ready to party.

KENNEY: Yeah, exactly.

BLUMBERG: You have not been to the factory yet where our shirts will get cut in - where our shirts will get made.

KENNEY: No, we have - yeah. We haven't yet, but one of the things that's been super remarkable to us is just every person that we've talked to even in preparing for this trip and now that we're here has some connection to the garment industry. Like, it's kind of amazing. Actually, when we were in Dubai, we were in the airport lounge, and we started talking to this kid who was about 14 years old. His name was Arman (ph) and we sort of found out he was Bengali and said, you know, what does your dad do? And he said, you know, my dad's in garment. So we ended up having this really great talk with his dad about the industry.

BLUMBERG: So you hear about, like, industry towns, like, you know, New York is like a media town and LA is, you know, an entertainment town. Bangladesh is sort of like an industry country. Pietra, that's - there's actual data about that, right?

RIVOLI: Yeah. I mean, that's actually just completely consistent with what we know about their trade patterns. I mean, they - 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports are apparel, 80 percent of their manufacturing exports. So everybody's in it. And if they're not in it, they know somebody who's in it.

BLUMBERG: And 80 percent of a country's exports being one thing, how common is that in developing countries?

RIVOLI: You know, I think Bangladesh is pretty extreme on this spectrum to see that kind of concentration. The other thing that's remarkable about Bangladesh is that that number's kind of stuck up there for a while. We really haven't seen the kind of diversification away from that that, you know, maybe we'd like or they'd like.

CHACE: Hey, guys.

BLUMBERG: Hey.

RIVOLI: Hey, Zoe.

CHACE: Hi.

RIVOLI: Hey. I miss you.

CHACE: Pietra, you have been very much on my mind.

BLUMBERG: Zoe, is Pietra on your mind because everything that she's told you is actually coming true before your eyes?

RIVOLI: Or wrong (laughter)?

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Or is it the opposite? Everything that we thought we knew about the T-shirt industry turns out to be wrong?

RIVOLI: Is the whole book wrong, Zoe?

(LAUGHTER)

CHACE: It better be right because that's like my guide book it to everything that I'm looking at.

RIVOLI: Good. Well, I'm just really glad you stole my book (laughter).

CHACE: No, it's totally right because as soon as we got here, our fixer was like, oh, yeah, this is just - this is basically like - this entire country's just a tailor shop. That's what it is.

RIVOLI: Yeah.

CHACE: So if that's what you want to see like you're in the right place.

BLUMBERG: And that's sort of the key thing that we're trying to investigate is sort of what does the fact that Bangladesh is the tailor shop to the world? What does that mean for its future? What does that mean for the future of its citizens? And if you want to move beyond being the tailor shop to the world, can you do that as other countries have done?

CHACE: Yeah. Yeah. And how do people feel about it?

BLUMBERG: So Pietra, Caitlin and Zoe are going to be heading out to the factory. They're going to be talking to workers. They're going to be talking to all sorts of different people in Bangladesh in the next couple of weeks. If we want to try to figure out like is Bangladesh stuck or is it moving inching slowly forward, what kinds of answers would you be expecting to hear from people to indicate one direction or another?

RIVOLI: Well, if you think of where Bangladesh is in this T-shirt story, you know, it's in this cut and sew phase. So there are backward linkages from there back to yarn and fiber. And there are forward linkages from there, you know, to the retail complex to the department stores in New York. And, you know, in order to not be stuck, you either have to expand the backward linkages or the forward linkages. And I think the interesting question is, you know, what are people thinking about that? You know, what kind of prospects are there for capturing value moving in either direction?

BLUMBERG: You mean these cut and sew factories that we're going to be visiting why aren't they doing their own spinning?

RIVOLI: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: Or why aren't they doing their own retailing going forward?

RIVOLI: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: So for the managers of these factories what kinds of questions would you want to ask to figure this stuff out and what sort of answers would you be looking for? Like what's a very optimistic answer from a manager that you would expect and what's a sort of like a, no, it's not moving forward type of answer from a manager?

RIVOLI: Well, I guess that really what these things depend upon is the skills base of the management structure as well as the labor force. Bangladesh has very, very high rates of female illiteracy, for example. So I think an optimistic answer would have to do with building the capabilities of the labor force, you know, starting with really basic things like education. And an optimist, I think, would have to believe that that's going to happen.

BLUMBERG: And then what kinds of answers would you expect from the actual workers themselves? Like what kinds of things would you look for the workers to be saying that would give you some indication that maybe things are moving in the right direction?

RIVOLI: I think the main thing that you look for from the workers are, you know, what do they hope and what do they expect for their children? Most of the workers who are at these sewing machines, they themselves are, you know, not planning to make a leap to being an actor or a lawyer or a professor or an auto worker. But they do have expectations and hopes for their children, and I think that's the key question to ask.

BLUMBERG: So guys in Bangladesh...

KENNEY: Yes.

BLUMBERG: ...We're going to check back in with you guys in about a week, right? And we can check back in with Pietra and see what those answers are and discuss that.

CHACE: OK.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

RIVOLI: Awesome.
