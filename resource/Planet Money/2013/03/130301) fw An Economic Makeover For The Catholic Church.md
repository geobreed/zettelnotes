The Catholic Church is not a corporation. It's a religion, a cultural force, and a global power. Still, one of the things the new Pope will have to deal with is a classic business mess — a multi-billion dollar conglomerate that has stumbled and is losing money and relevance.

CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST:

If you're in business, there are certain signs that your company is in trouble, a big one - your CEO abruptly resigns.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: We are coming on the air right now because Pope Benedict the XXVI is resigning on...

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

It is especially worrisome if this is the first time this has happened to your company will resign in almost 600 years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Pope Gregory, the last pope to resign in 1415, the leader of the world's more than 1 billion Catholics.

KENNEY: Another sign all is not well - a few of your subsidiaries declare bankruptcy.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Milwaukee's archdiocese is filing for bankruptcy.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: The move comes as the archdiocese faces numerous lawsuits over priest sex abuse.

SMITH: And then there's that. There is nothing worse than having your employees face criminal charges. Evidence of a corporate coverup, it is hard for anyone to recover from that.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We've had six years for an apology. And two years later, now we're talking about repentance. But we're not hearing repentance from the Vatican.

KENNEY: The Catholic Church is not a business. It's a religion, a global force, a cultural power. But one of the things the new pope is going to have to deal with is a classic business mess, a multibillion-dollar conglomerate that has stumbled and is losing money and relevance.

SMITH: You know, the Catholic Church needs an economic makeover. And there's no better time than right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)

KENNEY: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Caitlin Kenney.

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. On the show today, we are going to do for the church what any corporation in trouble does. We're going to bring in the consultants.

KENNEY: We've assembled a bunch of experts in management, strategy, economics and, of course, Catholicism. And they put out some big flaws in the way the church does business. They have suggestions for the new pope if he wants the Catholic Church to survive another 2,000 years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)

SMITH: Let me just say up front that we are not here to makeover the Catholic Church as a religion.

KENNEY: We're really interested in the Catholic Church as a business entity because they face some classic challenges that are the same any large, global corporation would face. They've been around for a long time. They're set in their ways. But they've had some of their market share eroded by these young upstarts, you know, the Muslims and the Mormons.

SMITH: It's hard enough for a company that's been around a hundred years. I mean, think of the recent management challenges for Ford or IBM. The Catholic Church has been doing business for two millennia. And that's a lot of history. But when you think about it a certain way, the story of the Catholic Church is this slow-motion version of a business story that, you know, we've reported on many times before. The Catholic Church is a little startup that could.

KENNEY: It began with one man with the vision. But Jesus wasn't much of a business guy. So he brought in a manager - well, a fisherman with management potential.

TOM DOYLE: Before Jesus died, he said to Peter, he said, you know, you are Peter. And upon you, I will build my church.

KENNEY: This is Father Tom Doyle a priest with the Congregation of the Holy Cross. To extend the business metaphor, Peter was basically the first chief executive of the Catholic Church. And he faced a bunch of basic startup problems. The early church had entrenched competition - paganism, Judaism.

SMITH: Yeah. And they didn't have any money or infrastructure. The church's early founders' strategy was - this will sound familiar - give the product away for free. Build up an audience. Get as many eyeballs for your message as possible. And the hope - and anyone in Silicon Valley can appreciate this hope - if you make something cool and enough people like it, the money will come.

DOYLE: As they're going out and taking the good news, they were taking it to the poor but also to the merchants and people who had resources. And in that sense, there were angel investors, people who parted with their own means for the good and the good work that the church was doing.

SMITH: It took a couple hundred years of struggling before the early Catholics got their big break, a sweet government contract. Constantine the Great converted to Christianity.

KENNEY: And they were off. The Catholic Church became the state religion. Money started to flow in. Of course, it took a while.

SMITH: A couple thousand years.

KENNEY: (Laughter) Yes, but the Catholic Church eventually became as popular as, well, a more recent startup, Facebook.

DOYLE: The Catholic Church has 1.2 billion members today. That's almost 2,000 years of an annual growth rate of 1%. You know, and that's pretty long and, you know, average - pretty incredible growth.

SMITH: And that is a very short and very simplified version of the history. Thank you very much, Father Doyle. Of course, the Catholic Church has been hitting some headwinds recently. We already mentioned a few of the problems at the beginning of the show. But attendance at mass is dropping in the U.S. and Europe. Other religions are growing faster.

KENNEY: So now with the changing of the guard at the Vatican, a new pope coming in, this is exactly the time where the new guy would bring in some consultants, try to shake things up. It turns out there's already a whole Catholic consulting industry. There's groups that do this, Catholic schools of management, business advisers. They've thought a lot about this. And, of course, they've encountered some pushback.

Kerry Robinson is the executive director of the National Leadership Roundtable on church management. Her group offers training to church leaders, and they also think that people who aren't ordained, laypeople, should play a bigger role in the church.

KERRY ROBINSON: Bishops and cardinals will say to us that the church is - it's unique because of its divine religious mission. And we know that it is unique and not like a corporation such as Microsoft or Home Depot. But it is comprised of people, facilities and finances. And they have to be managed at the highest levels of ethics, accountability, transparency and excellence.

SMITH: All right. Robinson says the church is comprised of three things - people, facilities and finances. So let's go through them now. We have our management consultant clipboards ready. We've got our stopwatches. Let's take a stroll through the Catholic factory floor. First rule of business - focus on where your customers are.

CHUCK ZECH: Unfortunately, the church in this time period has a real misallocation of its resources.

KENNEY: Chuck Zech is an economics professor and director of the Center for the Study of Church Management at Villanova University. And by resources, he basically means priests. They aren't where they need to be.

ZECH: Most of the Catholics, about 2/3, and most of the growth in Catholics is occurring in Latin America or Asia or Africa. They only have, though, about 1/3 of the priests. So most the priests and most of the facilities, the churches and so on, are located in areas like North America or Western Europe, where the church is not growing. And so we have resources in one area but the growth in the church in a different area.

KENNEY: Right, and if the church was a business, that's something they would look at and say, oh, wait. All of our customers are over here. You know, let's build some more stores there. Let's send some more employees there.

ZECH: You're right. If this were a business, there'd be no question that they would - resources would be shifted.

SMITH: They would be hiring the best and the brightest. You know, they would double the staff at the new Myanmar office or something like that. But this is where things get sticky for the Catholic Church specifically. There isn't enough of their basic resource. There are not enough priests. Jim Post is a professor of management at Boston University.

JIM POST: There is a shortage of priests, and the priests - the countries in which priests are - more men are becoming priests are not the countries where the demand is greatest.

KENNEY: Jim Post is not just a management expert. He's also founder of the Voice of the Faithful, a progressive Catholic organization. And so he has some outside-the-box thinking on where to find those new priests. The church has one vast, untapped resource.

POST: In a country where more than 50% of the population are women, in a church where more than 50% by far of churchgoers are women, women are crying out for an expanded role in the in the life of the church.

KENNEY: All right. You got a problem. You don't have enough people to do this job. Let women do it. Let married men do it. Will that happen?

POST: Not in my lifetime I would say. And I don't - I don't - I think married men may have a possibility. It seems as though that would be sort of closer to the - to the front burner. It would surprise me, however, if the church were quick to embrace all of that. At the end of the day, I think the church and the papacy remain very conservative institutions, trying hard to preserve the best of the past while also trying to adapt to the future. But I think the weight of that rests heavily on preserving the traditions of the past.

SMITH: And you can hear there the peculiar problem that a consultant faces when advising a church rather than a business; management theory says you should go in this direction, and God says maybe you should go in this direction - or at least your interpretation of God's will. Now, our consultants say you have to walk this line very carefully when it comes to religion. You have to stay true to the mission.

KENNEY: OK, but we're in brainstorm mode here.

SMITH: Yeah.

KENNEY: There are no bad ideas.

SMITH: Let's do it. Let's do it.

KENNEY: Other big solutions to this global resource allocation problem - why doesn't the pope just come in and say, hey, New York City, you've got too many priests. You got plenty money. Let's send some down to that office we have over in Asia to our growth sector.

SMITH: Yeah, well, the pope may speak to God, may inspire the faithful, but he doesn't have the same financial power of most CEOs. Chuck Zech from Villanova says the organization is just set up differently.

ZECH: On matters of faith and morals, the church is very centralized, very hierarchical. But on the temporal issues of finances and actually running a day-to-day operation, the church is very independent.

SMITH: In other words, the money does not all flow through the Vatican. The money is not all controlled by the pope. Don't think of the Catholic Church as this big, central operation like Microsoft or General Motors. Think of it as a conglomerate with lots of little independent operators. Chuck Zech says it's almost like a franchise model.

KENNEY: In the Catholic Church, each individual operator, each franchise - called a diocese which is basically name for a geographic area with bunch of churches in it. They're run by the bishops. And the bishops, they collect money from all the churches in the dioceses, and they make their own budgets. They basically run their own show.

SMITH: And this model, according to the consultants, this is another management challenge the next pope will have to confront because having all these independent operators, I mean, it may be the way things have always been done in the church, it may have been really useful when communications between Rome and the Americas took months to happen - but right now, it is wasteful. For a modern corporation, it doesn't make any sense. I mean, every diocese has to find their own suppliers for coffee. They have to, like, go out and buy their own printer paper.

ROBINSON: Let's just imagine that collectively in the United States, we worked to - we availed ourselves of economy of scale and we bid out to various vendors to get the best price for something that everyone in the Catholic Church utilizes.

KENNEY: This is Kerry Robinson again from the National Leadership Roundtable on Church Management. Think about it. When a Dunkin Donuts franchise needs new straws or sugar, they don't just go down the street to the supermarket. Dunkin Donuts has a central supplier. They have huge buying power. They buy so many straws and so many sugar packets that they get to bargain. They get a good price because everybody wants to be their supplier.

SMITH: And Kerry says the same thing could go for the Catholic Church. Now, forget about the rest of the world. Forget about the global organization of the Catholic Church. Just the United States alone, she says if you add up the annual budget of every Catholic hospital, every university, every diocese, every parish, the budget is over $105 billion a year.

KENNEY: Now, she says imagine they all got together to buy the things they need - computers, furniture, supplies for the hospitals, all the way down to the church pews and the holy wine. They would have huge buying power, and they could save a ton of money. This other group, the Apollo philanthropy group, they did the math. They say buying things together, joint procurement as they call it, could save the church as much as 10% of its annual budget. If we carried that out systematically for the church, we could save as much as $8 billion dollars a year. So the church is missing out on purchasing power, procurement, economy of scale.

SMITH: All right, now the consultants are on a roll. They're focusing the Catholic Church on growth sectors, saving money through centralization. But in the big scheme of things, this is pretty small potatoes, low-hanging fruit, as they say, in the consultant business. The biggest business challenge to the Catholic Church is the erosion of the brand. Churches grow on trust, and in the Catholic Church, trust is in short supply these days.

KENNEY: The brand problems start at the smallest level of something really simple that happens in church. The collection basket comes around. Parishioners feel moved, feel responsible for the church, and they put some money in the basket. That basically makes them kind of like an investor in the church. But Jim Post says, as investors, they get almost no reporting back about how that money gets spent.

POST: If they put their money into it, let's say, a collection for a disaster-relief program and then it's discovered that only 5% of that money actually goes to disaster relief and the other 95% is used for other purposes, siphoned off to other things, certainly the donors have a right to feel that they've been taken. And without systematic accounting and disclosure, there's enough doubt these days about how money is being managed that we don't know whether the hungry are being fed and the naked are being clothed and the - those in need are getting health care and education.

SMITH: This is a common complaint among our consultants. When they want to help the Catholic Church, it's really hard for them. And, I mean, these are people who actually talk with church leaders, but it's still really hard for them to get the most basic information about revenues and expenses, even at the local level. A few dioceses do put their budgets up online, but most do not. And where there is darkness, there are people who will take advantage of this.

POST: When financial controls are not visible and they're not enforced, you almost can guarantee that there will be - that there will be misallocation of money and perhaps even worse than that. There certainly are too many examples of individuals, some ordained, some not who have walked off with money from various Catholic churches. So how do we correct that? You have to have a system of accountability. And I think that involves transparent financial reporting back to the donor - to the donor community.

KENNEY: Robert, Zech, who we heard from earlier with Villanova, he and a fellow colleague have studied this issue. They did a survey a couple of years ago where they talked to church leaders about their finances and they found about 85% of Roman Catholic dioceses that responded to their survey had embezzlement problems. More than 10% of them had had more than $500,000 stolen in the last five years.

SMITH: Now, for most of the church's history, people relied on faith, faith in their church leaders to spend the money like they said they were going to spend the money. They didn't need detailed financial statements. But, you know, as we mentioned at the beginning of the show, recently there's been a lot of trust problems with the Catholic Church.

And so this lack of transparency, which is a problem in financial matters, it becomes a much worse problem than embezzlement when you talk about some of the issues that have come up recently in the Catholic Church. I'm referring to the child sex abuse scandal, which has devastated a lot of the Catholic Church in America. And it's really pushing people there to reevaluate the whole transparency issue, which is, exactly what does the church tell its members about what it's doing and why it's doing it?

KENNEY: Father Tom Doyle, who gave us our Catholic history lesson, he says transparency is a real issue. He says he was in Boston while the clergy sex abuse scandal was going on, and the church didn't do the best job of communicating what was happening in the church. There was even problems in communication amongst the priests. But Father Tom's also got a Harvard MBA, and he spent a couple of years working for Deloitte Touche, the big consulting firm. He says for a challenge this large, the business advice is the same for the church as it would be for corporation.

DOYLE: How do you get trust back? You earn it. You have to earn it, right? And so we're going to have to err on the side of being more transparent about things than we have in the past.

SMITH: And so to sum up the advice our consultants have for the new pope as he comes in in the next few months, No. 1, think globally, allocate your resources properly; No. 2, use your purchasing power. Act like one church if you're going to be one church. And No. 3, the transparency issue - and this is where our consultants say, believe it or not, the Catholic Church can learn something from public corporations.

They have auditing processes. They report back to their investors. They have people come in, and they lay open their books for the people who have given them money. Now, that doesn't mean corporations don't do something wrong, but it does mean we generally find out about it. And then, you know, whoever the CEO is, can make sure their heads roll.

KENNEY: Our corporations, they say that openness, something the Catholic Church should embrace.

(SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN MUSIC)

KENNEY: As always, we want to know what you thought of today's show. You can email us, planetmoney@npr.org.

SMITH: Or find us online at npr.org/money. And we're particularly interested in the business of religion, as maybe you can tell. Caitlin and I did a show last year about tithing in the Mormon Church. We have this show about Catholicism, and then next week, if all goes according to plan - next week, Adam Davidson and myself will bring you a show about the Amish and about Amish business ways. I'm Robert Smith.

KENNEY: I'm Caitlin Kenney. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DOWN WITH THE KING")

RUN-DMC: (Rapping) Because of all the things that I bring with me, only G-O-D could be a king to me, and if the G-O-D be in me, then a king I be. The microphone is braded when it's handed to me. I was planted on this planet, and I plan to MC. The MC fiends only seem to agree that I rock all the world and the society. Outrageous on the stages with my tune of verse, I give praises from these pages to the universe. My voice is raw. My lyrics is law. I keep it hardcore like you never saw. You want to be down with the king...

I mean it may be the way things have always been done in the church.
It may have been really useful when communications between Rome and the Americas took months to happen.
But right now it is wasteful for a modern corporation.
It doesn't make any sense.
I mean every diocese has to find their own suppliers for coffee.
They have to go out and buy their own printer paper.
Let's just imagine that collectively in the United States we worked to we availed ourselves of economy of scale.
And we bid out to various vendors to get the best price for something that everyone in the Catholic Church utilizes.

Just the United States alone.
She says if you add up the annual budget of every Catholic hospital every university every diocese every parish the budget is over one hundred and five billion dollars a year.
Now she says imagine they all got together to buy the things they need computers furniture supplies for the hospitals all the way down to the church pews and the holy wine.

If we carried that out systematically for the church we could save as much as eight billion dollars a year.
So the church is missing out on purchasing power procurement economy of scale.
All right. Now the consultants are on a roll.
They're focusing the Catholic Church on growth sectors saving money through centralization.
But in the big scheme of things this is pretty small potatoes low hanging fruit as they say in the consultant business.
The biggest business challenge to the Catholic Church is the erosion of the brand churches grow on trust.
And in the Catholic Church trust is in short supply these days.
The brand problems start at the smallest level of something really simple that happens in church.
The collection basket comes around parishioners feel moved feel responsible for the church and they put some money in the basket.
That basically makes them kind of like an investor in the church.
But Jim Poe says as investors they get almost no reporting back about how that money gets spent.
If they put their money into let's say a collection for a disaster relief program and then it's discovered that only five percent
of that money actually goes to disaster relief and the other 95 percent is used for other purposes siphoned off to other things.
Certainly the donors have a right to feel that they've been taken.
And without systematic accounting and disclosure there's enough doubt these days about how money is being managed that we don't know whether the hungry are being fed
and the naked are being clothed and the those in need are getting health care and education.
This is a common complaint among our consultants when they want to help the Catholic Church.
It's really hard for them and I mean these are people who actually talk with church leaders but it's still really hard for them to get the most basic information about revenues and expenses even at the local level.
A few diocese do put their budgets up online but most do not.
And where there is darkness there are people who will take advantage of this.
When financial controls are are not visible and they're not enforced you almost can guarantee that there will be that there will be misallocation of money and perhaps even worse than that.
There certainly are too many examples of of individuals some ordained some not who have walked off with money from various Catholic churches.
So how do we correct that.
You have to have a system of accountability and I think that involves transparent financial reporting back to the donor to the donor community.
Robert Zach who we heard from earlier with Villanova he and a fellow colleague have studied this issue.
They did a survey a couple of years ago where they talked to church leaders about their finances and they found about 85 percent of Roman Catholic diocese that responded to their survey had embezzlement problems.
More than 10 percent of them had had more than five hundred thousand dollars stolen in the last five years.
Now for most of the church's history people relied on faith faith in their church leaders to spend the money and like they said they were going to spend the money they didn't need detailed financial statements.
But you know as we mentioned at the beginning of the show recently there's been a lot of trust problems with the Catholic church and so this lack of transparency which is a problem in financial matters.
It becomes a much worse problem than embezzlement when you talk about some of the issues that have come up recently in the Catholic church.
I'm referring to the child sex abuse scandal which has devastated a lot of the Catholic church in America and it's really pushing people there to re-evaluate the whole transparency issue which is exactly what does the church tell its members about what it's doing and why it's doing it.
Father Tom Doyle gave us our Catholic history lesson.
He says transparency is a real issue.
He says he was in Boston while the clergy sex abuse scandal was going on and the church didn't do the best job of communicating what was happening in the church.
There was even problems in communication amongst the priests.
But Father Tom's also got a Harvard MBA and he spent a couple of years working for Deloitte and Touche the big consulting firm.
He says for a challenge this large the business advice is the same for the church as it would be for a corporation.
How do you get trust back?
You earn it.
You have to earn it right.
And so we're going to have to err on the side of being more transparent about things than we have in the past.
And so to sum up the advice our consultants have for the new pope as he comes in in the next few months.
Number one think globally allocate your resources properly.
Number two use your purchasing power act like one church if you're going to be one church.
And number three the transparency issue.
And this is where our consultants say believe it or not the Catholic Church can learn something from public corporations.
They have auditing processes.
They report back to their investors.
They have people come in and they lay open their books for the people who have given them money.
Now that doesn't mean corporations don't do something wrong but it doesn't mean we generally find out about it.
And then you know whoever the CEO is can make sure their heads roll.
Our corporations I say that openness something the Catholic Church should embrace.
