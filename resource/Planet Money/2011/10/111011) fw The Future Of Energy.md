On today's show, we talk to Daniel Yergin, one of the world's most influential thinkers about energy. We talk about the future of energy in America, and about Yergin's new book, The Quest. Yergin's previous book, The Prize, looked at the businessmen and politicians who fought to control oil around the world. The Quest looks beyond oil to alternative energy. The heroes are the engineers and scientists of the energy world — the geeks, in other words.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NATALIE EDOUARD: It's important to make note that we are not agreeing with the government, with this politic and the decisions it takes.

311: (Singing) Woah, amber is the color of your energy. Woah.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today is Tuesday, October 11. And that was Natalie Edouard (ph) you heard at the top. She and thousands of other French union workers are protesting government cost-cutting measures.

DAVIDSON: Today on the podcast, we take out our crystal ball. We peer into the next 20 years and try and figure out - can economics help us solve the problem of global warming? We have that conversation with what I think it's safe to say is the world's most influential thinker on energy issues, Daniel Yergin. But before all that, our PLANET MONEY indicator with our very own Jacob Goldstein. What do you got for us?

GOLDSTEIN: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 5.4 million. The population of Slovakia is 5.4 million.

DAVIDSON: Did someone buy you a book of facts, and you're just going to open it randomly?

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, this is a random PLANET MONEY indicator, but its very randomness is why it's such a big deal. Today, the fate of Europe's economy - dare I say it, the fate of the world hangs on those 5.4 million people. Slovakia's parliament is voting today on whether to expand Europe's bailout fund. And as of right now, every other country that uses the euro - that's more than 98 percent of the population of the eurozone - they have already approved this bailout fund expansion. But the way the euro works is every single country has to approve this before it can take effect. And so this fact - the fact that Europe and the world is all hanging on what Slovakia does, the fact that right now, just before we came in here, there's a link on the Wall Street Journal's home page saying that they are live blogging the parliamentary debate in Slovakia - this points to this huge, huge problem that really is at the root of a lot of the European debt crisis, which is there is not any real central authority to take the kind of big dramatic actions they need to end this crisis.

DAVIDSON: It is crazy. This must be the highest point of attention the Slovakian parliament has ever or will ever receive.

GOLDSTEIN: It's a big moment, Slovakia. Make that speech today, you know.

DAVIDSON: And we've already gone through this with Malta, Estonia...

GOLDSTEIN: Right, Malta was yesterday, yeah.

DAVIDSON: Such massive global powers - so this is like the entire U.S. economy revolves on what - what would be a comparable-sized state, like Wisconsin?

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, Wisconsin. And remember. Forty-nine other states in our imaginary world, they've already approved it. You know, it's not like it's, oh, it's 50-50, and Wisconsin is going to break the tie. It's like 98 percent of the population has already said, yes, let's do this. Oh, but wait. We've got to see if Wisconsin, you know, is going to jump in.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, and we in the U.S. have this amending the constitution process which was designed to be an incredibly difficult, high-bar - something we've only achieved a few dozen times in our entire history - and it's way easier than...

GOLDSTEIN: Much, much easier - and, you know, this is a huge problem for Europe right now because this debt crisis, which becomes a financial crisis, it moves very fast, right? So yeah, Slovakia will probably, today or this week approve this expansion to the bailout. But you know what? It clearly will not be enough. It won't be enough money. It won't be enough power. So we'll be on to the next thing where Europe is sort of behind the ball and waiting for Slovakia and Malta and Estonia and everybody else to approve it. I mean, the only way out of this, ultimately, is you break up the euro fund, or you create much more central authority. And either of those options would be incredibly painful and difficult, but there doesn't seem to be an alternative.

DAVIDSON: Wow. Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Sure.

DAVIDSON: All right, onto today's podcast. So Daniel Yergin is the dean of energy analysis, I think you can say - something pretentious like that. He's the head of the Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He's the voice on global energy policy - you know, the Saudis and Iran and, you know, the White House and everyone who cares about energy policy, Exxon Mobil - they're all waiting to hear what Daniel Yergin says. And most of his time is really micro details on the exact movement of energy around the world. But around once a decade, he redefines the fundamental way people look at energy.

In 1992, he won the Pulitzer Prize for his book "The Prize," which is the definitive history of oil. And it's about the big power battles that defined the 20th century - how big world leaders fought over oil. So his new book is called "The Quest." It's equally well-written, equally delightful, equally sweeping. And I've got to say. For PLANET MONEY people and I'm guessing a bunch of our listeners, it's probably more to our hearts because it's sort of the geeky companion to, you know, the macho world leaders of "The Prize." "The Quest" is about the nerds, the scientists, the inventors - the people who have been tinkering away for a very long time trying to come with alternatives to this dominant hydrocarbon-oil-based energy system. And Daniel Yergin and I started by talking about the race between gasoline and electric cars that started much, much earlier than I realized.

You showed me a great photo of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford sitting around a table literally deciding - should we - should cars be electric or should...

DANIEL YERGIN: See. At that time, Edison was the most famous American in the world. I mean, he was incredibly famous for what he had done - more famous than the presidents. And there was a dinner in 1896 in a restaurant in Long Island, and Edison was the guest of honor. And there was a young man there who was an engineer who worked for the Detroit Edison Company. And his name was Henry Ford. And he was trying to build this kind of contraption that - you know, a mechanical horse so to speak.

And Edison - they told - Edison couldn't hear very well, so they had Ford come and sort of almost shout into his ear. And he explained what he was trying to do. And Edison said, you know, you're right. That hydrocarbon - he called it - that's a good fuel. What he meant was gasoline. And Ford said that this was decisive for him in terms of his determination to, you know, finally leave his job and actually start making what became the Model T.

Edison then decided, a few years later, that actually cars with gasoline were too much trouble and really devoted himself to a battery for electric vehicles. In fact, there was electric vehicles called the Edison, but they never took off because by 1910 the race was over. Internal combustion engine - gasoline had won, and the electric car was off the track. Now, here we are, a century later, and the race that we thought was over has started again. And the electric car is out there as a potential competitor to oil-based transportation.

DAVIDSON: You showed me a picture of a car. It's not a Model T, but it looks like - I mean, it's from that era - where a woman is plugging it in.

YERGIN: Yes.

DAVIDSON: It seems so anachronistic.

YERGIN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: It seems like it would be from today.

YERGIN: Yeah, exactly, because right next to it is a photograph, in almost exactly the same posture, of this CEO of Nissan Renault plugging in a Leaf. And it's like - you know, it's like a time warp.

DAVIDSON: I mean, it's a lovely thought to think, like, what - this one conversation could have changed all of world history and eliminated global warming before it even began. But back then and today, there is something that gasoline has - its energy density - that's - it was probably going to win out over the battery - right? - no matter what Henry Ford and Thomas Edison decided.

YERGIN: Yeah, I think, at the time that the energy density - you didn't have to - the energy density was there already. The battery needed, you know, lots and lots of improvement. And it still needs lots of improvement to really get large-scale commercial adaption. And if Henry Ford - maybe somebody else would have figured out how to drive down the costs and move towards mass production.

DAVIDSON: What's a realistic thing to expect? So right now hydrocarbons are - is it 95 percent?

YERGIN: About 80 percent of our total energy.

DAVIDSON: Oh, that's it?

YERGIN: Yeah, but then there's nuclear and then there's renewables. Renewables - if you look at our energy in the late '70s and today, renewables are actually about the same percentage of our total energy.

DAVIDSON: Wow - as they were then? I mean, they've grown, but so has gas and oil.

YERGIN: Right.

DAVIDSON: So it's about 80 percent. And then how much is nuclear?

YERGIN: Well, nuclear in the United States is about 20 percent of our electricity. In Germany, it's 20 percent. In France, it's 80 percent.

DAVIDSON: And nuclear is really not a technological challenge. It's a political challenge fundamentally - or a safety challenge.

YERGIN: Yes. And, of course, nuclear - the plants that were built in the '60s are not the same plants that would be built today, you know. So there's still innovation. And a lot of the innovation is focused on safety so that you have so-called passive safety features. So what happened at Fukushima wouldn't happen in a new nuclear power plant.

DAVIDSON: Right. And that - I sort of want to table nuclear because nuclear could actually solve a lot of these problems but might raise other problems.

YERGIN: Right. It is - I mean, but it's interesting. After the nuclear accident at Fukushima in Japan, you saw different reactions by different governments. Chancellor Merkel, leader of Germany, said we're shutting it down by 2022. The French said, we're remaining committed to it. It was interesting. The Obama administration said that we continue to regard nuclear as an important component because it is currently the only large-scale, commercial, carbon-free source of electricity.

DAVIDSON: So of the other major renewables, which would be wind, solar, and biofuels - right? Those are the three major? - what's a realistic expectation? What's a reasonable range for how much they could grow in the next 20 years?

YERGIN: Wind could have - continue to have substantial growth particularly if it's demonstrated that offshore wind works in a large scale. The problem is not having the technology. The problem is having something that works at large scale and that's competitive. And I think the Europeans are now going to test that proposition in the years ahead because that's where they're making a very significant commitment. So we'll know in three or four or five years about that.

DAVIDSON: And what - could that go to 40 percent of U.S. electricity, or is that crazy?

YERGIN: Well, I think - I mean, there's an ambitious goal of getting to about 20 percent of our electricity from wind. Wind does have...

DAVIDSON: In 20 years or so?

YERGIN: ...Yeah. That's an ambitious goal. Wind does have a problem that it's intermittent. You can't - wind doesn't blow all the time, so you need something else. And for instance, natural gas is often sort of the partner of wind and solar. I think solar, you know, may be the ultimate destination of where we go. But it's still a question of bringing down the cost and making it competitive, again, on a large scale. Biofuels went through a big boom, you know, around 2006 - 2007. But I think what we've found - we're kind of - reached the limit for conventional ethanol in our motor fleet on an energy basis. It's about 6 percent, so it's a big number.

DAVIDSON: Right. And there's a big debate about at least some biofuels - certainly corn ethanol - that they might actually be net negative or net neutral.

YERGIN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: They might take as much energy to...

YERGIN: There's an incredibly vigorous argument about that. And what people are waiting for is the second-generation biofuels where you don't necessarily use food crops. You're not competing with what you're going to to do with corn and so forth. And, again, breakthroughs are possible. It may be tomorrow, or it may be down the road. But I think people have found that it is tougher than they thought.

DAVIDSON: Let's go back to solar. I remember 10 years ago - I think it was you, but I'm not sure - said once oil gets to $30 a barrel and stays above there, then solar is really competitive.

YERGIN: No, that was not me.

DAVIDSON: That wouldn't have been you? OK, all right (laughter).

YERGIN: Partly because solar and oil really don't compete with each other. Solar competes with coal and natural gas and wind because that's in the electric power sector, and oil is over here in the automobile sector.

DAVIDSON: Right.

YERGIN: So...

DAVIDSON: It doesn't make sense.

YERGIN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Right, right, right.

YERGIN: But I think it is true that high conventional energy prices are generally helpful to renewables because it makes people keener about them. Why did the first wave of renewables enter the valley of death? It's because oil prices in the 1980s - instead of going through the roof as was predicted - collapsed. And so it just didn't - you know, kind of said what's the point?

DAVIDSON: Right. Everyone thought they were going to be driving tiny little Japanese cars, and they all bought big SUVs because who cares?

YERGIN: That's - yeah. I have a great section of the book. I went back and said, you know, where did the SUV come from? And, you know, how it was invented? And it actually saved Chrysler. And it was - you know, they said Chrysler was the most profitable automobile company in the country.

DAVIDSON: Not permanently saved (laughter).

YERGIN: Yes, yes. Right.

DAVIDSON: But if we get a reasonably large hybrid or electric auto fleet, then the battle between oil and renewables is more direct - right? - because you are competing kilowatt hours versus dollar per barrel.

YERGIN: Well, that's right. That's right. If you get to the point where some significant part of our automobile fleet - and again we're - then we're talking significant part. We're talking 20, 30, or beyond because when we do our numbers, even the most optimistic case, it's hard to see more than 3 percent of the vehicles being electric by 2020. But let's say we get out there. Then you have a different competitive landscape. I think it also changes the psychology about oil because you have an alternative to oil in the transportation fleet.

DAVIDSON: And is 3 percent - I mean, I live in Brooklyn in Park Slope and I work in public radio. So as far as I'm concerned, all anyone wants is an electric car or a hybrid vehicle. So I'm surprised to hear the 3 percent number in 10 years.

YERGIN: Well, because it just takes time for the fleet. You know, only...

DAVIDSON: Right, the average age of a car is 10 years now.

YERGIN: Yeah, 7 or 8 percent of the fleet turns over every year - or maybe even less now.

DAVIDSON: So if everybody bought electric cars, you're talking about...

YERGIN: I'm saying this is how it looks today. Five years from now, it can look different. And we know that technologies can come and change. But it's just based upon what we know today and what we can see out there today and the lead time and the scale. So we could sell - you know, start selling a lot of electric cars. We're still in the sort of early stages, but it will take several years to start seeing their effect. By 2030, we could have a lot more electric cars.

DAVIDSON: So I want to stick with 20 years ahead, so - and I want to see if I'm following where we are. So it's 2030, let's say, and our economy and the world economy is twice as big as it is now. We're generally feeling more prosperous. We have whatever is 20 years cooler than the iPod and, you know, whatever...

YERGIN: Unemployment's down to 5 percent.

DAVIDSON: Let's hope.

YERGIN: Four and a half percent.

DAVIDSON: Right, having just got there the year before. And as a country we're producing - we're using about the same amount of energy because we've doubled our energy efficiency and...

YERGIN: That would be a huge achievement.

DAVIDSON: ...Which would be a huge achievement. Yes, I want to live in the ambitious, hopeful universe of 2030. OK, so now hydrocarbons are - in 2011, they're 80 percent. I mean, what would be an ambitious, hopeful goal. Would they be 70 percent, 60 percent?

YERGIN: I mean, in our kind of planning scenario, we use about 75 percent. And that seems to be - you know, you see those kind of numbers in other analyses. Some people have it much lower, and they have plans for making it much lower. It's just hard to see how you get there quickly and how you tell the Chinese that you want them to change their energy system quickly.

DAVIDSON: So 2030 - 75 percent, that sounds kind of depressing to me. I mean, that in 20 years a hopeful, ambitious is to just have 5 percentage points less of our energy comes from hydrocarbons.

YERGIN: Yeah, I mean, that, as I say, it's a kind of scenario based upon what we know today. What's always possible and I'm so aware of it in writing this book - that, of course, things can change - that, you know, there's a consensus, and everybody sort of sees things the same way. And then something happens that completely changes the picture. If there's a lot more progress in bringing down the costs of renewables, then their segment can be greater. And with greater efficiency, you know, the hydrocarbon share can be down.

DAVIDSON: So there's some brilliant 23-year-old in Cal Tech who could upend all of this.

YERGIN: Well, I think there is. And I think one of the things to me that's really hopeful is I see on all these campuses like MIT and others is that five years ago energy wasn't a topic. Now it's a very big topic, and it's really engaged the - both the commitment and the imagination of young scientists. And, you know, this book "The Quest" more than "The Prize" is a lot more about scientists, about people who - you know, and the power of scientific creativity. And so...

DAVIDSON: Right, "The Prize" was about - I don't want to say manly men. It was about world leaders and tough oil entrepreneurs.

YERGIN: Right, it was more of an adventure story, I guess. And this is one - it's a different kind of adventure.

DAVIDSON: A geekier adventure, which is what PLANET MONEY is all about - geeky adventures.

YERGIN: Yeah. And, you know, let's face it. You know, geeks are heroes today. You know, who's the big man on campus? It's the geek.

DAVIDSON: Right, right. And geeks will save us, right?

YERGIN: Yes, geeks will rule.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, we hope. All right, but still, an ambitious goal is 20 years from now - really, I've got to say - minor improvements in the...

YERGIN: I think what's - I mean, we have new entrants into the energy field, which are the venture capitalists. And they came in, you know, because they said, you know, look what we've done in information technology. Look what we've done in - you know, look at Google. Look at Facebook. Look at Apple. Look at Genentech - all these companies. We can do the same in energy. I think they have found so far that it's harder, that it's more capital intensive, that it takes longer. It's more complex. It involves more regulation, so it just doesn't happen as fast. So I think the seeds are all planted for change. And if we maintain a consistent pattern, we'll see it. Maybe it'll happen before 2030, but I think it's - you can be optimistic. But I think what we need is a marriage of optimism and realism.

DAVIDSON: Right. So there are people who, you know, want President Obama to have a, you know, man-to-the-moon kind of plan. You know, 10 - in 10 years, we will get you know, hydrocarbons down to 50 percent - that kind of thing. Is that - I mean, if we had a 1960s-style - just flooding the zone...

YERGIN: You know, we were - with the man in the moon or the Manhattan Project - you know, the Manhattan Project was trying to produce two bombs. That's what it was trying to do. The man on the moon was trying to get a couple of men on the moon. It wasn't trying to kind of change the foundations of the - of our - that underpin our economy. So I don't think a man-on-the-moon program or a Manhattan Project or Marshall Plan is quite the right way to go about it. What we need is constant, consistent spending on energy R & D as we need it in other parts of our economy. I headed a task force on energy R & D under the - in the Clinton administration days. And you just see this volatility of this spending, and that's very bad for young people who want to pursue careers answering questions. So I think we need a higher level and a consistent level. And I think that is probably among the most important things that the government can do and not try and, you know, to mobilize the whole economy. That would be a very tough order. And if you look at our politics today...

DAVIDSON: Oh, it's definitely not happening.

YERGIN: It's not going to happen. I mean, the whole issue now, I mean, in our country and other countries are going to be dominated about cutting budgets and fiscal solvency. So I would say what really needs to be preserved is this commitment to the future, which is what research and development is all about, and in the energy sector.

DAVIDSON: Can't we have a law that if you're really, really smart, you can't work on Wall Street? You move to the energy sector.

YERGIN: Right, bring all those physicists back.

DAVIDSON: That's right. Right. All right, so we talked a fair bit on the sort of game theoretic issues with global climate change that, you know, there's massive free-rider problems. You know, it's great for the U.S. if everyone else does, you know, climate change appropriate stuff, and then we just feel the benefits. Is there a path to sort of global coherence on energy policy? Or is it just China's self-interest and hopefully India's self-interest and maybe Brazil's will sort of drag the rest of the world?

YERGIN: I think there - you know, you can see the Chinese attitude - you know, one of the things I write about is around 2007, 2008 the Chinese started to have quite a different tone about climate change. And I was at a conference in June where I heard the president of China speak. And he said that there are, you know, three major issues facing the world. He says energy, food and climate change. And you wouldn't have heard a Chinese president say that five years ago, even the same Chinese president who's president now. So I think that's a change. And a lot of things that we do that we don't call climate change policies have that impact. Doubling the fuel efficiency of automobiles is - among other things, it's not only about efficiency and reducing imported oil and so forth. It's also in effect a de facto climate change policy. Renewable Portfolio Standards - de facto climate change policy.

DAVIDSON: Just last question - 2040, 2050, 2090? I mean, forecasts 20 years are tough enough. Forecast three months are tough enough.

YERGIN: Yeah, yeah.

DAVIDSON: You don't even go there?

YERGIN: Yeah, no. All I would say I think by 2040 or 2050, our energy system will probably look quite different than it does today, I mean, because then you'll have seen the impact of time. Twenty years ahead in energy, given the long lead times, is actually a pretty short period of time. The elements of change are there - indeed all these wonderful geeks who are really, you know, obsessed with energy. But it just takes time for the impact to be there. So what I hope with the book is that it is - as I say, it's both optimistic - it's about innovation and change - but at the same time realistic. And you can see how these pieces all fit together and make your own assessments about where you think the action and the change will come. But one thing we do know - the change will come.

**faster whisper:**
It's important to to make know that we are not agree with the government with this
politics and the decisions it takes.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today is Tuesday October 11th and that was Nathalie Edouard you heard at the
top. She and thousands of other French union workers are protesting government
cost-cutting measures. Today on the podcast we take out our crystal ball. We
peer into the next 20 years and try and figure out can economics help us solve the
problem of global warming. We have that conversation with what I think it's safe
to say is the world's most influential thinker on energy issues Daniel
Juergen. But before all that our Planet Money Indicator with our very
own Jacob Goldstein. What do you got for us?
Today's Planet Money Indicator 5.4 million. The population of Slovakia is
5.4 million. Did someone buy you a book of facts and you're just going to
open it randomly? This is a random Planet Money Indicator but its very
randomness is why it's such a big deal. Today the fate of Europe's economy
dare I say it the fate of the world hangs on those 5.4 million people.
Slovakia's parliament is voting today on whether to expand Europe's bailout
fund and as of right now every other country that uses the euro that
that's more than 98 percent of the population of the eurozone. They have
already approved this bailout fund expansion. But the way the euro works
is every single country has to approve this before it can take effect. And
so this fact the fact that Europe and the world is all hanging on what
Slovakia does the fact that right now just before we came in here
there's a link on the Wall Street Journal's home page saying that they
are live blogging the parliamentary debate in Slovakia. This points to
this huge huge problem that really is at the root of a lot of the European
debt crisis which is there is not any real central authority to take the
kind of big dramatic actions they need to end this crisis. It is crazy this
must be the highest point of attention the Slovakian parliament has
ever or will ever receive. It's a big moment Slovakia make that speech today. And we've
already gone through this with Malta, Estonia, such massive global powers. So
this is like the entire US economy revolves on what would be a
comparable size state like Wisconsin. Wisconsin and remember 49 other states
in our in our imaginary world they've already approved it. You know it's
not like it's oh it's 50-50 and Wisconsin's gonna break the tie. It's
like 98 percent of the population has already said yes let's do this. Oh
but wait we got to see if Wisconsin you know is gonna jump in. Yeah we in the US
have this amending the Constitution process which was designed to be an
incredibly difficult high bar something we've only achieved a few
dozen times in our entire history and it's way easier. Much easier and you
know this is a huge problem for Europe right now because this debt
crisis which becomes a financial crisis it moves very fast right so so yes
Slovakia will probably today or this week approve this expansion to the bail
out but you know what it clearly will not be enough. It won't be enough money
it won't be enough power so we'll be on to the next thing where Europe is
sort of behind the ball and waiting for Slovakia and Malta and Estonia
and everybody else to approve it. I mean the only way out of this
ultimately is you break up the euro fund or you create much more central
authority and either of those options would be incredibly painful and
difficult but there doesn't seem to be an alternative. Wow thank you
Jacob. Sure. All right on to today's podcast so Daniel Juergen is the Dean
of Energy Analysis I think you can say something portentous like that he is
the head of the Cambridge Energy Research Associates he's the voice on
global energy policy you know the the Saudis and Iran and you know the
White House and everyone who cares about energy policy Exxon Mobil they're
all waiting to hear what Daniel Juergen says and and most of his
time is really micro details on the exact movement of energy around the
world but around once a decade he redefines the fundamental way people
look at energy. In 1992 he won the Pulitzer Prize for his book The Prize
which is the definitive history of oil and it's about the big power
battles that defined the 20th century how big world leaders fought over oil.
So his new book is called The Quest it's equally well-written equally
delightful equally sweeping and I got to say for planet many people and I'm
guessing a bunch of our listeners it's probably more to our hearts because
it's sort of the geeky companion to you know the macho world leaders of
the prize. The Quest is about the nerds the scientists the inventors the
people have been tinkering away for a very long time trying to come up with
alternatives to this dominant hydrocarbon oil based energy system and
Daniel Juergen and I started by talking about the race between gasoline and
electric cars that started much much earlier than I realized. You showed me
a great photo of Thomas Edison and Henry Ford sitting around a table
literally deciding should cars be electric? See at that time and
Edison was the most famous American in the world I mean he was
incredibly famous for what he had done more famous than the
presidents and there was a dinner there in 1896 in a restaurant on the Long
Island and Edison was the guest of honor and there was a young man there
who was an engineer who worked for the Detroit Edison company and his name
was Henry Ford and he was trying to build this kind of contraption that
you know a mechanical horse so to speak and Edison they told Edison
couldn't hear very well so they had Ford come and sort of almost shout
into his ear and he explained what he was trying to do and Edison said you know
you're right that hydrocarbon he called it that's a good fuel what he
meant was gasoline and Ford said that this was decisive for him in
terms of his determination to you know finally leave his job and and
actually start making what became the Model T. Edison then decided a few years
later that actually cars with all gasoline were too much trouble and
really devoted himself to a battery for electric vehicles in fact there was
electric vehicles called the Edison but they never took off because by 1910 the
race was over internal combustion engine gasoline had won and the
electric car was off the track now here we are a century later and the
race that we thought was over has started again and the electric car is
out there as a potential competitor to oil-based transportation. I mean you
showed me a picture of a car it's not a Model T but it looks like I mean it's
from that era where a woman is plugging it in yes it it seems so
anachronistic it seems like it'd be from today. Yeah exactly because right
next to it is a photograph and almost exactly the same posture of this
CEO of Nissan Renault plugging in a leaf and it's like you know it's
like a time warp. I mean it's a lovely thought to think like what this
one conversation could have changed all of world history and eliminated global
warming before it even began but back then and today there's something that
gasoline has its energy density that's it was probably gonna win out over
the battery right no matter what Henry Ford and Thomas Edison decided. Yeah I
think at the time that the the energy density you didn't have to the
energy density was there to already the battery would need a you know lots
and lots of improvement and it still needs lots of improvement to really get
large-scale commercial adaption and if Henry Ford maybe somebody else would
have figured out how to drive down the costs and move towards mass
production. What's a realistic thing to expect? So right now hydrocarbons are
is it 95%? About 80% of our total energy. Oh that's it? Yeah but then
there's nuclear and then you know then there's renewables. Renewables if you
look at our energy in the late 70s and today renewables are actually about
the same percentage of our total energy. Wow as they were then I mean
they've grown but so has gas and oil. Right. So it's about 80% and then how
much is nuclear? Well nuclear in the United States is about 20% of our
electricity in Germany it's 20% in France it's 80%. And nuclear is really
not a technological challenge it's a political challenge fundamental or a
safety challenge. Yes and and of course nuclear the plants that were
built in the 60s are not the same plants that would be built today you
know so so there's still innovation and a lot of the innovation is focused
on safety so that you have so-called passive safety features so what
happened at Fukushima wouldn't happen in a new nuclear power plant. Right and
and and that I sort of want to table nuclear because nuclear could actually
solve a lot of these problems but might raise other problems. Right it is
I mean but it's interesting after the nuclear accident at Fukushima in
Japan you saw different reactions by different governments Chancellor Merkel
leader of Germany said we're shutting it down by 2022 the French
said we're being committed to it is interesting the Obama administration
said that we continue to regard nuclear as an important component because it is
currently the only large-scale commercial carbon-free source of
electricity. So of the other major renewables which would be wind solar
and biofuels right those are the three major what's a realistic
expectation what's a reasonable range for how much they could grow in the
next 20 years. Wind could have continue to have substantial growth particularly if
it's demonstrated that offshore wind works in in a large scale the problem
is not having a technology the problem is having something that works at
large scale and it's competitive and I think the Europeans are now going to
test that proposition in the in the in the years ahead because that's where
they're making a very significant commitment so we'll know in three or
four or five years about that. And what you know could that go to 40% of US
electricity or is that crazy? Well I think I think it I mean there's an
ambitious goal that of getting to about 20% of our electricity from wind
wind does have 20 years yeah that's an ambitious goal. Wind does have a
problem that it's intermittent you can't it the wind doesn't blow all the
time so you need something else and for instance natural gas is often sort
of the the partner of wind and solar I think solar you know may be the ultimate
destination of where we go but it's still a question of bringing down the
cost and making it competitive again on a large scale. Biofuels went through a
big boom you know around 2006 2007 but I think what we found but we're
kind of reached the limit for conventional ethanol in our motor
fleet on an energy basis it's about 6% so it's a big number. Right and
there's a big debate about at least some biofuels certainly corn ethanol
that they might actually be net negative or net neutral they might
take as much energy. It's an incredibly vigorous argument about
that and what people are waiting for is the second generation biofuels where
you don't necessarily use food crops you're not competing with what you're
going to do with corn and so forth and again breakthroughs are possible
maybe tomorrow or maybe down the road but I think people have found that it
is tougher than they thought. Let's go back to solar. I remember ten years ago
I think it was you but I'm not sure said once oil gets to $30 a barrel and
stays above there then solar is really competitive. No that was not me. That
wouldn't have been you? Okay all right. Partly because solar and oil
really don't compete with each other. Solar competes with coal and natural
gas and wind because that's in the electric power sector and oil is over
here in the automobile sector. Right it doesn't make sense right right right.
But I think it is true that high conventional energy prices are
generally helpful to renewables because it makes people keener about
them. Why did the first wave of renewables enter the valley of death? It's
because oil prices in the 1980s instead of going through the roof as
was predicted collapsed and so they just didn't you know kind of said what's
the point? Right everyone thought they were gonna be driving tiny little
Japanese cars and they all bought big SUVs because who cares. Yeah and I have
a great section in the book I went back and said you know where did the
SUV come from and you know how it was invented and it it actually saved
Chrysler and it was you know they said Chrysler was the most profitable
automobile company in the country. Not permanently saved. But if we get
a reasonably large hybrid or electric auto fleet then the battle between oil
and renewables is more direct right because you you are competing kilowatt
hours versus dollar per barrel. That's right if you get to the point where some
significant part of our automobile fleet and it and again we're where
then we're talking significant part we're talking 2030 or beyond because
when we do our numbers even the most optimistic case it's hard to see more
than three percent of the vehicles being electric by 2020 but let's say we
get out there then you have a different competitive landscape. I think it also
changes the psychology about oil because you have an alternative to oil
in the transportation fleet. And it's three percent I mean I live in
Brooklyn in Park Slope and I work in public radio so as far as I'm
concerned all anyone wants is an electric car or a hybrid vehicle so
I'm surprised to hear the three percent number even in ten years. Well
because it just takes time for the fleet you know only right the average age of a
car is ten years now. Seven or eight percent of the fleet turns over every year or maybe
even less now. So everybody bought electric cars you're still talking about something.
I'm saying this is how it looks today five years from now it it can look
different and we know that technologies can come and change but
it's just based upon what we know today and what we can see out there
today and the lead time and the scale. So we could sell you know start
selling a lot of electric cars. We're still in the sort of early stages but
it will take several years to start seeing their effect by 2030.
We could have a lot more electric cars. So I want to stick with 20 years
ahead. So and I want to see if I'm following where we are.
So it's it's 2030 let's say and our economy in the world economy is twice
as big as it is now. We're generally feeling more prosperous.
We have whatever is 20 years cooler than the iPod and you know whatever
unemployment's down to five percent. Let's hope. Yeah.
Having just got there the year before. And as a country we're producing we're
using about the same amount of energy because we've doubled our energy
efficiency and that would be a huge achievement which would be a huge
achievement. Yes. We're not. I want to live in the ambitious hopeful
universe of 2030. OK. So now hydrocarbons are there in 2011.
They're 80 percent. I mean what would be an ambitious hopeful goal.
Would they be 70 percent 60 percent. I mean in our kind of planning
scenario we use it's about 75 percent and that seems to be you know you
see those kind of numbers and other analyses. Some people have it
much lower and they have plans for making it much lower. It's just hard
to see how you get there quickly and how you tell the Chinese that you
want them to change their energy system quickly.
So 2030 75 percent that sounds kind of depressing to me. I mean that
in 20 years a hopeful ambitious is to just have five percentage
points less of our energy coming from hydrocarbons.
I mean that as I say it's a kind of scenario based upon what we know
today. What's always possible and I'm so aware of it in writing this
book that of course things can change that you know there's a consensus
and everybody sort of sees things the same way and then something
happens that completely changes the picture. If there's a lot more
progress in bringing down the cost of renewables then their segment
can be greater and with greater efficiency you know the hydrocarbon
share can can be down.
So there's some brilliant 23 year old in Caltech who could upend all of
this.
Well I think there there is and I think one of the things to me
that's really hopeful as I see on all these campuses like MIT and
others is that five years ago energy wasn't a topic. Now it's a very
big topic and it's really engaged the both the commitment and the
imagination of young scientists.
And you know this book the quest more than the prize is a lot more about
scientists about people who you know and the power of scientific
creativity.
And so the prize was about I want to say manly men it was about
world leaders and tough oil entrepreneurs and it was more of an
adventure story I guess.
And this is one it's a different kind of adventure but a geekier
adventure which is what planet money is all about.
Yeah. And you know let's face it you know geeks are heroes today.
You know who is the big man on campus.
It's the geek. Right. Right.
And geeks will save us right.
Geeks will rule.
Yeah we hope.
All right. But still an ambitious goal is 20 years from now.
Really I got to say minor improvements in the.
I think what's I mean we have new entrants into the energy field
which are the venture capitalists and they came in you know because they
said you know look what we've done information technology look what we've
done and you know look at Google look at Facebook look at Apple look at
Genetech all these companies we can do the same in energy.
I think they have found so far that it's harder that it's more
capital intensive that it takes longer it's more complex involves more
regulation.
So it just doesn't happen as fast.
So I think the seeds are all planted for change and if we maintain a
consistent pattern we'll see it maybe it'll happen before 2030.
But I think it's it's you can be optimistic but it's I think what we
need is a marriage of optimism and realism.
Right. So there are people who you know want want President Obama to
have a man to the moon kind of plan.
And you know 10 in 10 years we will get you know hydrocarbons down
to 50 percent that kind of thing.
It's that I mean if we had a 1960s style just flooding the zone.
You know we were we were with the man in the moon or the Manhattan
Project you know the Manhattan Project was trying to produce two
bombs.
That's what it was trying to do.
The man in the moon was trying to get a couple of men on the moon it
wasn't trying to kind of change the foundations of the of our that
underpin our economy.
So I don't think a man on the moon program or or Manhattan Project
or Marshall Plan is quite the right way to go about it.
What we need is constant consistent spending on energy R&D as we
needed in other parts of our economy.
I had a task force and energy R&D under the Clinton
administration days and you just see this volatility of this
spending and that's very bad for young people who want to pursue
careers answering questions.
So I think we need a higher level and a consistent level.
And I think that is probably among the most important things
that the government can do and not try and you know to mobilize
the whole economy.
That would be a very tough order.
If you look at our politics today.
Oh it's definitely not happening.
It's not going to happen.
I mean the whole issue now I mean in our country and other countries are
going to be dominated about cutting budgets and fiscal solvency.
So I would say what really needs to be preserved is this commitment to
the future which is what research and development is all about and in the
energy sector.
Can't we have a law that if you're really really smart you can't work on
Wall Street.
You move to the energy bring all those physicists back.
That's right.
Right.
All right.
So we've talked a fair bit on the sort of game theoretic issues with
global climate change that you know there's massive free rider problems.
You know it's it's great for the US if everyone else does you know does
climate change appropriate stuff and then we just feel the benefits.
Is there a path to sort of global coherence on on energy policy or is it
just China's self-interest and hopefully India's self-interest and
maybe Brazil's will sort of drag the rest of the world.
I think there you know you can see the Chinese attitude.
You know one of the things I write about is around 2007 2008 the Chinese
started to have a quite a different tone about climate change.
And I was at a conference in June where I heard the president trying to
speak and he said that there are three major issues facing the world this
is energy food and climate change.
And you wouldn't have heard a Chinese president say that five years ago even
this the same Chinese president who's president now.
So I think that's a change and a lot of things that we do that we don't call
climate change policies have that impact doubling the fuel efficiency of
automobiles is among other things it's not only about efficiency and
reducing imported oil and so forth.
It's also it's a it's a in effect a de facto climate change policy
renewable portfolio standards de facto climate change policy.
Just last question 20 40 20 50 20 90.
I mean forecasts 20 years are tough enough.
Forecast three months are tough enough.
Yes yes.
You don't even go there.
Yeah no all I would say I think by 20 40 or 20 50 our energy system
will probably look quite different than it does today because then you'll
have seen the impact of time 20 years ahead in energy given the long lead
times is actually a pretty short period of time.
The elements of change are there indeed all these wonderful geeks who are
really you know obsessed with energy but it just takes time for the
impact to be there.
So what I hope with the book is that it is as I say it's both
optimistic it's about innovation and change but at the same time
realistic and you can see how these pieces all fit together and make your
own assessments about where you think the the action and the change will come.
But one thing we do know the change will come.
