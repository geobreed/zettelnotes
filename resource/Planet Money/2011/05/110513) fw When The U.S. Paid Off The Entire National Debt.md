On today's Planet Money: The legend of the national debt. Where the debt came from, what happened the one time we paid it all off, and why Congress created the debt ceiling in the first place.

On Jan. 8, 1835, all the big political names in Washington gathered to celebrate what President Andrew Jackson had just accomplished. A senator rose to make the big announcement: "Gentlemen ... the national debt ... is PAID."

That was the one time in U.S. history when the country was debt free. It lasted exactly one year.

By 1837, the country would be in panic and headed into a massive depression. We'll get to that, but first let's figure out how Andrew Jackson did the impossible.

It helps to remember that debt was always a choice for America. After the revolution, the founding fathers debated whether or not to just wipe clean all those financial promises made during the war.

Deciding to default "would have ruined our credit and would have left the economy on a very agricultural, subsistence basis," says Robert E. Wright, a professor at Augustana College in South Dakota.

So the U.S. agreed early on to consolidate the debts of all the states — $75 million.

During the good times, the country tried to pay down the debt. Then there would be another war, and the debt would go up again. The politicians never liked the debt.

"What the battle was really about was how quickly to pay off the national debt, not whether to pay it off or not," Wright says.

But, just like today, it wasn't easy for politicians to slash spending — until Andrew Jackson came along.

"For Andrew Jackson, politics was very personal," says H.W. Brands, an Andrew Jackson biographer at the University of Texas. "He hated not just the federal debt. He hated debt at all."

Before he was president, Jackson was a land speculator in Tennessee. He learned to hate debt when a land deal went bad and left him with massive debt and some worthless paper notes.

So when Jackson ran for president, he knew his enemy: banks and the national debt. He called it the national curse. People ate it up.

In Jackson's mind, debt was "a moral failing," Brands says. "And the idea you could somehow acquire stuff through debt almost seemed like black magic."

So Jackson decided to pay off the debt.

To do that, he took advantage of a huge real-estate bubble that was raging in the Western U.S. The federal government owned a lot of Western land — and Jackson started selling it off.

He was also ruthless on the budget. He blocked every spending bill he could.

"He vetoed, for example, programs to build national highways," Brands says. "He considered these to be unconstitutional in the first place, but bad policy in the second place."

When Jackson took office, the national debt was about $58 million. Six years later, it was all gone. Paid off. And the government was actually running a surplus, taking in more money than it was spending.

That created a new problem: What to do with all that surplus money?

Jackson had already killed off the national bank (which he hated more than debt). So he couldn't put the money there. He decided to divide the money among the states.

But, according to economic historian John Steele Gordon, the party didn't last for long.

The state banks went a little crazy. They were printing massive amounts of money. The land bubble was out of control.

Andrew Jackson tried to slow everything down by requiring that all government land sales needed to be done with gold or silver. Bad idea.

"It was a huge crash, and the beginning of the longest depression in American history," Gordon says. "It actually lasted six years before the economy began to grow again."

During the depression, the government started borrowing money again.

No one says that paying off the debt caused the depression. The bubble was going to pop sometime. But the result was that we had to kiss a debt-free U.S. goodbye. The country never came close again.

RENEE MONTAGNE, host:

You know, politicians have been fighting over the U.S. debt since the United States was born. This country has always owed money to someone, except for one year: 1835, the only time in U.S. history the government has been completely debt-free.

Robert Smith from NPR's Planet Money team tells the story.

ROBRT SMITH: Let's start with the happiest day: January 8th, 1835. All the big political names in Washington, D.C. had gathered to celebrate the president, Andrew Jackson.

A senator stands up and he gives the news: Gentlemen, the national debt is paid. Historians tell us there was quite a huzzah.

Mr. JOHN STEELE GORDON (Author, "Hamilton's Blessing: the Extraordinary Life and Times of the National Debt"): It was a big deal.

SMITH: John Steele Gordon writes about financial history.

Mr. GORDON: This was another American accomplishment, that we had actually paid off our national debt. No other country had ever done that before.

SMITH: So Andrew Jackson gets rid of the debt. All of a sudden, the country's running a surplus. And we all live economically happily ever after, right?

Mr. GORDON: Not exactly.

SMITH: How long did the good times last?

Mr. GORDON: It lasted exactly one year.

SMITH: By 1837, the country would be in panic and headed into a massive depression - but we'll get to that.

First, let's figure out how Andrew Jackson did the impossible. It helps to remember that debt was always a choice for America. After the revolution, the founding fathers debated whether or not to just wipe clean all those financial promises made during the war.

Robert E. Wright, a professor at Augustana College in South Dakota, argues that they made the right choice by avoided default.

Professor ROBERT E. WRIGHT (Augustana College): It would have ruined our credit and would have left the economy on a very agricultural-subsistence basis.

SMITH: So the United States agreed early on to consolidate all the debts of all the states: $75 million. The U.S. would try to pay down the money it owed during the good times, then it would fight another war, and the debt would go up again. The politicians never liked it.

Mr. WRIGHT: So what the battle was really about was how quickly to pay off the debt, not whether to pay it off or not.

SMITH: But just like today, it wasn't easy for politicians to slash spending -until Andrew Jackson.

Professor H.W. BRANDS (University of Texas): For Andrew Jackson, politics was very personal. He hated not just the federal debt. He hated debt at all.

SMITH: H.W. Brands is a professor at the University of Texas. He tells the story of how Jackson, out in the Wild West of Tennessee, had been quite a land speculator, until a deal gone bad left him with massive debt and some worthless paper notes. So when Jackson ran for president, he knew his enemy: banks and the national debt. He called it the national curse. People ate it up.

Mr. BRANDS: Debt was considered a moral failing, and the idea that you could somehow acquire stuff through debt almost seemed like black magic.

SMITH: But Andrew Jackson had some magic of his own. There was a huge real estate bubble going on, and the U.S. had a lot of land in the wilderness. So they did a brisk business selling it off. Jackson was ruthless on the budget. He blocked every spending bill he could.

Mr. BRANDS: He vetoed, for example, programs to build national highways. He considered these to be unconstitutional in the first place, but bad policy in the second place.

SMITH: Jackson took office with around $58 million of national debt. Six years later, it was all gone, paid off. But Jackson now faced a problem that no other president has ever had: what to do with all that surplus money. Jackson had already killed off the National Bank, something he hated more than debt, so he couldn't put the money in there.

Mr. GORDON: And what he decided to do was to divide it among the states, according to the population. This is the only time that's happened.

SMITH: But John Steele Gordon says the party did not last very long. The state banks went a little crazy. They were printing massive amounts of money. The land bubble was out of control. Andrew Jackson tried to slow everything down by requiring that all land sales needed to be done with gold or silver. Bad idea.

Mr. GORDON: There was a huge crash and the beginning of the longest depression in American history. It actually lasted six years before the economy began to grow again.

SMITH: Now, no one's saying paying off the debt caused the depression. The bubble was going to pop sometime, and Andrew Jackson just wasn't savvy enough to do it gently. But the result was that we had to kiss a debt-free USA goodbye. The country never came close again.

**faster whisper:**
I clearly believe it's time to bend the cost curve and to get America headed toward a solid
fiscal foundation, which we do not see today.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Robert Smith. Today is Friday, May 13th. And that was House Speaker John
Boehner you heard at the top. On the podcast today, we are going to tell you a scary campfire story
about a monster that's been alive for more than 200 years that grew so large that it
threatens the very planet that we live on. It's the legend of the national debt.
Oh, I'm scared already. We're going to find out after the Planet Money Indicator from
Jacob Goldstein. Today's Planet Money Indicator,
3.2%. Prices for U.S. consumers rose by 3.2% over the past year. That's inflation,
obviously. Those numbers came out today. And that rise was largely driven, not surprisingly,
by the price of gas. Gas prices actually went up by 33% over the past year.
Yeah, we talked about how much gas has gone up, but it actually sort of amazes me with
that huge rise in gas prices that 3.2% inflation, that's pretty average. That feels pretty normal.
Yeah, it is pretty normal. It's right in the range where it's been for years, really.
Inflation has been creeping up a little bit lately, but there are some important
signs that it's not likely to get out of control anytime soon. You know,
we've talked about this before on the show. Gas prices and food prices, they tend to bounce
around a lot. They go way up. They come back down. So economists say, you know,
if you want to look at a more stable, less noisy kind of inflation, look at the price of everything
except food and energy. That's called core inflation. And core inflation over the past year,
it was at 1.3%, which is still pretty low. Oh, good news, finally, kind of.
Yeah, yeah, it's just fine. Just fine. I know normally there's a twist with you,
Jacob. Yeah, it's pretty straightforward, pretty straightforward indicator today.
Thanks, Jacob. Actually, I could use your help with one more thing. We're talking about
the U.S. debt today. So I need a bonus indicator. I love it. I love it. I love
one indicator. I love two even more. I need you to tell me what the debt is right this second.
Okay, so we got a computer in the studio. You're the debt guy. Should I look up one of
those debt clocks? Is there a good one you recommend? Yeah, the treasury updates it once
a day, but there's several sites that estimate it to the minute. So if I just Google debt
clock. Whoa, this is a crazy page. Okay, well, it keeps going up, but I'm going to say
14,374,004,598,600,000. Well, that's basically it. Thank you so much, Jacob. Sure.
Now, when I think about the debt, what I picture is just some massive, huge, inconceivably large
number. This big pit. This big pit of money just is lost. And, you know, I always feel
bad for folks in the media, including us, when you have to explain these huge, huge numbers.
Like I was seeing something on TV about it's like the num. If you piled the dollars up,
they'd go to the moon and then wrap around Saturn. Yeah, it goes back to
Uranus. And yeah, I don't know what they're talking about. It's really hard to understand.
What is this thing we're talking about when we're talking about the national debt?
Well, it's key to not think of it as one thing, because it's actually a bunch of
promises. It's millions and millions of specific promises that the government has made to specific
people. I mean, the government spends more than it takes in. That's called a deficit.
And the government borrows the difference from international financiers, people who
know the economy inside and out, people like this person.
My name is Elsie Smith, and I am seven and three quarters.
I happen to know Elsie Smith. She's a friend of mine. And in fact, she is your daughter,
Robert. Yeah, but that's not important right now. What she is is a creditor of the U.S.
government. Listen to what she discovered in my drawer. United States saving bonds,
$50. Why did you loan the government that money to keep it safe? Yeah, that's absolutely
right. You did loan it to them to keep it safe. And they used your money to buy things
like maybe a rivet on a fighter plane or something. That's a rivet. The little thing
that holds the plane together. I want my $50 back. Wow. Our international financiers are
so fickle. You know, it's funny, even at seven years old, she somehow, and I didn't tell her
this, she somehow managed to look at this thing, the savings bond, and understand what is most
fundamental about government debt. It's safe. It's completely safe. The U.S. has never gone
back on its promise. She could get that $50 tomorrow with interest back if I let her.
So to understand what the debt is, you've got to add up all the Elsies of the world,
all the retirement funds and central banks with lots and lots of treasury bills or savings
bonds in their drawers. And even if you don't have a bond in your drawer, you have effectively
lent the money to the government somewhere. Like maybe it's your checking account or your
savings account. That guaranteed interest that you get, that .3 percent these days,
it's probably backed by treasury bonds, by government debt. And we're always hearing
about how China holds over a trillion dollars of U.S. bonds, Japan, many,
many governments around the world. And when you add up all those promises, all those
different people and institutions that the U.S. government has said, hey, we're going to pay you
back. That is the national debt. Now, you've been hearing for months now all this talk about
the debt ceiling, the debt ceiling. It's like every day on the news. This one says we're not
going to raise the debt ceiling. That one says we have to raise the debt ceiling. That
is the limit that Congress put on the total amount of debt that the United States can have.
So today we're going to explain how we got into this mess, where all this debt came from,
what happened when we tried to pay it off, and who came up with this whole debt ceiling
idea in the first place. Now, it turns out we've been fighting about the debt
since the United States was born. OK, we're going to cue some old timey music here.
Good day and fare thee well, Brother Davidson.
Fare thee well, Elder Smith.
OK, we're back in revolutionary war days, as if you couldn't tell from that spot on
impression. This is when the first debate over the national debt started. And it's
important to remember that the U.S. debt wasn't something that just happened automatically.
In fact, the United States in its very first few days made a conscious decision
to have a debt, to issue these bonds, and promised to pay it back.
I spoke with Robert E. Wright. He's a professor of political economy at Augustana
College in South Dakota. What really happened is we fought a long and bloody revolution
against the world's greatest superpower and racked up $80 million in debt doing so.
Couldn't we have said, sorry folks, it's a revolution, we're wiping out all the debt?
We could have, but thankfully we didn't.
And we didn't because of a man named Alexander Hamilton. He was the Secretary of Treasury,
the very first one, and he argued that the United States faced a fundamental choice. If we
don't take responsibility for the debt, all those farmers that lent us money, and the soldiers we
didn't pay, and the French who lent us money, the rest of the world won't trust us. They won't
lend us money. We won't be able to trade. We'll be stuck. The United States will be stuck living
off whatever we grow here in our farms. And back then the U.S. didn't grow that much.
We brought much of our consumables from Europe. You know, the HBO series John Adams
did a great job of depicting Hamilton's argument.
The future prosperity of this nation rests chiefly in trade. Trade depends, among other
things, on the willingness of other nations to lend us money.
And how would you propose to establish international credit?
Our first step would be to incur a national debt. The greater the debt, the greater the
credit. And to that end, I have recommended to the President that Congress adopt all the
debts incurred by the individual states during the war through a national bank. The idea being
that if the states owe Congress money, then other nations will feel more inclined to lend
it to us. Now Hamilton, who was pro-debt, was fighting with Thomas Jefferson because Thomas
Jefferson had a very different view. He felt that debt was extremely dangerous. And
when you hear this speech that Jefferson gave, or at least the actor playing him in that HBO
series gave, it's a speech that I feel like with very little change could be given today.
If the states are indebted to a central authority, it increases the power of the
central government. Yeah, but exactly. I fear a revolution will have been in vain if a
Virginia farmer is to be held in hoc to a New York stock jobber who in turn is in hoc to a London
banker. The opportunities for avarice and corruption would certainly prove irresistible.
And this fight between Northeast bankers and the rest of the country, this has been going
on for 200 years. It's going on today. Now Hamilton won out initially. The United States
accepted its debt. It promised to pay. But Professor Robert Wright says that most politicians
at the time, they felt much more like Jefferson. Okay, fine, Hamilton, we'll pay off our old debt,
but let's not make a habit out of this. So what the battle was really about was how quickly
to pay off the debt, not whether to pay it off or not. And I have to give full disclosure
here. I spoke with Professor Wright and he told me that he gave his son a unique name. He named his
son Alexander Hamilton was right. Oh, come on. He really did. Really? He really did. And in
fact, his son came to him the other day. He told me and said, shouldn't it be Alexander
Hamilton is right? Right, because in his view, of course, Hamilton is right forever.
Wow. So for the first 40 years or so of the Republic, we lived in Hamilton's world.
The nation had a debt, a manageable debt. Banks and bankers in the northeast flourished. We did
trade with Europe and everybody trusted us. The country grew and pretty soon US debt, debt
issued by the US government was seen as one of the safest investments in the world. This was
Alexander Hamilton's dream until one president dared to pay it off. So cue our next chapter
in the amazing life story of the US debt, January 8th, 1835. Can we put on character again?
All right, picture it, Adam. All the big political names in Washington, D.C. have
gathered to celebrate the president, Andrew Jackson. It was the anniversary of his win
at the Battle of New Orleans, but there was bigger news that night. A senator stood up
and he raised his glass and he said, gentlemen, the national debt is paid. Huzzah!
Historians tell us the huzzahs rose up around the room. Finally, the national debt was zero.
It was a big deal. John Steele Gordon thinks so. He writes about financial history and he's
the author of the book, Hamilton's Blessing, the extraordinary life and times of the national
debt. This was another American accomplishment that we had actually paid off our national debt.
No other country had ever done that before. So when Andrew Jackson becomes president,
the debt had become sort of this routine thing and it actually followed the cycles that
business textbooks tell you a government debt should. During bad times, during wars like the
War of 1812 or during economic slowdowns, the country borrowed, basically borrowing against
their future prosperity. And then, sure enough, when the hard times were over and the economy
was doing well, the government would pay back the debt that it had borrowed, always maintaining
at least some level of debt. But Andrew Jackson did not like this normal routine picture.
For Andrew Jackson, politics was very personal. He hated not just the federal debt. He hated
debt at all. That's H. W. Brands. He's a professor at the University of Texas and he
wrote a biography of Andrew Jackson called His Life and Times. And he tells this great story
about Jackson. So before he was president, he was out in the wild west of Tennessee
and he was quite the land speculator. You know, he would often get paid in land and
he was trading all these things. And at one point he trades some land for some debt passed
on by somebody else. Well, this debt goes bad and Andrew Jackson is left holding the bag.
He's got this massive debt, worthless paper notes. And this drove him nuts. In fact,
the guy he did the deal with, it went to jail. So when Jackson runs for president,
he knows the enemy, banks and the national debt. He called it the national curse.
And the voters just ate this up. Andrew Jackson had an actual plan to get rid of the debt,
but he also got very lucky. When he took office, there's around $58 million of debt that the U.S.
government owed. And one way that he paid it off, there happened to be a huge real estate
bubble going on. And rather than bail out the banks, it turned out that at the time,
the U.S. owned a lot of land in the wilderness. They sold it at these inflated
bubble prices, which brought in a lot of money, which went to paying off the debt.
And Jackson was, I'll give him credit, ruthless on the budget. I mean, he blocked
every spending bill he could, highways, government buildings. It was veto, veto, veto.
So after six years in office, he paid it all off. It was all gone. But Jackson suddenly
faced this technical problem that no other president has ever faced either before or since.
What do you do when the government has more money than it needs? What do you do with
the surplus? Now, back then, there was no income tax. You couldn't just give everybody
a refund. There wasn't really a way to return money to the people.
And what he decided to do was to divide it among the states according to population.
This is the only time that's happened. So Andrew Jackson gets rid of the debt.
All of a sudden, the country's running a surplus and we all live economically,
happily ever after, right? Not exactly.
How long did the good times last? It lasts exactly one year.
One beautiful year. The state banks apparently went a little crazy with the surplus. They
were printing massive amounts of paper money and that land bubble. I mean,
the one that helped Jackson balance the budget, get rid of the debt.
The land bubble went out of control. And then like all bubbles, it popped.
There was a huge crash and the beginning of the longest depression in American history.
It actually lasted six years before the economy began to grow again.
Now, we're not saying every time you pay off the debt, you're instantly going to cause
a massive depression, but there was a clear lesson here. No matter how much you hate the debt,
eliminating it does not guarantee that you're going to have good times.
Even in the early 1800s, the economy was far too complex for that.
And it turns out that having the debt come back was pretty useful for the United States.
There was a civil war to pay for and a bunch of other economic downturns.
The 1900s were full of them and it looked like there was no end to the amount of debt
the country could take on. Until we get to the final
chapter in our story, chapter three, politicians could not kill the debt monster.
But they decided, well, maybe we can tame it a little.
You see, debt in the United States was not just getting bigger. It was getting more complex.
Up until World War I, Congress had to approve every little bit of borrowing.
Susan Irving is with the Government Accountability Office.
I mean, you know, I want to borrow money to build X.
And so Treasury would go to Congress and they would literally approve
the form of the security, the purpose of the security,
you know, what the duration was going to be, what the interest rate was going to be.
So this could take all day long. You could say bridges, post offices,
a canal through Panama.
Right. Well, if you look at the early appropriations acts,
they're completely earmarked. I mean, you look at early appropriations acts,
so much for shooing the horses for the Department of X. I mean, really.
Very detailed control.
It is so hard to imagine just Congress who are not finance professionals sitting there
and every single thing the government wants to buy.
They have to decide how much debt to issue, what the interest rate would be.
Will it be a five-year bond at 3.8 percent or a 10-year bond at 4.2 percent?
It's so hard to imagine.
And what's actually shocking is that for over a century, they were able to do this.
They were able to keep it together.
But by World War I, it was just too much stuff.
It was too complicated.
If you think about the number of decisions that go on during a war,
you know, suddenly if they're going to have to approve every single one,
you're coming in not once a year, not once every two years.
You're coming in sort of constantly.
Oh, now we need to borrow up to so much to build up more tanks.
You know, and you think, really?
At some point, the sheer volume of transactions overwhelms
and begins to drive out the ability to do thoughtful discussions about big policy.
And Congress loves to do thoughtful discussions of big policy.
So they delegated.
They delegated the authority.
They told the Treasury Department in 1917 and in various acts after that
that, you know, why don't you all figure out how much borrowing we need
and how you're going to do it?
But Congress doesn't just give the executive branch lots and lots of power.
They do not.
No. So they say, okay, we're going to give you this job of figuring out what bonds
and what duration and what interest rate and all that stuff.
But we're not letting you go nuts.
We're going to have a ceiling.
You can only borrow up to this amount, an upper limit.
And if you need to do more, if you need to borrow more money,
come back and see us and we'll decide whether or not to raise the debt ceiling.
But there's something crucial to understand here.
Nothing gets bought by the federal government unless Congress says so.
I mean, it's in the Constitution.
The power of the purse rests with Congress.
So the debt limit doesn't actually limit the spending.
That would be unconstitutional to limit the spending.
It's a safety check.
You know, I think of it as this big game of mother, may I?
You know, that old kids game.
Congress says to the Treasury Department, we want to buy a tank.
And Treasury looks at it and it brings up the debt limit.
And the Treasury Department has to come back to Congress and say,
mother, may I buy a tank and raise the debt limit?
And Congress votes and says, yes, you may.
But what's so ridiculous is all the Treasury is asking approval to do
is spend the money that Congress has told them to spend.
In other words, Congress says, go spend this money,
and then acts all huffy that spending the money Congress approved
is going to get us over the debt ceiling.
It's so maddening.
And it's something that pretty much no other country goes through.
They don't go through this whole rigamarole.
They simply approve spending.
And by implication, the borrowing is just implicitly approved as well.
But in part, that's because there isn't this separation
between the executive branch, like the Treasury Department,
and the legislative branch, like the Congress.
So the debt ceiling turns out to be not so much something to slow the debt,
but it's a sign of good old American distrust.
It's a way for one branch to basically give the hard work to somebody else,
but say, I don't really trust you.
So in a sense, the debt ceiling was a success.
Congress did not have to spend all of its time worrying about bond issues
and durations and interest rates.
And actually, the Treasury used this new freedom
to come up with the sort of economy we see today,
all these efficient forms of issuing various lengths of debt
and using the market to determine the interest rate that's paid on the bonds.
All these things basically make it easier for the government
and cheaper for the government to get money.
But the debt ceiling did not do its fundamental mission.
It did not in any way contain the growth in our national debt.
Every year, sometimes more than once a year,
the Treasury Department has come to Congress and said,
Mother, may I increase the debt ceiling
so that I can borrow the money to buy the things
that you already told me to buy?
And Congress would say,
Yes, you may.
And then the debt goes up during the Depression, during World War II.
And then starting about 50 years ago, the debt explodes.
And what happened is it no longer went through a cycle.
The debt goes up during bad times and goes down as paid off during good times,
just administration after administration,
Democrat after Republican after Democrat after Republican.
The debt just goes bigger and bigger during good times and bad.
When the economy is growing fast, the debt is growing faster than the economy is.
And each time the debt ceiling got raised.
Which brings us to this year.
Right now, Republicans are using the debt limit
as a way to force a showdown on the size of government.
They're sort of playing chicken with our national economy.
They're saying we are not going to increase the debt ceiling this time
unless we get a significant promise to cut spending in the future.
And it is getting close.
If you remember that number that Jacob just gave earlier in the podcast,
we are right at the debt ceiling.
We were supposed to pass the debt ceiling this weekend.
But the government's shuffling all its money around
so it can hold out why Congress plays this game of chicken.
Because the secret is that,
look, we know that they're going to pass the debt ceiling.
They pretty much have to.
Anyone with any amount of economic knowledge or sense of history
knows that the U.S. government cannot possibly default on its debt.
Congress is the one who authorized this spending
that they're saying they don't want to increase the debt ceiling to pay for.
And no one can seriously argue that the United States
is not going to pay its bills when they come due.
Even a child knows she's going to get her $50 back with interest.
I'll tell Elsie that. She's going to be very happy.
Because, you know, forget about the world economy.
If a seven-year-old learns that they can't trust the government
with their money, it's all over.
I mean, she already doesn't trust her dad.
Do you think you get to spend this $50?
No.
Why not?
I don't think you would just give that money for me to spend if it was that much money.
That's your college fund, baby.
And by the way, in the 20 minutes or so we've been talking,
the debt ceiling has gone up by, wow, $56,999,729.
Oh, and 33 cents.
And counting.
As always, we would really like to hear what you think of today's podcast.

I'm an angel, angel, angel, angel, angel, angel.
