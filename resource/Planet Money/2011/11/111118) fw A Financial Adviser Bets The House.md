Financial planner Carl Richards tells us how he got sucked into the financial mess just like the rest of us and shares what it taught him.

On today's show, we talk to Carl Richards. His job is to give people financial advice, yet he got sucked into the housing boom and spit out the other end, just like millions of other people.

He tells us his story, and explains how his experience has changed the way he thinks about money, and about risk.

PATRICK NEWPORT: Single-family housing starts, single-family permits, new home sales are all going to set record lows this year. We're at the bottom right now, and so anything - really, we only have - the only place we have to look is up.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHAKE IT OUT")

FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE: (Singing) There's always darkness before the dawn. Shake it out, shake it out. Shake it out, shake it out. Whoa. Shake it out, shake it out. Shake it out, shake it out. Whoa. And it's hard to dance...

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today's Friday, Nov. 18. And that was Patrick Newport - a housing analyst with IHS Global Insight - that you heard at the top.

KESTENBAUM: Doing his best Jacob Goldstein. But you got the real Jacob Goldstein here. On the show today - true confessions of a financial adviser.

GOLDSTEIN: A financial adviser who tells us how he got sucked into the boom and bust just like the rest of us. And he tells us what he learned from it. But first, Kestenbaum.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah?

GOLDSTEIN: I'm going to give you the indicator.

KESTENBAUM: Oh, yeah. Good.

GOLDSTEIN: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 29. Twenty-nine percent of people with mortgages are underwater. This is according to the website Zillow. In other words, all these people, they owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.

KESTENBAUM: Put another way, these people, if they wanted to leave their house - get out of it - they would have to write a check to leave. Selling the house would not cover what they owe on it.

GOLDSTEIN: This, of course, is a huge problem for lots of reasons. People who are underwater are much more likely to go into foreclosure. It also makes it harder for people to move, say, to find work. And this is still years into the housing bust - a big, big problem.

KESTENBAUM: We're going to take today to talk to one guy who was underwater and who, in a lot of ways, embodied the housing crisis. He rode the bubble up, and then he rode it down.

GOLDSTEIN: A lot of people bought more house than it turned out they could afford, but this particular guy, he was highly trained as a financial adviser. His name's Carl Richards. Sometimes he writes about financial stuff for The New York Times.

KESTENBAUM: Carl - he just recently went public with his own personal misfortunes. We brought him in to tell his story and how it changed him. Before we get to that, though, he told us this kind of funny story about how he got into the financial business.

CARL RICHARDS: Yeah. It was June (laughter) - June of '95. A couple weeks after we got married, I came home. I was digging - I was working for a landscape company. I was the low man on the totem pole, so I was literally digging ditches at that point.

And my wife was like, look, I don't think that's a long-term career. And it's, you know, it's just a job to work my way through school. She said she started looking for other jobs. These were just, you know, like, part-time jobs. I was taking a full load at school.

And so we looked through the want ads, and she found an ad - and I wish I'd kept it - but we were under the impression it was a security job, you know, some sort of security thing.

KESTENBAUM: Security, like a - like a rent-a-cop kind of thing?

RICHARDS: Yeah, like bouncer, you know, and I've always fancied myself as a big, strong guy, so I thought that'd be great. I went in to the temporary agency - I think it was Volt - applied for this job and found out that it was a securities job. And it was at a large - one of the big - it's actually Fidelity. It has a huge call center here in Salt Lake. And they narrowed it down to two of us. And they came out - and the interview person came out and said, you know, we can only hire one of you. And, you know, Carl, sorry. We've offered the job to this guy. And the guy turned to me and said, you know, I don't want it. You can have it.

(LAUGHTER)

RICHARDS: So that's how...

KESTENBAUM: Bound for greatness.

RICHARDS: Yeah. It's pretty - like, people have made a big deal of, like, oh, how could he be - but that was 15 years ago - right? - working my way through school, part-time job.

KESTENBAUM: So basically, people would - people who - if you have, like, a Fidelity brokerage account or retirement account and you want - have some basic question to ask, and you call the 800 number, you answer.

RICHARDS: Yeah. And remember, like, I have to keep reminding people, you know, this was '95. So remember, like, Google Finance didn't exist. So like, I would literally get, you know - the same guy would call every day at 5 and ask for 15 quotes.

KESTENBAUM: He just wanted to know, like, how did the stock in Pfizer do today? Or how did stock...

RICHARDS: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: ...In Microsoft do today?

RICHARDS: Am I up or am I down?

KESTENBAUM: Am I up or down?

RICHARDS: To know to a large degree, yeah. I was answering those calls. I got thrown on the tax gate, which was pretty funny. Every single phone call, you know, is, you know, somebody asking me about some tax implication of something I've never heard of. Every single phone call is like, please hold. I'd have to go research, come back with the answer. So that was it. That was the deal.

KESTENBAUM: Carl worked his way up. He got more training. He stopped having to put everyone on hold. And by 2003, he had his own clients. He was working for Merrill Lynch.

GOLDSTEIN: He had three kids by this time - he had a fourth on the way. And he got an offer to go work for Merrill Lynch in Las Vegas.

KESTENBAUM: Vegas, baby, Vegas.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. It really was at the time. You know, it was the heart of the boom. And he took the job and moved there. And he told us what it looked like when he got there.

RICHARDS: We lived in this area of town sort of west of the strip, up against the mountains, out near Red Rocks National Conservation Area. And the - I mean, you could almost see the city - well, you could. You could literally see the city expanding into the desert, you know, like boom, boom, boom, these new sort of rows of subdivisions.

And you'd go to these - even when we were coming down to kind of visit to make this decision, we started going to a couple of these open houses of these new communities open up, and there would be lines of people. And, you know, these would be $300,000 $400,000 $500,000 $600,000 houses, and there would be lines of people younger than, you know, younger than we were. And every new phase, the price would go up.

And so that's kind of the feeling you got of, like, wow, you know, these hot prices are increasing so fast. We may not be able to buy a house if we don't now. It was just like this train was leaving, and if you weren't on it, you were never going to get on.

GOLDSTEIN: How much money were you making at the time? And how much were you looking to spend?

RICHARDS: I know my income was getting closer to six figures. It seems to me we started looking at, like, $350,000. And that sort of made sense to me for some reason. It's not like I went through some big calculation. It's just, it made sense to me. We'd run the quick payment. We'd say, well, we can afford that. So that's where we started - was $350,000.

And we quickly, you know, quickly things spike - like, well, if you just - can, you know, just spend $50,000 more, you get this. And you just spend $100,000 more, you get this. So we ended up buying a house for $575,000 for sale by owner.

And you've got to remember, too, these - this is almost painful for me to recount because in hindsight, these things are all blazingly obvious. I mean, we made - and the reason I - frankly, the reason I told this story is we made - and hopefully it came across in the way I wrote it was - these are my mistakes, right? We made mistakes, and they look blazingly obvious in looking back.

But at the time, you - it made sense. And everywhere you looked, you were reinforced with the idea. And it was talked about openly that you buy as much house as you possibly can because the thing is just going up in value, right?

There was this interesting shift - and I was uncomfortable with it, did it anyway - this interesting shift of this isn't necessarily, you know - it's silly to view this as just a home, right? This is also one of the best opportunities to increase your net worth you could ever have - right? - because these things are growing. It's tax free, right? You sell it two years later, you don't have to pay taxes. You can move it into a new house.

You know, housing prices were going up, my income was going up, like, everything was going the right way, which leads you to sort of another classic mistake, which is sort of projecting the recent past into the future infinitely, right?

KESTENBAUM: What was that house like?

RICHARDS: Single story, 3,400 square feet - smallest model in the neighborhood, pretty unique neighborhood in Las Vegas. It was on, like, sort of multiple subdivisions all behind one big, you know - everything in Vegas is sort of fenced off - right? - like, gated communities everywhere. And this was, like, four communities behind one big gate.

So there was lots of people surrounded by a central park. The park - the green space, we called it, went under most of the roads to get to the kids' school - the elementary school. So it was really, really cool, really fun place for the kids.

KESTENBAUM: So they could walk to school, like, underneath the roads on these green pathways or something?

RICHARDS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And along the paths, there were, like, the tortoise and the hare statues - like, it was almost a little surreal, frankly, looking back on it. The tortoise and the hare - big, you know, big tortoise, a big hare, you know, like as they walked to their public elementary school, which was, luckily, one of the better schools in the county for sure.

KESTENBAUM: Things are going really well - so well that Carl decides he's going to leave Merrill Lynch, and he's going to do that thing that makes the economy grow. He's going to start his own company.

GOLDSTEIN: And, of course, he needs some money to do that. And remember, we're still in the boom here, so his house - it's already increased in value. So get that money. He does what everybody else does. He takes out a second loan on his house.

KESTENBAUM: A second loan. And for a while, things are going well. Kids got a great school to go to, he's getting new clients. He can make his payments. And then, things are not going so well.

RICHARDS: The market starts to turn pretty abruptly. I know it's so - it's so easy, and I get so frustrated. Like, so easy to look back, we should have known. Yeah, I know we all should have known. But the realities go back - I mean, there weren't a lot of people sounding alarm bells, right? I mean, I know there were some. I know there were some, but most of us were convinced - nobody really wanted to be the person at the party that said, hey, this thing's about to end. So all right, income's going up. Suddenly, things start to slow, and they slow pretty rapidly, right? Remember late - late '08? You know, the whole sort of Lehman AIG thing starts to unravel.

And then, just - and I mean, seriously, at this point, I had a sense that things were bad, right? Like - and I remember being on bike rides with friends that were smart real estate folks and real estate agents who - and one particularly, who was a real estate agent but one of the, you know, one of the relatively rare real estate agents that really cared about the value of the investment he was helping his client make rather than just the commission. And he said to me, you know, we were both talking, like, well, this will come back. And I remember both looking at each other and going, what if it doesn't?

What if it doesn't? And that was the first time where I was like, wow, what if it doesn't? And then, two, there was still this sense of, like, well, we live in, you know, one of the most desirable neighborhoods. It's a nice neighborhood.

KESTENBAUM: We got the tortoise and the hare.

(LAUGHTER)

RICHARDS: Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: Turns out everybody in your neighborhood was the hare.

RICHARDS: (Laughter) Of course, we have the tortoise and the - you're always trying to paint this like, we'll be immune.

GOLDSTEIN: So the way Carl's business works, he gets paid based on how much money his clients have invested. So when the whole stock market goes down, by and large, Carl's income goes down.

KESTENBAUM: His family tries to cut back on everything they can cut back on. They cut back on trips. They went from two cars down to one car, with four kids. But it was not enough. They still have too much house.

And finally, a friend advised him to do something he'd been avoiding, really trying not to do at all costs. His friend says to him, you've got to just stop paying your mortgage.

RICHARDS: And I remember being sort of like, are you - really? Like that's - and at the same time, like, relieved that maybe - wait a second - maybe there's a way this could work. This wasn't a strategic decision. At this point, it was, like, we - well, it's hard to say we had no choice because I guess we could've figured out how to borrow money from somebody else. I don't know. At this point, it felt like the only choice.

I called the bank. You're current, we can't work with you. I say to the bank, and they literally said to me, look, the department that works with people is in - sort of think of it as another building. Your file will not move over to that building if you're current. Like, there's nobody to talk to.

So we stopped, you know, and that was - that was painful. You know, I'm just terrified of my kids opening the, you know, the mail and - or answering the phone and it's one of those collection mortgage police, you know, whoever those people are.

I just remember thinking how,- you know, how are we ever going to get out of this? And we work through, initially, a modification process with the bank. The modification offer wasn't going to work. There's no way. Plus, we needed to move. So in the middle of that, we were trying every angle. Could we stay here? Could we rent the house? Slowly, we run out of bullets - if you will - and all that's left is, look, will you work with us on a short sale?

GOLDSTEIN: You sold the house for - what? - hundreds of thousands of dollars less than you owed the bank.

RICHARDS: Yup. And hundreds being, like, between two and three.

GOLDSTEIN: And did that screw up your credit? I mean, is that a kind of default?

RICHARDS: Yes. It shows up as a settled for less than the amount owed.

KESTENBAUM: So I feel like there are a lot of people in America right now who are in a situation not so different from yours. How are you doing now years after this? Are you still - you're still digging out.

RICHARDS: Yeah, I mean it's 16 - what is it? - 16 months. You know, it was June of 2010. So yeah, we're still digging out. I mean, my business is good. We qualified for a - to get a modest car loan and still digging out. I mean, we're getting close but still digging out - couldn't buy a house right now if we wanted to.

KESTENBAUM: So you're a parent of four, right?

RICHARDS: Correct.

KESTENBAUM: I feel like, as a parent, you're always trying to pass on your, like, life lessons. Like, I just learned this. Like, here, you got to know this. What do you - what have you - how do you explain this whole thing to them? What do you tell them?

RICHARDS: One thing I've decided - I don't know if I'm right about this or not, but it feels right to me - for us - is our daughters that are 12, 14 and 12 - almost 13 now - and our 10-year-old son is - you know, maybe another year or two, we're going to involve them much more in the family financial decisions. We're going to have them understand these tradeoffs and, you know, why maybe we don't want to go on that vacation so we can fund that college account.

Or, I mean, really, I've decided - I may be wrong. My kids knew that was going on. The kids know. And my thought is, look, I don't know that you can be too open. So that's the lesson I want to pass on to them is we're just going to walk through the family finances, help them contribute to the family finance discussion and decide that may - there may not be anything we should hide.

I mean, so - and again, I don't know where that line is. Maybe there are some things that they don't need to know, but that's what we're going to talk to them about.

GOLDSTEIN: So his kids are one thing, David, but, you know, Carl is a financial adviser. So, of course, we asked him, what does this whole thing - this whole experience - say about the basic nature of his profession, the basic idea of getting paid to give financial advice? Because clearly, you know, he was as surprised by what happened as everybody else.

KESTENBAUM: He said, quite candidly, yeah, this episode, it did change things for him. He says actually a lot of what he's learned in general is from making mistakes - the same mistakes that he now goes around trying to help other people avoid.

RICHARDS: One of the things I've found myself doing much more recently is that I used to spend a lot of time focused on the probability of a certain event happening. So if you think about maybe failure - right? - the probability of this not working. And, you know, maybe it's 5 percent - or you set this sort of Robert Rubin sort of idea. Like, you said the probability is 5 percent.

Now, instead of just focusing on the probability of an event, I find myself focusing on the consequence. And so, all right, if it's a 5 percent chance but if it happens you die, I'm not - I'm no longer saying, well, it's only five - I'm now saying, but I would die.

And I think that is the approach - I know that's changed in the advice I give, and I know it's something that's changed in the way we are handling things now. And I hope that continues for a long time. I mean, I hope this is - and I've said this generally. I hope this lesson seared and sort of burned into all of us - that there's nothing wrong with taking a risk, but let's understand the implications of those decisions and the impact - not just the probability.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHAKE IT OUT")

FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE: (Singing) It's always darkest before the dawn. And I've been a fool, and I've been blind. I can never leave the past behind. I can see no way, I can see no way.

GOLDSTEIN: We will link to Carl's New York Times story on our blog at npr.org/money.

KESTENBAUM: Also, check out our colleague, Adam Davidson's, column that's going to run this Sunday in The New York Times Sunday magazine. It's about this weird habit we have in America where we live pretty frugally for 11 months, and then we spend, spend, spend for this other month. It's always December for some reason.

GOLDSTEIN: If you know why that may be, you can email us at planetmoney@npr.org. You can also find us on Facebook or Twitter. I'm Jacob Goldstein.

KESTENBAUM: I'm David Kestenbaum. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "SHAKE IT OUT")

FLORENCE AND THE MACHINE: (Singing) And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back, so shake him off. Whoa. And I am done with my graceless heart, so tonight I'm going to cut it out and then restart 'cause I like to keep my issues...

**faster whisper:**
Single-family housing starts, single-family permits, new home sales are all going to set
record lows this year.
We're at the bottom right now and so anything, really we only have, the only place we have
to look is up.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today is Friday, November 18th, and that was Patrick Newport, a housing analyst with
IHS Global Insight that you heard at the top.
Doing his best, Jacob Goldstein, but you got the real Jacob Goldstein here.
On the show today, true confessions of a financial advisor.
A financial advisor who tells us how he got sucked into the boom and bust just like the
rest of us, and he tells us what he learned from it.
But first, Kestenbaum.
Yeah?
I'm going to give you the indicator.
Oh yeah, good.
Today's Planet Money indicator, 29, 29% of people with mortgages are underwater.
This is according to the website Zillow.
In other words, all these people, they owe more on their mortgage than their
home is worth.
But another way these people, if they wanted to leave their house, get out of it, they
would have to write a check to leave.
Selling the house would not cover what they owe on it.
This of course is a huge problem for lots of reasons.
People who are underwater are much more likely to go into foreclosure.
It also makes it harder for people to move, say to find work.
And this is still years into the housing bust, a big, big problem.
We're going to take today to talk to one guy who was underwater and who in a lot
of ways embodied the housing crisis.
He rode the bubble up, and then he rode it down.
A lot of people bought more house than it turned out they could afford.
But this particular guy, he was highly trained as a financial advisor.
His name's Carl Richards.
Sometimes he writes about financial stuff for the New York Times.
Carl, he just recently went public with his own personal misfortunes.
We brought him in to tell his story and how it changed him.
Before we get to that though, he told us this kind of funny story about how
he got into the financial business.
Yeah, it was June, June of 95.
A couple weeks after we got married, I came home.
I was digging, I was working for a landscape company.
I was the low man on the totem pole.
So I was literally digging ditches at that point.
And my wife was like, look, I don't think that's a long-term career.
And I said, hey, that's just a job to work my way through school.
So she started looking for other jobs.
These were just, you know, like part-time jobs.
I was taking a full load at school.
And so we looked through the WAN ads and she found an ad.
And I wish I had kept it, but we were under the impression it was a
security job, you know, some sort of security thing.
Security like a rent-a-cop kind of thing.
Yeah, like bouncer, you know, and I've always fancied myself as a big,
strong guy, so I thought that'd be great.
Went in to the temporary agency.
I think it was Volt applied for this job and found out that it was a
securities job and it was at large, one of the big, it's actually
Fidelity has a huge call center here in Salt Lake.
And they narrowed it down to two of us and they came out and the
interview person came out and said, you know, we've, we've, we can
only hire one of you and, you know, Carl, sorry, we've offered the
job to this guy and the guy turned to me and said, you know, I
don't want it, you can have it.
So that's, that's how I mean, yeah, it's pretty like people have
made a big deal of like, oh, how could he be, but that was 15
years ago, right?
Working my way through school, part-time job.
So basically people would, people who, if you have like a Fidelity
brokerage account, a retirement account, and you want to have
some basic question to ask and you call the 800 number, you
answer.
Yeah.
And remember, like, I have to keep reminding people, you
know, this was 95.
So remember they're like, Google finance didn't exist.
So like, I would literally get, you know, the same guy would
call every day at five o'clock and ask for 15 quotes.
He just wanted to like, how did stock in Pfizer do today?
Or how does stock in Microsoft do that?
Am I up or am I down?
To a large degree.
Yeah.
I was answering those calls.
I got thrown on the tax gate, which was pretty funny.
Um, every single phone call, you know, was, you know, somebody
asking me about some tax implication of something I'd
never heard of.
And every single phone call was like, please hold.
I'd have to go research, come back with the answer.
So that, that was the, that was the deal.
Carl worked his way up.
He got more training.
He stopped having to put everyone on hold.
And by 2003, he had his own clients.
He was working for Merrill Lynch.
He had three kids by this time.
He had a fourth on the way and he got an offer to go
work for Merrill Lynch in Las Vegas.
Vegas, baby Vegas.
It really was at the time, you know, it was the
heart of the boom and he took the job and moved there.
And he told us what it looked like when he got there.
We lived in an area of town, sort of west of the strip
up against the mountains out near Red Rocks, um, national
conservation area and the, I mean, you could almost see
the, the city, well you could, you could literally see
the city expanding into the desert, you know, like boom,
boom, boom, these new sort of rows of subdivisions.
And you'd go to these, even when we were coming down to
kind of visit, to make this decision, we, we started
going to a couple of these open houses of these new
communities open up and there would be lines of people.
And, you know, these would be 300, 400, 500, $600,000
houses, and there would be lines of people younger
than, you know, younger than we were.
And, and, and every new phase, the price would go up.
And so that's kind of the feeling you got of like, wow,
you know, these prices are increasing so fast.
We may not be able to buy a house if we don't now.
It was just like this train was leaving.
And if you weren't on it, you were never going to get on.
How much money were you making at the time and how
much were you looking to spend?
I know my income was getting closer to six figures.
It seems to me, we started looking at like 350 and, and
that sort of made sense to me for some reason, it's not
like I went through some big calculation.
It's just, it made sense to me.
We'd run the quick payment.
We'd say, well, we can afford that.
So that's where we started with 350 and we quickly, um,
you know, quickly things spike and like, well, if you just
can, you know, just spend 50,000 more, you get this
and you just spend a hundred, a hundred thousand more.
You get this.
So we ended up buying a house for 575 for sale by
owner and you've got to remember too, these are all
is almost painful for me to recount because in hindsight,
these things are all blazingly obvious.
I mean, we made, and the reason I, frankly, the reason
I told this story is we made, and hopefully it came
across in the way I wrote it was these are my
mistakes, right?
We made, we made mistakes and they look blazingly
obvious in the, in looking back, but at the time
you, it made sense and everywhere you looked, you
were reinforced with the idea and it was talked
about openly that you buy as much house as you
possibly can because the thing is just going up in
value, right?
There was this interesting shift and I was uncomfortable
with it, did it anyway, this interesting shift of
this isn't necessarily, you know, it's silly to
view this as just a home, right?
This is also one of the best opportunities to
increase your net worth you could ever have, right?
Cause these things are growing.
It's tax free, right?
You sell it two years later.
You don't have to pay taxes.
You can move it into a new house.
Um, you know, housing prices were going up.
My income was going up.
Like everything was going the right way, which
leads you to sort of another classic mistake,
which is sort of projecting the recent past into
the future infinitely, right?
What was that house like?
A single story, a 3,400 square feet, smallest
model in the neighborhood, a pretty unique
neighborhood in, in Las Vegas.
It was like sort of, um, multiple subdivisions
all behind one big, you know, everything in
Vegas is sort of fenced off, right?
Like gated communities everywhere.
And this was like four communities
behind one big gate.
So there was lots of people surrounded
by a central park.
The park, the green space, we called it
went under most of the roads to get to
the kid's school, the elementary school.
So it was really, really cool,
really fun place for the kids.
So they could walk to school, like
underneath the roads on these green
pathways or something.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And along the path, there were, uh,
like the tortoise and the hare statues.
Like, look, it was almost a little
surreal, frankly, looking back on it.
The tortoise and the hare, big, you
know, big tortoise, a big hare, you
know, like as they walk to their
public elementary school, which was
luckily one of the better schools
in the, in the County for sure.
Things are going really well.
So well that Carl decides he's
going to leave Merrill Lynch and
he's going to do that thing
that makes the economy grow.
He's going to start his own company.
And of course he needs some money
to do that.
And remember, we're still in the
boom here.
So his house, it's already
increased in value.
So get that money.
He does what everybody else does.
He takes out a second loan on his house.
A second loan.
And for a while, things are going well.
The kid's got a great school to go to.
He's getting new clients.
He can make his payments and then
things are not going so well.
The market starts to turn pretty abruptly.
And I know it's so, it's so easy.
And I get so frustrated with it.
Like so easy to look back.
Oh, we should have known.
Yeah.
I know we all should have known,
but the reality is go back.
I mean, there weren't a lot of
people sounding alarm bells.
All right.
I mean, I know there were some, I
know there were some, but most of us
were convinced nobody really wanted
to be the person at the party that
said, Hey, this thing's about to end.
So, right.
In comes going up, suddenly things
start to slow and they slow pretty
rapidly, right?
Remember late, late, um, late
08, you know, the whole sort of
Lehman AIG thing starts to unravel.
And then just, and I, I mean,
seriously at this point, I had a
sense that things were bad, right?
Like, and I remember being on bike
rides with friends that were smart
real estate folks and real estate
agents who, and one particularly
who was a real estate agent, but
one of the, you know, the
relatively rare real estate agents
that really cared about the value
of the investment he was helping
his client make rather than just
the commission.
And he said to me, you know,
we were both talking like, wow,
this will come back.
And I remember both looking at
each other and going, what if it
doesn't, right?
What if it doesn't?
And, and, and that was the
first time where I was like, wow,
what, what if it doesn't?
And then two, there was still
this sense of like, well, we
live in, you know, one of the
most desirable neighborhoods.
It's, it's a nice neighborhood.
We got the tortoise in the
hair.
Yeah.
Well, everybody in your
neighborhood was the hair.
Of course we, we have the
tortoise in there.
You're always trying to paint
this like, we'll be immune.
So the way Carl's business
works, he gets paid based on
how much money his clients
have invested.
So when the whole stock market
goes down by and large, Carl's
income goes down.
His family tries to cut back on
everything they can cut back on.
They cut back on trips.
They went from two cars down to
one car with four kids, but it
was not enough.
They still have too much house.
And finally, a friend advised
him to do something he'd been
avoiding, really trying not to
do at all costs.
His friend says to him, you
got to just stop paying your
mortgage.
And I remember being sort of
like, are you really like
that's, that's, and at the
same time, like relieve that
maybe, wait a second.
Maybe there's a way this could
work.
This wasn't a strategic
decision at this point.
It was like, we, well, it's,
it's hard to say we had no
choice because I guess we
could have figured out how to
borrow money from somebody
else.
I don't, at this point, it
felt like the only choice.
I called the bank, you're
current.
We can't work with you.
I say to the bank and they
literally said to me, look,
the department that works with
people is in sort of think of
it as another building.
Your file will not move over
to that building.
If you're current, like there's
nobody to talk to.
So we stopped, you know, and
that was, that was, that
was painful.
You know, I'm just terrified
of my kids opening the, you
know, the mail and, or
answering the phone.
And it's one of those
collection mortgage police,
you know, who are those
people are.
Remember thinking how, you
know, how are we ever going
to get out of this?
And we work through initially
a modification process with
the bank, uh, the modification
offer was, uh, wasn't going
to work.
There's no way.
Plus we needed to move.
So in the middle of that, we
were trying every angle.
Could we stay here?
Could we rent the house
slowly?
We run out of bullets, if
you will.
And all that's left is,
look, will you work with
us on a short sale?
You sold the house for, for
what hundreds of thousands of
dollars less than you owed
the bank and hundreds being
like between two and three.
And did that screw up your
credit?
I mean, is that a kind of
default?
Yes, it's, it, it shows up as
a settled for less than the
amount owed.
So I feel like there are a
lot of people, uh, in
America right now who are
in a situation not so
different from yours.
How are you doing now?
Years, years after this,
are you still, you're
still digging out?
Yeah.
I mean, it's 16.
What is it?
16 months.
You know, it was, it was
June of, of 2010.
So yeah, we're still
digging out.
I mean, my business is
good.
Um, we qualified for a, to
get a modest car loan, um,
and still, still digging
out.
I mean, we're getting
close, but still getting
out.
Couldn't buy a house right
now if, if we wanted to.
So you're a, you're a
parent of, of four,
right?
I feel like as a parent
you're always trying to
pass on your like life
lessons.
Like, I just learned this
like here.
You got to know this.
What do you, what have
you, how do you explain
this whole thing to them?
What do you tell them?
One thing I've decided, I
don't know if I'm right
about this or not, but
it feels right to me for
us, um, is our daughters
that are 12, 14 and 12,
almost 13 now, and our
10 year old son, as soon
as, you know, maybe
another year or two, uh,
we're going to involve
them much more in the
family financial
decisions.
We're going to help have
them understand these
trade-offs and you
know, why maybe we don't
want to go on that
vacation so we can fund
that college account or,
I mean, really I've
decided I may be wrong.
My kids knew that was
going on.
The kids know, and my
thought is, look, I don't
know that you can be too
open.
Um, so that's the
lesson I'm going to pass
on to them is we're
just going to walk
through the family
finances, help them
contribute to the family
finance discussion and
decide that there may
not be anything we
should hide.
I mean, so I, and I,
again, I don't know
where that line is.
Maybe there are some
things that they don't
need to know, but, um,
that's, that's what
we're going to, we're
going to talk to them
about.
So his kids are one
thing, David, but you
know, Carl is a
financial advisor.
So of course we asked
him, what, what does
this whole thing, this
whole experience say
about the basic nature
of his profession, the
basic idea of getting
paid to give financial
advice, because clearly,
you know, he was as
surprised by what
happened as everybody
else.
He said quite candidly,
yeah, this episode, it
did change things for
him.
He says actually a lot
of what he's learned
in general is from
making mistakes, the
same mistakes that he
now goes around trying
to help other people
avoid.
One of the things I've
found myself doing much
more recently is that
I used to spend a lot
of time focused on the
probability of a certain
event happening.
So if you think about
maybe failure, right?
The probability of this
not working and, you
know, maybe it's 5%.
Either you set this
sort of Robin, Robert
Rubin sort of idea of
like, you set the
probability at 5%.
Now, instead of just
focusing on the
probability of an
event, I find myself
focusing on the
consequence.
And so, right, if it's
a 5% chance, but if
it happens, you die.
I'm not, I'm no longer
saying, well, it's only
a 5%, I'm now saying,
but I would die.
And I think that is
the approach.
I know that's changed
in the advice I give.
And I know it's something
that's changed in the
way we are handling
things now.
And I hope that
continues for a long time.
I mean, I hope this
is, and I've said
this generally, I hope
this lesson seared and
sort of burned into all
of us that, that
there's nothing wrong
with taking risks, but
let's, let's understand
the implications of those
decisions and the
impact, not just the
probability.
We will link to
Carl's New York Times
story on our blog
at npr.org slash money.
Also check out our
colleague, Adam
Davidson's column.
It's going to run
this Sunday in the
New York Times
Sunday magazine.
It's about this
weird habit we have
in America where we
live pretty frugally
for 11 months and
then we spend, spend,
spend for this other month.
It's always December
for some reason.
If you know why that
may be, you can email
