You would never look at a map of the Hudson River, point to the spot where the Tappan Zee Bridge is, and say, "Put the bridge here!" The Tappan-Zee crosses one of the widest points on the Hudson — the bridge is more than three miles long. And if you go just a few miles south, the river gets much narrower. Our question for today's show: Why did they build a three-mile-long bridge when they could have built a much shorter, cheaper bridge nearby? Our search for an answer leads us to a forensic engineer, the Statue of Liberty, and a governor who wanted to be an opera singer.

You would never look at a map of the Hudson River, point to the spot where the Tappan Zee Bridge is, and say, "Put the bridge here!"

The Tappan Zee crosses one of the widest points on the Hudson — the bridge is more than three miles long. And if you go just a few miles south, the river gets much narrower. As you might expect, it would have been cheaper and easier to build the bridge across the narrower spot on the river.

So I wanted to answer a simple question: Why did they build the Tappan Zee where they did, rather than building it a few miles south?

I started digging through newspaper clippings from the 1940s and 1950s. It turns out, the bridge was part of a much larger project: The New York State Thruway, one of the first modern highway systems.

The clippings also reveal something suspicious. There was an alternate proposal for a bridge at a narrower spot nearby. The proposal was put forward by top engineers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

But that proposal was killed by New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. The New York Thruway was his baby; in a 1954 speech he proclaimed that it would be "the world's greatest highway."

I called historians, and libraries and historical societies. No one seemed to know for sure why Governor Dewey did what he did. Then I found Jim Doig, a professor emeritus at Princeton.

Doig interviewed some of the key government officials involved in the project, and knew the answer.

The Port Authority — the body that proposed putting the bridge further south — had a monopoly over all bridges built in a 25-mile radius around the Statue of Liberty.

If the bridge had been built just a bit south of its current location — that is, if it had been built across a narrower stretch of the river — it would have been in the territory that belonged to the Port Authority.

As a result, the Port Authority — not the State of New York — would have gotten the revenue from tolls on the bridge. And Dewey needed that toll revenue to fund the rest of the Thruway.

So Dewey was stuck with a three-mile-long bridge.

Today, the Tappan Zee is in bad shape, and the State of New York is looking into fixing or replacing it. But none of the proposals would move the bridge to a narrower spot on the river. It's too late now: Highways and towns have grown up based on the bridge's current location.

We're stuck with a long bridge at one of the widest spots in the river. The repairs are expected to cost billions of dollars.

DAVID GREENE, host:

Now we bring you the story of a bridge. If you've ever driven along the upper east coast, there's a good chance you know that very long bridge north of New York City. It's called the Tappan Zee, and it was built, strangely, in what seems to be the spot that makes the least economic sense - across one of the widest parts of the Hudson River. David Kestenbaum with our Planet Money team found out what happened.

DAVID KESTENBAUM: Todd Ottman was an assistant managing editor for the Encyclopedia of New York State. He remembers when it got time to do the T entries. He'd grown up in the area and always wondered why the Tappan Zee Bridge seemed to be built in the wrong place.

Mr. TODD OTTMAN (Encyclopedia Editor): Always. Every day, actually. My bedroom window - as a teenager I'd get up in the morning and there was the bridge. Why is it there at one of the widest points in the river?

KESTENBAUM: Ottman looked around for a historian, an expert.

Mr. OTTMAN: We just we couldn't find anybody.

KESTENBAUM: And historical documents weren't much help either. I thought there might be an engineering reason why the Tappan Zee was built where it was. Maybe the river is shallower there. So I went to see the bridge with a forensic engineer, Robert Hintersteiner.

Mr. ROBERT HINTERSTEINER (Forensic Engineer): You see the superstructure, steel work.

KESTENBAUM: That is a long bridge.

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: Three-point-two miles.

(Soundbite of laughter)

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: Yes, it is.

KESTENBAUM: As an engineer, where would you build this bridge?

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: Personally? I would build at the narrowest point...

(Soundbite of laughter)

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: ...but not the longest point.

(Soundbite of laughter)

KESTENBAUM: How narrow is narrowest point?

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: One mile.

KESTENBAUM: Today, the bridge is not in great shape. The state of New York is now officially looking at replacing the Tappan Zee. It could cost $6 billion or more. Hintersteiner says this is a lousy place to build a bridge. The river floor is mucky.

If they had built this at a narrower part of the river, would we be in this mess?

Mr. HINTERSTEINER: No, due to the fact that they would have hit solid rock.

KESTENBAUM: Reading through old newspaper clippings from the 1940's and 50's, the plot thickens. The bridge, it turns out, was part of a much larger, very high-stakes project, one of the first highway systems, the New York State Thruway.

Again, Todd Ottman.

Mr. OTTMAN: This was a limited access highway that you could do high speeds on.

KESTENBAUM: What we think of today as a modern highway, but back then, the idea you could go that far without hitting an intersection or a traffic light.

Mr. OTTMAN: Right, right, right, right. Yes, it didn't exist then.

KESTENBAUM: The old newspaper clippings also reveal something suspicious. It turns out, there was an alternate proposal for a bridge at a narrower spot a little further south. The proposal was put forward by top engineers at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but it got killed by this man...

Governor THOMAS DEWEY (Former Governor of New York): The Thruway will span a new six-lane bridge across Hudson River between...

KESTENBAUM: Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York. This is a speech from 1954.

Gov. DEWEY: The completed thruway will be the world's greatest highway, the longest toll facility...

KESTENBAUM: I called historians and libraries and historical societies - no one seemed to know for sure why Governor Dewey did what he did. And then I found Jim Doig.

Mr. JIM DOIG (Professor Emeritus, Princeton University): My name is Jim Doig, and I'm professor emeritus at Princeton University and currently also teaching at Dartmouth College.

KESTENBAUM: Doig interviewed some of the key government officials involved before they died, and he found why the Tappan Zee bridge was built where it was. The answer: money. The bridge, remember, was a centerpiece of a gigantic highway system, and tolls on the bridge were going to raise a lot of money. Governor Dewey wanted that money to help pay for the rest of the Thruway. And, here's the catch: If he had let the bridge be built further south, where the river narrows, it would have been in Port Authority territory. And the Port Authority, not the state of New York, would have gotten the revenue. Port Authority territory, weirdly, is defined as a big circle centered around - what else? The Statue of Liberty.

Mr. DOIG: Twenty-five mile radius of Statue of Liberty.

KESTENBAUM: The bridge is just a smidge outside of it, Jim Doig says about 2/10ths of one mile. Governor Dewey put the bridge about as close as he could to the line.

Mr. DOIG: It's right there.

(Soundbite of laughter)

KESTENBAUM: He was stuck with a three-mile bridge.

Mr. DOIG: He was definitely stuck with a three-mile bridge, unless wanted to go for a four-mile bridge a little further north.

(Soundbite of laughter)

KESTENBAUM: None of the proposals today for replacing the bridge would put it in a narrower spot. It's too late now. We've got highways and towns everywhere. We are stuck with a long bridge at one of the widest spots in the river.

**faster whisper:**
Dramatically, that's come down to 5.3% for Italy and 5.5% for Spain, so a huge move in
the borrowing costs for these two countries, thanks to the European Central Bank's intervention
buying up their bonds.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm David Kestinbaum.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today's Tuesday, August 9th, and that was market analyst Louise Cooper you heard at
the top.
She works for the global brokerage firm BGC Partners.
Today on the podcast, we find the answer to a decades-long mystery, why a very big
bridge got built in the wrong place.
The story has a forensic engineer, the Statue of Liberty, and a governor who wanted to
be an opera singer.
But first, David, let me give you the Planet Money indicator.
Today's Planet Money indicator is 2.37%.
The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, that's the interest rate the government
has to pay to borrow money for 10 years, it's 2.37% today.
And yeah, I know that I keep using Treasury rates as the indicator, I keep coming back
to it, but I really think that the interest rate on Treasury bonds is super interesting
this summer.
You know, first there was the whole debt ceiling thing, and I talked about it then.
And then now, of course, just a few days ago, Standard & Poor's downgraded the
United States credit rating, that's basically S&P saying, we're slightly less confident
now that the U.S. is going to be able to pay its debts in the long term.
And yes, of course, the stock market has been going down this week.
But S&P, they were not talking about the stock market.
They were really talking about bonds.
They were talking about U.S. bonds.
And what happened to the interest rate on U.S. government bonds this week?
The interest rate actually went down.
Investors are actually more eager to lend money to the U.S. government now than
they were before the downgrade.
And you know, on one level, this is not terribly surprising.
S&P did not have any inside information.
It was just voicing its opinion based on facts that are available to everyone.
And you know, David, as we talked about on the podcast the other day, most treasury bonds
are held by these big institutions that do their own research, make their own decisions,
and don't pay that much attention to the rating agencies.
But you know, still, given all the headlines over the weekend about how the downgrade
might lead to higher borrowing costs for the U.S., I do think it's worth pointing
out that at least for now, the government's borrowing costs have actually gone down.
Thank you, Jacob.
Sure.
The story today starts with a question my girlfriend's dad asked me one day over brunch.
His name is Steve Kagan.
And I have to say the question, when I heard it, it seemed a little bit like a conspiracy
theory to me.
You can hear me okay?
I can.
All right.
Steve, you remember when we went out to brunch here in New York City?
I do.
Do you remember you asked me a question about a bridge?
About a bridge?
About a bridge.
No, I don't.
I can't believe you don't remember.
Oh, about the Tappan Zee Bridge.
The Tappan Zee Bridge.
Yeah.
Do you remember what you said?
I said that, to my knowledge, the Tappan Zee Bridge was built across the single widest
point in the entire course of the Hudson River, which seemed bizarre to me because
it seemed like it would add so much to the construction cost, so there might be
other motives.
But when that bridge was built, which I think was when I was in high school,
there was just lots of talk on the street about that this was just evidence of corruption,
that the bridge should be built right at that particular spot.
Do you remember what I said to you?
I said, well, maybe there was a reason.
Maybe they built it there because the river was shallowest where it was widest,
so it made engineering sense.
Yeah.
You said something like that, and I always grant that.
There may be lots of engineering reasons that I know nothing about.
All right.
So after we talked, I made one phone call and then another and then another and
then another.
Since then, I've been trying to figure out the answer.
Have you really?
And I think I have the answer.
What's the answer?
Come on, man.
That is a totally cheap trick to open the podcast with a cliffhanger like that.
I'll get to it, man.
In my defense, it does kind of take a whole podcast to explain.
OK, so let's do it.
So the Tappan Zee Bridge, it's this very long bridge across the Hudson River,
a little bit north of New York City.
I've driven across it a bunch of times.
You, I'm sure, have driven across it a bunch of times.
It's not some relic.
It's this big, high traffic bridge.
After Steve posed that question, I looked at a map here.
Here's a map, Jacob.
And it does look pretty ridiculous.
The bridge is at one of the widest parts of the river.
I mean, in fact, if the bridge had been built just slightly further south,
it gets a lot narrower.
It'd be much easier to build the bridge there.
You would never look at a map of the Hudson River and point to the spot
where the Tappan Zee is and say, oh, yeah, let's build a bridge right here.
Remember, my idea was that maybe it made engineering sense to build it there.
So one of my first calls was to an engineer.
I found this guy, Robert Hintersteiner.
He's a forensic engineer who lives near the bridge.
And he said, yeah, come on up.
I'll show you the bridge.
I hadn't driven over the Tappan Zee in a few years.
I was kind of excited to see it.
See, this is the bridge here.
Oh, yeah.
I'll just pull up there.
We'll take off.
You get yourself a feeling for it.
OK.
So we get out.
It's really windy.
We are standing there on the banks of the Hudson River,
looking up at this giant bridge.
And up close, it seems even more absurd.
We see the superstructure.
That's all the steel work.
That is a long bridge.
3.2 miles.
Yes, it is.
As an engineer, where would you build this bridge?
Personally, I would build the narrowest point,
but not the longest point.
How narrow is the narrowest point?
One mile.
Hintersteiner told me that my idea that maybe it made
engineering sense to build there is just wrong.
He says there is no engineering reason to build it here.
It is, in fact, a really crappy place
to build a bridge, especially such a long one.
When you've got a bridge that long,
you can't just anchor it to the rock
on either side of the river.
You've got to sink some supports down
in the middle of the river.
And it's pretty mucky down there.
They had to do this tricky thing where you hold up
the bridge in the middle on these floating supports.
And Hintersteiner says that there's even more alarming
news about the bridge because of its length
and the way it was built, it needs a lot of maintenance.
In fact, now, if it doesn't get some repairs,
eventually, it could collapse.
It's going to happen, I figure, sometime 2021,
July, something like that.
July, that's pretty specific.
July 14th?
No, 30th.
A Friday night.
I'm just guessing.
It's part of a novel I'm writing on it.
Wait a minute, David.
A novel, he says.
I was with this guy, right?
Forensic engineer.
OK, I totally believe him.
But now it turns out he's a fiction writer.
He's a guy who makes things up as a hobby
for a living or something.
Look, if everyone has one novel in him,
this is his novel.
This is a guy obsessed with the bridge
who also wants to write a book.
Call it tap and Z.
My editor, working on this, is saying
I have to change the title.
I wrote 100 pages.
They said I need 300, 400 pages,
so I'm rewriting the whole thing.
And I have to put sex in it.
I have to put violence.
I have to put conspiracy.
I have to wall this thing.
But enlaced in that is the history of the bridge.
Talking to Hintersteiner made the tap and Z
even more mysterious.
Not only was it in the wrong place,
but its location kind of sealed its fate.
He points down the river.
He says, look at the George Washington bridge.
That one, which is older than the tap and Z bridge,
it is doing fine, because the river
is just like a mile across.
They anchored it in rock on both sides.
The tap and Z is not in such good shape.
If they built this at a narrower part of the river,
would we be in this mess?
No, due to the fact that they would hit solid rock.
David, let me just jump in here and say,
it's not just this one engineer slash novelist
who is saying this.
The government is actually officially
looking at replacing the bridge.
And doing that could cost $6 billion.
In calling around, I heard various conspiracy theories
about why the bridge wasn't built
somewhere more sensible.
One was that Nelson Rockefeller didn't
want it to spoil the view from his estate.
That seems not to be true.
To answer the question, I went to the one book.
Yes, a book, an actual book, 2,000 pages long,
that I figure it's got to have
the answer to this question in it.
Oh, it's the Encyclopedia of New York State.
This is Todd Ottman.
He was assistant managing editor on the Encyclopedia.
He remembers when it came time to tackle the T's
and the tap and Z entry,
because he grew up in the area,
and he'd always wondered about why the bridge
seemed to be built in the wrong place.
Always.
Every day, actually, my bedroom window,
as a teenager, I'd get up in the morning
and there was the bridge.
Why is it there at one of the widest points in the river?
So you thought about that question.
Oh, every, I mean, almost everyone brings this up
when they're driving it over,
and who has some knowledge of the Hudson River.
Like, why is it here?
This seems insanity, you know.
So the time came to write this encyclopedia entry,
figure out the answer to this mystery,
and they had a problem.
We looked around, who could write it?
And we couldn't find anybody.
But it's a huge bridge.
I mean, there aren't that many bridges, right?
True, but we just, we couldn't find anybody.
So Todd's boss turned to him and said,
well, you do it.
And Todd does what any historian would do.
He starts to look back at some old newspaper articles.
And when you read these old articles,
you realize that the Tappan Zee Bridge
was part of a much larger, very high stakes project,
the New York State Thruway.
A long highway, hundreds of miles long.
And at some point, it's got to cross the Hudson River.
There's this critical crossing.
And that is the Tappan Zee Bridge.
This was a novel idea at the time,
this new type of road that you could only get
on and off of in certain places.
I mean, this was a limited access highway
with no stoplights that you could do high speeds on,
that you had great, at least 1,000 foot site distance.
What we think of today as a modern highway,
but back then, the idea that you could go that far
without hitting an intersection or a traffic lane.
You can just get up to speed and just keep driving.
That was sort of new and exciting.
Yes, it didn't exist then.
So this was revolutionary.
And reading these old articles, the plot thickens.
Because it turns out there was a competing proposal
to build a bridge at a much narrower spot,
just a few miles down the river.
It was proposed by top bridge engineers
with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
kind of an independent entity,
the folks who ended up building
the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.
But this proposal died a mysterious death.
Death?
Why death?
Not just death, it was, it was murder.
I can tell you who did it.
From the clippings, it was the governor, Thomas E. Dewey.
Dewey, who was almost president of the U.S.
Dewey from that famous wrong newspaper headline,
Dewey Defeats Truman.
Yeah, same guy.
And Tappanzee Bridge was actually part
of this much larger project, the New York State Thruway.
And today, you know what the name
of the New York State Thruway is?
It is the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
Got named after him.
Here, I actually found some tape
of Governor Dewey talking about it.
Construction contracts totaling $415 million.
Oh, I should say this is Governor Dewey
giving his annual address
to the New York legislature back in 1954.
In the summer of 1955,
the Thruway will span a new six-lane bridge
across the Hudson River between Nyack and Tarrytown
and continue through Westchester County
to the major Deegan Expressway in New York City.
The completed Thruway will be the world's greatest highway.
He really sounds like a governor there.
Yeah, Dewey was known for his voice.
Actually, he started out wanting to be an opera singer.
Governor was like a backup career option
for him or something.
Anyway, we know there was this proposal
by the Port Authority to build a bridge
at a narrow spot in the river.
And for some reason, Governor Dewey killed it.
Here, I found the New York Times article
from 1950, When It Happened.
So at the top of the article,
there are a bunch of headlines.
You know the way newspapers used to run headlines
all down the page, and it's super dramatic.
So I'll just read through them.
It goes,
Port body gives in on Thruway span,
accedes to Dewey's orders
and will let the bridge be built
wherever his engineers say.
Governor hints secret implies war-born construction idea
will be used and says all will be known soon.
It's like the Wizard of Oz.
I know I was a little over the top reading it there,
but it is over the top, right?
All will be known soon.
Can you imagine a headline today
like Obama hints secret says all will be known.
So as this article lays it out,
what Governor Dewey is saying basically is,
look, I'm killing that other bridge idea.
We're gonna build the bridge instead
at a really wide part of the river.
Don't worry about how much it's gonna cost
or the engineering challenges.
I have a secret technology we're gonna use.
So this is the implies war-born construction idea
will be used.
Yeah, it's the part where they end up floating
the middle of the bridge to support it.
Most unique feature of the bridge
is the use of huge underwater boxes,
eight in number which rest on the river bottom
at mid-channel and serve as buoyant foundations
to support about 70% of the bridge's dead weight.
Jacob, as I'm looking through this old material,
Todd Ottman, the historian, wrote me
and he mentioned that he thought
Thomas Dewey's son was still alive
and living in New York.
It was true and I tracked him down.
It turns out he works just around the corner
from here.
Your name is Thomas Dewey?
Junior.
Thomas Dewey, the governor, was your father.
He was.
Do you know or did your dad ever talk about
why the Tappanzee Bridge got built where it got built?
No, I can't remember that.
It never came up at dinner or anything
around the dinner table?
I mean, I was a kid paying no attention
to things like that at that point.
David, this is really a kind of a sad moment
in the podcast series.
Like, I've been with you so far.
I went to the bridge with you.
I went to Dewey with you.
I feel like you found his son.
Now I'm finally gonna know the answer
and I'm kind of let down right now.
I did learn from Thomas Dewey Jr.
that the Thruway was a big point of pride,
at least for him and the family.
Thomas Dewey Jr. told me that he still to this day
is upset when people don't call the Thruway
by its proper name.
He has called up local radio stations
when they are giving traffic reports.
He calls them and he says,
look, it's not the New York Thruway.
It is the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
But nobody listens to him.
Hearing from Dewey's son is a reminder
that this little piece of history,
this question you're trying to answer, David,
it really happened pretty recently.
Yeah, it's almost like some of these people
might still be alive today who were involved.
And I did find a historian
who had interviewed some of the players
in the 1980s before they died
and they gave him the answer.
The historian's name is Jim Doig.
My name is Jim Doig
and I'm a professor emeritus at Princeton University
and currently also teaching at Dartmouth College.
Doig says the reason why the Tappanzee Bridge
was built where it was, it's about money.
The bridge, remember, is the centerpiece
of this giant Thruway highway project.
And the tolls on the Tappanzee Bridge
were going to raise a lot of money.
And Dewey needed that money to help pay
for the rest of the Thruway
for hundreds of miles of road.
And here's the catch.
If he had built the bridge further south,
Dewey wouldn't have got that toll revenue
because the Tappanzee Bridge would have been
in Port Authority territory.
The Port Authority's territory weirdly is defined
as a big circle centered around,
what else, the Statue of Liberty.
Within a 25-mile radius of the Statue of Liberty.
So if I take out like a protractor,
like in a geometry class,
and I stick the point into the Statue of Liberty
on the map and I draw a circle 25 miles radius?
That's right.
It might hurt the statue a little bit,
but yes, that would be a sacrifice worthwhile.
Then you could see what the 25 miles are.
I'm picking, the mic's really good.
It picks up sort of paper shuffling, so.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, that's the map.
Oh, it's the map.
Oh, you look, you have the map there.
I have a map right here.
That's right.
Otherwise I might not know any of this, you see.
Can you put your finger on the Tappanzee?
Oh yes, easily.
Okay, do it.
Could you hear that?
I could.
And then how far above the Port Authority
of New York line is that?
About half a mile.
It's right there.
Oh yes, very much right there.
They could have run that line a little lower
and then it would have been easy for Dewey
to have a much narrower area for his bridge.
But as it was, he was stuck with a three mile bridge.
He was definitely stuck with a three mile bridge
unless he wanted to go to a four mile bridge.
Jacob, the map is kind of amazing.
Like, Port Authority territory ends right here
and then like just a smidge higher up
is where he stuck the bridge.
And you know, Dewey was the governor, right?
He was the boss of New York.
You'd think he could build the bridge
wherever he wanted to.
But the Port Authority had been granted
this monopoly in the region.
In other words, only the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey could build
bridges or tunnels within that 25 mile radius
of the Statue of Liberty.
And the Port Authority used that monopoly power
to help it borrow money for bridges and tunnels.
It could say, look, lend us money,
we'll pay you back.
You don't have to worry so much about it
because no one else is gonna be able
to build a bridge or tunnel.
The monopoly thing was even written into the bond.
So it was very hard for the governor
to get around.
So the reason Dewey puts the bridge
in this ridiculous place is if he had put it
in what seems like the rational place,
a few miles south where the river is much narrower,
it would have been a Port Authority bridge.
The Port Authority would have gotten
all the money from the tolls
and Dewey would not have had the money
to build this freeway, this thruway
that he thought was really important
for the future of New York.
So in that way, I mean, within this sort of crazy
set of rules that Dewey was operating under,
this for him was a rational choice.
I should say this story about the bridge,
it was one of the ones that was floating around out there,
but I could not find a real reliable source for it
until I talked to Jim Doig.
And this story that you just heard
is the story I told Steve Kagan over the phone,
my girlfriend's dad who started all this.
Remember, he thought it was corruption
and I thought there might be some engineering reason.
I feel vindicated.
Yes, I think you won.
It was not an engineering issue, certainly.
And I feel vindicated in the sense that,
it wasn't built there because it was a good place
to build the bridge.
That seemed pretty obvious.
I don't quite know who to be angry at though,
or who to blame.
Well, can something be a bad idea
even if there's nobody to blame for it?
Maybe that's the folder I'll put this one in,
a bad idea, but we don't know who to blame for it.
That's probably a pretty big folder
