The crisis in Japan is a horrible human tragedy. Is it also an economic disaster? There are big, short-term economic problems. On today's show, a man who works at a major Japanese truck and bus manufacturer describes widespread factory closures and disruptions in the supply of parts. But in the long-term, for all of the suffering, Japan's economy is likely to bounce back from the disaster.

The crisis in Japan is a horrible human tragedy. Is it also an economic disaster?

There are big, short-term economic problems. On today's show, a man who works at a major Japanese truck and bus manufacturer describes widespread factory closures and disruptions in the supply of parts.

But in the long-term, for all of the suffering, Japan's economy is likely to bounce back from the disaster.

In a developed economy, it turns out, you can have an earthquake that shifts a country by eight feet, and the economy will barely register it.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

And I'm Adam Davidson. Today is Tuesday, March 22. That was friend of the show Mohamed El-Erian. He's the CEO of PIMCO - I believe they are the world's largest private bond fund - speaking to Bloomberg News at the top. Today on the show, we talk about the economics of the crisis in Japan. But first, from Jacob Goldstein, the PLANET MONEY indicator, sir.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 39 billion.

KESTENBAUM: I know that one because we were talking about it this morning. That is how much AT&T is going to pay to buy PLANET MONEY.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: It is a big day for PLANET MONEY. Our listeners won't notice any difference. We'll continue to cover the wonders of the cellular phone industry.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: Right. No. So it's how much AT&T has offered to pay for T-Mobile, which - not quite as big of a deal as them buying PLANET MONEY. But it's a really big deal. And obviously, you know, if you've got a cellphone, you want to know, does this mean my cellphone bill's going to go up? Am I about to get screwed?

KESTENBAUM: Because the danger is that when you have mergers like this, you're losing competition. And if you have something that's close to a monopoly, they can just charge whatever they want. They could start charging more for cellphone plans.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. And, you know, that's why we have antitrust laws. That's why the government is allowed to block this kind of deal if they want to, basically. And to understand how the government is going to think through this process, I called Harry First. He's an antitrust expert at NYU Law School. And what he said is you can basically think of this deal in two ways. You can look at the country as one big market, or you can look at the country as a bunch of different little markets in cities all around the country.

KESTENBAUM: Now, since I sit next to you, Jacob, I heard you working on this this morning. And it kind of got me obsessed with all these tiny cellphone companies all over the U.S., which I did not realize existed. I came up with a lovely list. Here's Appalachian Wireless, the cell provider for Eastern Kentucky. There's Alaska Digitel, Alaska Wireless, Alaska Communications Systems (ph), my personal favorite in Alaska, the Arctic Slope Telephone Association Cooperative cellular system.

GOLDSTEIN: Let me just jump in here because I can hear you're still only on A.

KESTENBAUM: Right.

GOLDSTEIN: And I think we get the idea. And AT&T would actually be very happy to hear you rattling off this list. This is how they want us to think of this market because they say if you look around the country, in almost every city, there are a bunch of different wireless providers. Yes, some of them are a little. But, you know, if you're a customer in that city, you still have choices. There is still competition. And, you know - so, OK, there are a few places where the competition is more limited. And AT&T says, in those cities, we'll spin off some of our business so that there is competition.

DAVIDSON: We'll sell it to Appalachian Wireless.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Or we'll sell it to Cincinnati Bell wireless.

GOLDSTEIN: One more.

DAVIDSON: Or we'll sell it to Cricket Communications.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: Thank you. Yes. And this actually first told me this is how mergers often work. You know, the government looks city by city. You see it, for example, with airlines where they'll sort of work out a deal with the government where they're like, OK, you know, if we're too big in Newark, we'll get rid of some of our gates there so that it's still competitive in Newark.

KESTENBAUM: All right. But if you think of it nationally, though - right? - nationally, what do you have? You have AT&T. You have Verizon. And then there's Sprint still, right?

GOLDSTEIN: It falls off a lot, right? Basically, if this deal goes through nationally, there will be two gargantuan cellphone companies, Verizon and AT&T. Between the two of them, they'll have more than 200 million subscribers. Remember; entire country, we have something like 310 million people. So...

DAVIDSON: That includes babies.

GOLDSTEIN: Includes babies and a few others without cellphones presumably - right? - so an incredibly concentrated market in two companies if you think about this nationally. And on this level, first, I'd say, yeah, the market may get less competitive. That would mean, you know, people could pay more for cellphone service. There's less incentive to innovate - all the reasons you want competition.

KESTENBAUM: And the other concern there - right? - is that when Apple comes out with its new phone and it wants to strike an exclusive deal, it's not going to go with Appalachia Wireless (ph), right? It's going to go with one of these two big ones. And then they don't really - they don't have a lot of choice. So another fear might be that you have less competition there.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. That's definitely another side of the market and another valid way to look at it.

KESTENBAUM: Thank you so much, Jacob. I'd also like to thank Pine Cellular, serving McCurtain, Le Flore and Latimer counties in southeastern Oklahoma for all of their cellular communication needs. Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks.

KESTENBAUM: All right, now onto today's show. The crisis in Japan, of course, is primarily a horrible human tragedy. Thousands of people lost their lives. Hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people, are right now suffering and scared. And we have heard lots of great coverage here on NPR. We've read great articles about it. But here at PLANET MONEY, our job is to cover the economics.

DAVIDSON: And many of our listeners have written in asking questions about it. Like, what does the earthquake, the tsunami, the fear of a nuclear meltdown - what does all that mean for the global economy, for Japan's economy? It's a human tragedy. It's a natural disaster. Is it also potentially a global economic disaster?

KESTENBAUM: We've spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about disasters and crises in poor and middle-income countries, like Haiti, Egypt, Libya. But how does a tragedy like this look when you're the third richest country in the world?

DAVIDSON: First off, we learned that the earthquake and the tsunami are causing at least some short-term economic disruptions.

SHINICHI SATO: My name is Shinichi, S-H-I-N-H...

KESTENBAUM: I...

SATO: I...

KESTENBAUM: Shinichi Sato works at Hino Motors. They're the largest manufacturer of commercial trucks and buses in Japan, although Shinichi is based in the U.S. They also make axles for a variety of Toyota vehicles. He says Hino Motors - they have been dramatically affected, at least in the short term.

SATO: In Japan, they shut down the plant - whole plant for last week, so one week. And today and tomorrow, they're shut down also.

DAVIDSON: So they shut down all their plants for one week, and it looks like today and tomorrow also.

SATO: Yes. This is not only Hino but all the automobile company, I think - same situation right now.

DAVIDSON: And why are they shut down?

SATO: Because many of the parts are - comes from that area. And also right now, due to the power shortage, they cannot operate the plant whole day.

DAVIDSON: Can you give me an example of a part that was manufactured in the earthquake region that is now difficult to get?

SATO: Oh, many - so many parts. For example, some tires, oil seal or bearing...

DAVIDSON: Bearings.

SATO: ...Fuel filter. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: All the little things that you never think about inside your car or truck. How many parts go into a truck?

SATO: So many (laughter). In the case of truck, thousands of parts. Even the rear axle for Toyota, if you go one by one, maybe hundreds of parts.

DAVIDSON: So we found a bunch of similar stories just today. Honda and Toyota announced they won't be able to restart their auto assembly lines yet because they can't get enough rubber and resin products from the affected areas.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. And I saw this. GM is laying off 59 workers in Buffalo, N.Y., at their Tonawanda truck engine plant because GM is producing fewer trucks because they can't get all the right material from Japan. And since they're producing fewer trucks, they need fewer workers.

DAVIDSON: So clearly, there are lots of short-term disruptions all over the world. But we wanted to know, is this going to be a long-term economic problem? We got Arthur Alexander into a studio. He's an economist at Georgetown University. And for 10 years, he was the president of the Japan Economic Institute in Washington, D.C.

KESTENBAUM: I told him I always feel a bit uncomfortable when there are these big disasters or crises in the world and we jump in wanting to talk about money and how does it affect business? It's important to do. But I always am afraid it comes off badly.

ARTHUR ALEXANDER: This is the discomfort that we feel, especially as economists. We seem to take a particularly coldhearted view that just confirms everyone's feelings about economists.

KESTENBAUM: But you don't think it's coldhearted?

ALEXANDER: Well, it is in a way. But you have to - you know, we acknowledge. I have watched carefully and closely the videos of the tsunami and the disasters. And my wife says, you know, you're not going to be able to go to sleep after this. And it's utterly horrifying. And yet, we step back away from that and go through the numbers. And we add it all up.

DAVIDSON: And when you add it up, he says it looks like this is unlikely to be a long-term economic problem for Japan. He says this is actually the case with advanced economies. You can have an earthquake that shifts your nation by 8 feet, and the economy will barely register it.

ALEXANDER: One of the great things about modern economies is they have tremendous redundancy, resilience, robustness to these sorts of things. And you can often quickly figure out ways to work around the disruptions that you do confront. I think the afflicted parts of the country are really pretty small part of the total nation, the total economy. The most hard-hit prefecture, equivalent to an American state, is under 2% - something like 1.5% of the total output of the country, same as the population. So it's a small percentage of the total. And the robustness of the economy and the redundancies means that it takes days to weeks, usually, to reconfigure your production networks and where you do things to work around the problems.

KESTENBAUM: Is this on purpose? When you say a modern economy - and what you mean is a rich, industrialized nation. I mean, we saw in Haiti, obviously, that Haiti did not have these redundant systems. It did not have this resilience. And its GDP was hit severely.

ALEXANDER: And still is hit.

KESTENBAUM: And still is hit, yeah. They had, you know, really one or two functioning ports, both of which were severely damaged. They had one real international airport that was severely damaged. I mean, in other words, we're not talking about poor nations. We're talking about Japan, Europe, the United States, Canada...

ALEXANDER: That's right.

KESTENBAUM: ...When we talk about resilience in a...

ALEXANDER: That's right.

KESTENBAUM: ...Modern economy.

ALEXANDER: I think that sums it up. We are - we're not Haiti. Japan is not Haiti. It has these networks, these redundancies, these multiple facilities. And it's not planned. It's just the way things have developed. We have both business decisions and some political decisions to put in a - multiple systems that really have this tremendous robustness in the face of damage. And you couldn't plan it better. It - but it happened kind of automatically.

KESTENBAUM: Alexander told us this interesting story about the allies during World War II were trying to figure out, what can we bomb inside Nazi Germany - obviously, a big industrialized nation - that will disrupt their economy? Is there something we can bomb that'll just mess everything up?

DAVIDSON: And they thought, and they thought. And then they said, oh, we have it - ball bearings. You need ball bearings. We'll take out the ball bearing factories.

KESTENBAUM: And that was actually interesting for me to hear 'cause my grandfather worked in the ball bearings industry during World War II in Worcester, Mass. And to this day, he will proudly say, you can't fight a world war without ball bearings. But even though we bombed Nazi ball bearings factories, they very quickly worked out other ways to get ball bearings, other ways to make ball bearings. And it just didn't have a major economic impact. And Arthur Alexander says we see this again and again, at least with modern industrialized nations. They're disrupted by war, by natural disaster. And they just get over it remarkably quickly.

DAVIDSON: He went through the history in Japan. It has an awful history with earthquakes. In the 1923 earthquake and a fire in Tokyo killed 142,000 people. The physical damage was something like a third of the country's entire GDP. In 1995, there was the massive Kobe earthquake, which hit a major industrial area.

ALEXANDER: Kobe is something like the third-largest port in the country. And it served both national shipping, and it was a great international port. They had 35 containerized berths. They were all knocked out of commission. And the highways that we saw, there were - the toppled freeway overspans (ph) that just came down, the railroads were twisted messes. Now, it turns out, further inland, there were other networks - transportation networks that survived. And so a lot of the traffic was simply shifted over to those other arteries. This is the redundancy - that if one line goes down, there are other lines to take up the slack. And so production rapidly recovered.

DAVIDSON: You sent me this amazing chart showing GDP around the time of the Kobe earthquake. And the title was Spot the Quake.

ALEXANDER: Right.

KESTENBAUM: You can't see it there.

ALEXANDER: You can't see it. This is the amazing thing. Even looking back at 1923, when the damage, relatively speaking, was much greater, that year is kind of lost in the noise of the ups and downs. And this is why I say that the current event - the current disaster - you won't be able to see very much of it. And I would think that a few years from now, looking back, again, you might have some problems picking it out of the noise.

DAVIDSON: There's a bunch of reasons why a disaster like this doesn't really show up in the economic data. So the main economic data that people use is GDP - gross domestic product - which is a measure of all the economic activity in a given year. When something of value is destroyed, that doesn't necessarily show up in GDP. If there's a bridge that was built 10 years ago, and it's still really valuable, people use it all the time, but it wasn't built this year, then it doesn't show up in this year's GDP.

KESTENBAUM: And if it gets destroyed, they don't then take that out of GDP in the year it gets destroyed.

DAVIDSON: They don't take out the destruction of any assets. I saw this when I was doing economic stories on Katrina in New Orleans. Katrina destroyed an awful lot in New Orleans and Gulfport and throughout that region. But it didn't have a sizable impact on measurable GDP. In some cases, disasters like this can be positive for GDP.

KESTENBAUM: Japan, right now, is going to have to rebuild, right? And when you rebuild, you have to hire workers and build houses and new roads, and that's going to add to GDP. The estimates are that repairing the damage is going to cost $100 billion, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars. Here's Arthur Alexander again.

ALEXANDER: The rebuilding itself is investment. It will create a lot of economic activity to do that. The construction industry in particular, which has been hard-hit for the last 10 years, will benefit greatly from this. But will also create income, profit. There are going to be workers out there doing it. It'll be like the stimulus program in the United States during the recession. It will create the jobs, the income, the consumption, that will percolate through to the rest of the economy. So that will also add to GDP. So that's one benefit, in a way. The other side of that is, how do you pay for it? Japan has huge debt.

KESTENBAUM: It's bigger than ours by a lot - right? - relative to the size of our economy.

ALEXANDER: Right. So no matter how you can slice it, it's big. And paying for the recovery operations is going to require raising money somehow, either through debt or through increasing taxes. And Japanese government has been talking about increasing taxes for the last 10 years. It never seemed to be the right time. This looks to be an ideal political time to go ahead and do something they should have been doing anyway.

DAVIDSON: So obviously, the key thing right now is the immediate loss of life, the immediate suffering. And there's no putting a pretty face on that. That is awful. But looking at it economically, as - you know, that's our part of this story at PLANET MONEY. It sounds like - and I almost hate to use this word. But it sounds like there are positives and negatives. So negative is a big hit to wealth. Negative is a short-term disruption to all sorts of productive activity. But - and negative is an increase in debt for an already overly indebted nation.

But then positives - there's this stimulus effect. And you know, we've talked on this show about various debates between Keynesians and non-Keynesians over the benefits of a stimulus. But let's just, for the sake of argument, put that on the positive side of the ledger. So that means lots more construction workers get jobs. You know, lots of new, you know, products are being created to serve that new construction. And then the government gets to make some tough decisions that - some responsible, grown-up fiscal decisions that they've been avoiding for decades. Is it possible to do the math and come out with this as a net economic positive for Japan?

ALEXANDER: In terms of GDP and production flows, I think you might be able to say that, except for the loss of wealth. You could have been using that same money, those same resources, for doing other things, rather than rebuilding. So I think that you could say, and possibly over the course of the next year or two, we will see some strong, positive benefits, including the construction of new highways, new railroads, new cellphone towers and telecommunications networks, new housing for people to replace the old stock. And so we could end up with a more modern, more productive, more efficient amount of capital out there than we have at the moment.

DAVIDSON: Throughout putting this podcast together, I just - I really just couldn't get Haiti out of my mind. You just can't imagine anyone talking about Haiti and using words like resilience. I think this is just another example of how different the world is if you're in a poor nation than a rich nation. A friend of mine was talking about, in Chad - how he was riding on roads that were destroyed decades earlier by some natural disaster, and they're still completely destroyed. So I don't think anyone's talking about silver linings right now. But it is a bit of a blessing that Japan seems to be able to get over this crisis much, much, much more quickly than other countries would.

Hello and welcome to Planet Money.

And my wife says, you're not going to be able to go
sleep after this, and it's utterly horrifying.
And yet we step back away from that and go through
the numbers, and we add it all up.
And when you add it up, he says it looks like this
is unlikely to be a long-term economic
problem for Japan.
He says this is actually the case with advanced
economies.
You can have an earthquake that shifts your
nation by eight feet, and the economy will
barely register it.
One of the great things about modern economies
is they have tremendous redundancy, resilience,
robustness to these sorts of things.
And you can often quickly figure out ways to work
around the disruptions that you do confront.
I think the afflicted parts of the country are
really pretty small part of the total nation,
the total economy.
The most hard-hit prefecture, equivalent to an
American state, is under 2 percent, something like
1.5 percent of the total output of the
country, the same as the population.
So it's a small percentage of the total, and
the robustness of the economy and the
redundancies means that it takes days to weeks,
usually, to reconfigure your production networks
and where you do things to work around the
problems.
Is this on purpose when you say a modern
economy?
And what you mean is a rich, industrialized
nation.
We saw in Haiti, obviously, that Haiti did
not have these redundant systems.
It did not have this resilience, and it's
GDP was hit severely.
And still is hit.
And still is hit, yeah.
They had really one or two functioning ports,
both of which were severely damaged.
They had one real international airport that
was severely damaged.
I mean, in other words, we're not talking
about poor nations.
We're talking about Japan, Europe, the United
States, Canada.
That's right.
When we talk about resilience in a modern
country.
That's right.
I think that sums it up.
We're not Haiti.
Japan is not Haiti.
It has these networks, these redundancies,
these multiple facilities.
And it's not planned.
It's just the way things have developed.
We have both business decisions and some
political decisions to put in multiple systems
that really have this tremendous robustness
in the face of damage.
And you couldn't plan it better,
but it happened kind of automatically.
Alexander told us this interesting story
about the Allies during World War II.
We're trying to figure out what can we bomb
inside Nazi Germany, obviously a big industrialized nation,
that will disrupt their economy.
Is there something we can bomb that'll
just mess everything up?
And they thought, and they thought.
And then they said, oh, we have it.
Ball bearings.
You need ball bearings.
We'll take out the ball bearing factories.
And that was actually interesting for me
to hear because my grandfather worked in the ball bearings
industry during World War II in Worcester, Massachusetts.
And to this day, he will proudly
say you can't fight a world war without ball bearings.
But even though we bombed Nazi ball bearing factories,
they very quickly worked out other ways
to get ball bearings, other ways to make ball bearings.
And it just didn't have a major economic impact.
And Arthur Alexander says, we see this again and again,
at least with modern industrialized nations.
They're disrupted by war, by natural disaster.
And they just get over it remarkably quickly.
He went through the history in Japan.
It has an awful history with earthquakes.
In the 1923 earthquake and a fire in Tokyo
killed 142,000 people.
The physical damage was something like a third
of the country's entire GDP.
In 1995, there was the massive Kobe earthquake,
which hit a major industrial area.
Kobe is something like the third largest
port in the country.
And it served both national shipping
and it was a great international port.
They had 35 containerized berths.
They were all knocked out of commission.
And the highways that we saw,
there were the toppled freeway overspans
that just came down.
The railroads were twisted messes.
Now it turns out further inland,
there were other networks,
transportation networks that survived.
And so a lot of the traffic was simply shifted over
to those other arteries.
This is the redundancy that if one line goes down,
there are other lines to take up the slack.
And so production rapidly recovered.
You sent me this amazing chart showing GDP
around the time of the Kobe earthquake.
And the title was Spot the Quake.
Right.
You can't see it there.
You can't see it.
This is the amazing thing.
Even looking back at 1923,
when the damage relatively speaking was much greater,
that year is kind of lost in the noise
of the ups and downs.
And this is why I say that the current event,
the current disaster,
you won't be able to see very much of it.
And I would think that a few years from now looking back,
again, you may have some problems
picking it out of the noise.
There's a bunch of reasons why a disaster like this
doesn't really show up in the economic data.
So the main economic data that people use
is GDP, gross domestic product,
which is a measure of all the economic activity
in a given year.
When something of value is destroyed,
that doesn't necessarily show up in GDP.
If there's a bridge that was built 10 years ago,
and it's still really valuable,
people use it all the time,
but it wasn't built this year,
then it doesn't show up in this year's GDP.
And if it gets destroyed,
they don't then take that out of GDP
in the year it gets destroyed.
They don't take out the destruction of any assets.
I saw this when I was doing economic stories
on Katrina in New Orleans.
Katrina destroyed an awful lot in New Orleans
and Gulfport and throughout that region,
but it didn't have a sizable impact on measurable GDP.
In some cases, disasters like this
can be positive for GDP.
Japan right now is gonna have to rebuild, right?
And when you rebuild, you have to hire workers
and build houses and new roads,
and that's gonna add to GDP.
The estimates are that repairing the damage
is gonna cost $100 billion,
maybe hundreds of billions of dollars.
Here's Arthur Alexander again.
The rebuilding itself is investment
and it will create a lot of economic activity to do that.
The construction industry in particular,
which has been hard hit for the last 10 years,
will benefit greatly from this,
but that will also create income, profit.
There are gonna be workers out there doing that.
It'll be like the stimulus program
in the United States during the recession.
It will create the jobs, the income,
the consumption that will percolate
through to the rest of the economy.
So that will also add to GDP.
So that's one benefit in a way.
The other side of that is how do you pay for it?
Japan has a huge debt.
It's bigger than ours by a lot, right?
Relative to the size of our economy.
Right, so no matter how you slice it, it's big.
And paying for the recovery operations
is going to require raising money somehow,
either through debt or through increasing taxes.
And Japanese government has been talking
about increasing taxes for the last 10 years.
It never seemed to be the right time.
This looks to be an ideal political time
to go ahead and do something
they should have been doing anyway.
So obviously the key thing right now
is the immediate loss of life, the immediate suffering.
And there's no putting a pretty face on that.
That is awful.
But looking at it economically,
as that's our part of the story at Planet Money,
it sounds like, and I almost hate to use this word,
but it sounds like there are positives and negatives.
So negative is a big hit to wealth.
Negative is a short-term disruption
to all sorts of productive activity.
But a negative is an increase in debt
for an already overly indebted nation.
But then positives, there's this stimulus effect.
And we've talked on this show about various debates
between Keynesians and non-Keynesians
over the benefits of a stimulus.
But let's just, for the sake of argument,
put that on the positive side of the ledger.
So that means lots more construction workers get jobs,
lots of new products are being created
to serve that new construction.
And then the government gets to make
some tough decisions that,
some responsible grown-up fiscal decisions
that they've been avoiding for decades.
Is it possible to do the math
and come out with this as a net economic positive
for Japan?
In terms of GDP and production flows,
I think you might be able to say that,
except for the loss of wealth.
You could have been using that same money,
those same resources for doing other things
rather than rebuilding.
So I think that you could say,
and possibly over the course of the next year or two,
we will see some strong positive benefits,
including the construction of new highways,
new railroads, new cell phone towers
and telecommunications networks,
new housing for people to replace the old stock.
And so we could end up with more modern,
more productive, more efficient amount of capital
out there than we have at the moment.
Throughout putting this podcast together,
I really just couldn't get Haiti out of my mind.
You just can't imagine anyone talking about Haiti
and using words like resilience.
I think this is just another example
of how different the world is
if you're in a poor nation than a rich nation.
A friend of mine was talking about in Chad,
how he was riding on roads that were destroyed
decades earlier by some natural disaster,
and they're still completely destroyed.
So I don't think anyone's talking about
the silver linings right now,
but it is a bit of a blessing
that Japan seems to be able to get over this crisis
much, much, much more quickly than other countries would.

And the three of us are gonna talk about life in Haiti.
David, are you coming?
Yeah.
Excellent.
