On today's Planet Money, we read the thing you've never read: your credit card agreement. And we pose the question: Does it really have to be so long and complicated? We talk to a lawyer who says yes, it really does have to be so long and complicated. We talk to a consultant whose job is to make it simpler. And we ask 4th graders to read a credit-card agreement and tell us what they think.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today is Friday, March 18. That was Mike Froman, White House economics adviser, you heard at the top talking about President Obama's upcoming trip to Latin America. Today on the show, we read that thing you've never read. I'm not talking about the Constitution, not Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History Of Time." I'm talking about your credit card agreement. And we ask the question - why, oh, why, oh, why does it have to be written that way?

JOFFE-WALT: But first, our PLANET MONEY indicator from J.J. Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - seven. Seven world powers just got together and decided to help Japan in, really, a big way. Today, at Japan's request, leaders from the U.S. and Canada and a bunch of European countries, they all started selling yen on the open market. And that, in turn, is actually a very good thing for Japan.

JOFFE-WALT: Ever since the earthquake, the yen had actually been getting stronger and stronger. And as we've pointed out before, somewhat confusingly, a stronger currency for a country can actually be bad for that country's economy because when your currency gets stronger, the stuff that you make in your country and you try to sell becomes more expensive to countries abroad. So if you're, say, you know, Honda or Sony or any other Japanese exporter, a stronger yen is bad for your business. And Japan's economy really depends on exports.

KESTENBAUM: Jacob, is it right to think of this as sort of a backdoor version of foreign aid? I mean, it helps Japan - right? - 'cause it makes their exports cheaper, but it makes our exports in Japan more expensive. So is this something that hurts all of us a little bit and it helps Japan?

GOLDSTEIN: Well, you know, I talked this morning to this guy Jeffrey Frankel. He's an economist at Harvard who looks at this stuff. And he basically said there are two reasons he thinks that all these countries got together and agreed to do this. And one is basically just solidarity, and so that one does sort of feel like foreign aid, right? Like, Japan is in this horrible spot right now, and we are going to stand with them and give them what they want. The other one is sort of less like foreign aid. He basically said, you know, a lot of economists basically think you should let currency markets do what they want. If the yen's getting stronger, let it get stronger, except in times when it's sort of going crazy and when there's a lot of volatility. And he was saying what we've been seeing in the last few days may qualify for that. So in that case, there is some notion that we're really acting in our self-interest to try and sort of settle the market down a little bit.

KESTENBAUM: I see - that we're not artificially setting the price at the end but that we're just trying to keep it sort of stable for them in this difficult time.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, which is, of course, a judgment call and a fine line. But he basically said, yeah, this looks like a good call, and it looks like it'll probably work; it looks like, you know, the yen has gotten a little weaker, and at least so far today, it's pretty stable. So that's good for Japan.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so on to that document that no one reads, right, David?

KESTENBAUM: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: So we've all received credit card agreements. I have one right here. It's the legal notice that you get with your credit card, and it'll say many things. For instance - I'm just going to read from the top - (reading) we may add this fee for the first time your payment is returned even if it is not returned upon resubmission. The fee will be $25 or $35 with any additional returned payment in the next six billing cycles after the return...

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) OK, OK, OK.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So sounds familiar. Today we're going to meet a person who looks at this thing that I'm holding in my hand and believes it is a masterpiece.

KESTENBAUM: And we're going to meet someone who thinks it is not a masterpiece. We're talking about this today because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - that thing just created by Congress - has made it clear it wants to put an end to this. It wants to translate this fine print into English for the rest of us. It wants to make this stuff readable so we will all know exactly what we're getting into when we sign up for a credit card or take out a loan or sign up for a bank account. First question, though - where do documents like this come from anyway?

JOFFE-WALT: What's your relationship with that paperwork?

ROBERTA TORIAN: I write a lot of it (laughter). I started writing credit card agreements almost right out of law school, you know, like, over 25 years ago.

KESTENBAUM: Chana, you found the author? You know, when reading these things, I never thought about, like, who is the person who wrote this? I guess I thought it was written by a machine or something. What does she look like?

JOFFE-WALT: Neat (laughter). She looks very neat. She's sort of impeccably dressed. Great posture. Her name is Roberta Torian, and she's a lawyer for Reed Smith in Philadelphia. And I met Roberta in her office. She has a file cabinet of her works, and she sort of sifts through them for me. She grabs a department store credit card agreement and holds it four feet above the ground and allows it to unfold all the way to the floor.

Does it seem like every single thing on here is absolutely necessary to include?

TORIAN: Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah. I don't - yeah, I don't see anything in here that we really could eliminate.

JOFFE-WALT: If you got this - or when you do apply for credit cards, do you sit and read the entire thing?

TORIAN: Of course I do (laughter).

KESTENBAUM: I really thought that pause, she was going to give you the, no, I don't read it either.

JOFFE-WALT: I know. I did, too (laughter). This is what I really liked about Roberta, is that she lives in a totally alternate universe from - at least from the one that I know. In my universe, you know, people look at an agreement like this and they say, there's no way that can all be necessary. But in the world Roberta lives in, it is sincerely, exactly the opposite. It makes perfect sense. She's sort of incredulous about my entire line of questioning - you know, like, my sort of simple, why can't you just put all this on one page? And she, like, laughed at me. She said, there's no way to fit everything that you have to say on one page; that's a crazy question. Well, OK, why is this part in eight-point font? She says if it wasn't in eight-point font, it would have to be even longer.

OK, why can't it be written in plain English then?

TORIAN: Well, I had this discussion actually with a client last week (laughter) because I was writing an agreement over the weekend. Indeed, the client said, well, you know, I'd rather not have too much legalese. And I said fine, then it's going to be longer. And she said, are you kidding me? And I said no. I said because there are terms such as - let me give you a quick example - herein - as set forth herein. If I'm not going to use herein, I have to say as set forth in this agreement. So I now have three words where I had one. And if I don't say heretofore, then we have to say as we stated above, you know, in Section so-and-so, or as we stated earlier in this paragraph, rather than as stated heretofore.

KESTENBAUM: All right. So writing in plain English takes a couple more words than saying pursuant to or whatever. It seems worth it to me. I mean, why don't they do it?

JOFFE-WALT: Well, Roberta says it's written in legal language because it needs to be legal. The majority of your credit card agreement is there because, by law, it has to be. And not only that, but every decade or so Congress demands that our credit card companies or our banks tell us more. They pass a new law, which means Roberta has to add to that document. She has to write more. She has to write what happens if you lose your credit card. How quickly can you access your money? She has to write, what are the different kinds of accounts you can have? How do the terms differ if you're in New Jersey or Nebraska? And what about online banking? She says, if I don't say you have to pay us back, you don't have to pay us back.

TORIAN: When you have a contract that says you have to pay me back and you don't pay it back, then it's a lot simpler to try to get a judgment against somebody because the facts are there. But if you never said you have to pay me back, then you have to sue, and the person can say it was a gift.

JOFFE-WALT: Roberta tells me that when she goes to parties, she doesn't tell people what she does. It just gets too emotional. Because people are always convinced that banks are trying to hide things. They're burying fees somewhere in there. And I asked Roberta if she had ever been asked by a bank to bury something or make some phrasing kind of hard to understand. And she said no. In her view, that does not happen.

TORIAN: I know that bank lawyers generally tell banks, you know, you should highlight this. You should underline this. You should use italics for this to call attention to it. So banks - because they're regulated, they're not trying to hide anything. What you want is for your customers to know how their accounts work so that if something happens, they're not surprised. It keeps down customer complaints. That's what you want. You want a customer satisfaction rate of, like, 95% if you can get it.

JOFFE-WALT: In Roberta Torian's universe, the people who are failing here are the consumers - the people who get these documents and do not read them. She says she is always hearing stories about people who are complaining to the government regulators of banks, saying my bank changed my fee on me, and they didn't tell me, or if they did, it was probably in some insert in my envelope. And then they say her least favorite words.

TORIAN: But who reads that stuff anyway?

JOFFE-WALT: For Roberta, this is her work. She spends hours and hours writing these documents, and they are documents that she thinks are meant to be read.

Does it hurt you a little bit to hear who reads that anyway?

TORIAN: I think probably a few years ago it was a little disturbing. Because the lawyers who write it are so meticulous. The bank will send a notice, but then people don't read the - you know, they don't read the inserts and the statements. And the rate goes up, and they're very concerned about it. So I guess somebody needs to come up with a way to make people read their statements. I mean, I don't know what that way is. I mean, we - you really can't force people to read anything.

KESTENBAUM: You can't? Or can you. Dun dun dun dun da (ph).

JOFFE-WALT: What are we looking at here?

SUSAN KLEIMAN: So...

JOFFE-WALT: This whole table.

KLEIMAN: Well, what I've spread out on this table is the various versions that we went through as we went out and tested with consumers.

KESTENBAUM: This is Susan Kleiman. You can think about her as the anti-Roberta. Roberta works for banks, not the consumer. Susan is the opposite. She thinks about these documents from the consumer's perspective. She's the sort of person the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would probably hire to simplify bank documents - the documents that Roberta writes.

JOFFE-WALT: Roberta definitely thinks all the pages in these credit agreements and bank documents - they're all there to help consumers. Susan, though, says that's not always the case.

KLEIMAN: Sometimes you're hiding choice. Sometimes you're hiding letting people know what the real information is.

JOFFE-WALT: Susan says most of the stuff people like Roberta write - financial documents - they have a basic problem. They're contracts. They're written for protection - to protect the banks definitely and maybe the consumer, too. But the thought sitting in the minds of writers like Roberta is always protection. And Susan says that's a problem.

KLEIMAN: When you're writing protectively as opposed to informatively, you end up with some pretty bad documents. I think as soon as you get into some of the legalistic language - yeah, heretofore - I actually like the word notwithstanding, but it's not a great one to put into a document for a consumer. All the little roman numerals - you know, if something looks difficult, people assume that it is difficult. And they won't read it.

JOFFE-WALT: Most people who write credit card documents know a lot about credit. Susan says people like Roberta - they want to tell you everything they know in these documents. It's sort of like your uncle who loves to talk and talk and talk and - but he never actually stops to see if you care what he's saying or if you have any thoughts to add.

KESTENBAUM: Susan says every day she reads a document you can tell was written by someone who never imagined themselves as the reader. Like, there was one government form that had a question on it that put Susan in a bad mood for weeks.

KLEIMAN: And one of the questions on that is, do you belong to a terrorist group? Who would say yes? What's the point of that question?

KESTENBAUM: Susan says this is the problem a lot of the time. When people write these kinds of documents, they don't think about who is reading them. And she says there is a way to write these things in a clear, simple way.

JOFFE-WALT: So she has a process to figure out what a clear, simple way would be that people would understand. And basically, she gets focus groups together, and she has them read documents and react. So this one time, she was assigned to simplify a bank privacy disclosure. The banks had been sending out these disclosures saying that they could share people's personal information and that people had an option to opt out if they wanted to. They had a choice. But nobody understood that from the forms. It was totally unclear. So Susan was assigned to make these forms clear enough that people knew that they had this choice and they could opt for it if they wanted to.

KLEIMAN: So we did focus groups. And one of the first things we heard is that when you say financial privacy notice, consumers immediately assumed there wasn't anything they could do. It was kind of, here's our privacy notice, our privacy policy. And take it or leave it. We're just informing you. There's no choice in here. There's nothing you can do.

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, so from the very beginning, like, what the document is actually just called...

KLEIMAN: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Wasn't working for people.

KLEIMAN: Yes. Yes. And I don't think any of us - we, as designers, didn't anticipate that. And it was just crystal clear.

KESTENBAUM: So Susan decided they needed to change the name. They were no longer financial privacy notices. Susan played with a lot of different titles to try and get people to read them.

JOFFE-WALT: And she showed me a sort of Version 1, Version 2, Version 3, all laid out in front of us.

KLEIMAN: So all this was was experimenting.

JOFFE-WALT: And what worked?

KLEIMAN: None of these.

JOFFE-WALT: None of them worked?

KLEIMAN: None of these. And we had this other option that we tried to do, a much more graphical presentation so it would look more inviting. These didn't work either.

KESTENBAUM: And then Susan had a new idea. Let's just try the most basic structure you can think of for communicating information. Break it down into who, why, what, when, how - you know, the way you would do in, like, 4th grade. Susan says she actually wrote those words on the form - who, what, why, where, when, how.

JOFFE-WALT: And I should say, fourth grade is not totally an arbitrary grade. Fourth grade is talked about a lot in these kind of readability studies as, like, a measure. You know, could a fourth-grader understand this?

KESTENBAUM: Right. So on the form they have the who, what, when, where, why. They actually write that down. And next to those words, they put the answers. And then under that, they have a graphic, a table. It's very clear. Column 1 lists all the various ways the bank shares information. Right next to it, it tells you whether that's something you can say yes or no to. And then if you can say yes or no to it, there's option. You get to circle. Yes, it's fine with me. You can share that information. No, it's not fine with me. Don't share it.

KLEIMAN: So then we went to Austin. By this time, the why, what and who - we had narrowed things down. We had a stronger table. This was really working. So my fantasy would be that just about anybody would be able to pick it up and maybe not read every word and understand every word, but would be able to get to this table and would understand that there was an option here and that there was something they might be able to do about that.

JOFFE-WALT: What would happen if you showed this to a fourth-grader?

KLEIMAN: I would guess that they would have trouble with some of the words I would think that they would kind of get the table. I think they would understand the basics of it.

ZJAERIQ SANDERS: Hi. My name is Zjaeriq Sanders, and I am in fourth grade.

KESTENBAUM: Chana, I love that you actually found a fourth-grader.

JOFFE-WALT: We found three fourth-graders. We set out to do our own testing, and we sat down with Zjaeriq Sanders (ph), who you just heard, Neo Johnson (ph) and Jasmine Gomez (ph) from P.S. 51's fourth grade. And their teacher assured us these three - they are average fourth-graders. They're not way ahead of their peers, but they're not way behind either.

KESTENBAUM: So you brought them two documents - the first one, Susan's improved privacy disclosure document - no longer called a privacy disclosure document - and a Macy's credit card agreement.

JOFFE-WALT: And that credit card agreement was very similar to the one that Roberta, the woman who writes credit card agreements - the one that she had shown me in her office. So I sat down with the kids, and I showed them that one first.

What do you guys think just looking at that right away?

NEO JOHNSON: A lot of words.

ZJAERIQ: I think it's probably going to be complicated.

JOFFE-WALT: When I was in Roberta's office and we were sitting, looking at this department store credit card agreement, I had asked her to choose a section to read to me. So she sat down and read me a section.

TORIAN: The finance charge for a billing period is calculated by applying the periodic rate to the account balance subject to finance charge for each day in the billing period and adding together all of those daily finance charge amounts.

JOFFE-WALT: Do you read that and think that's very clear, what that's saying?

TORIAN: Yeah. I mean, I do. I mean, we're saying that this is what we do. You're - you have a billing period. We tell you that the charges are separate depending on the plan. I can see from your face that you don't think it's clear at all (laughter).

JOFFE-WALT: If you were only writing this so that, like, me and a fourth-grader could actually understand it, you would write it differently, right?

TORIAN: If I were writing it for a fourth-grader and knew that the fourth-grader could default, I'd still write it the same way (laughter). There's just - you just can't get around that. I mean, you have to have a document that will give you the ability to get your money back, whether it's a fourth-grader or, you know, somebody 50.

JASMINE GOMEZ: Interest charge balance compation (ph)...

JOFFE-WALT: Computation.

JASMINE: ...Computation method.

ZJAERIQ: An interest charge will be imposed on each balance within each account type that is subject to interest charges by applying a daily periodic rate.

JOFFE-WALT: So David, these kids are taking turns reading. And when Zjaeriq takes over, Neo's eyes kind of wander out the window until they're all finished.

ZJAERIQ: To me, it doesn't explain what a interest charge is clearly, so...

NEO: And with me, I wasn't paying attention. And (laughter) when I heard the middle-to-the-last part, it did not make any sense at all.

JASMINE: I didn't understand what an account type was.

NEO: You should.

ZJAERIQ: We don't really know what all these big words mean yet.

KESTENBAUM: All right. So I think the Macy's credit card agreement fails the fourth-grade test. None of these three kids said they really understood what Macy's was trying to tell them. Next up - Susan's document about banks disclosing personal information.

JOFFE-WALT: Now, I have to say, David, when I was looking at, you know, Susan's various iterations of this privacy document - and she'd spend, like, a half an hour talking about the table and what the table should look like and how they tested it with three groups in three different cities. And I just felt like it can't possibly matter. All these tiny little decisions can't make a huge difference.

But as soon as I handed this document to the fourth-graders, you could tell that every decision about the layout mattered. Because before they even read any words, they were completely engaged in trying to figure it out.

ZJAERIQ: Oh, wait. So I think all financial companies need to share customers' personal information to run their everyday business.

NEO: What?

ZJAERIQ: I think they're telling you, like, why they need your personal information.

JASMINE: It tells you what you're going to know about. Like, why, it says here, what and how. Like, if you had questions like that, it'll, like, answer it for you.

ZJAERIQ: Oh, OK.

NEO: But the federal law...

ZJAERIQ: The second...

NEO: ...Doesn't think...

ZJAERIQ: The second sentence says that the federal law gives you the right to, like, choose how - like, some of the information they want you to share, but not all.

JOFFE-WALT: All three fourth-graders understood that they had a choice, that this document was presenting them with a choice, something having to do with the banks sharing their personal information. And I have to say, it may not be a fair comparison to a billing structure of a credit card with multiple account types, but I do think the privacy form wins our very informal fourth grade readability test.

KESTENBAUM: So who's right - Roberta, the person who writes the legal documents, or Susan, the person who's trying to translate them into English? It seems like, from the fourth-graders, we sort of have an answer.

JOFFE-WALT: Well, here's what I've come away from all of this feeling like. I feel like they can actually both be sort of right.

KESTENBAUM: Oh, that's such a happy little answer.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter) OK. It seems at least like they can each get their own section - right? - of the financial document. So Susan could do, like, the first page or two and make them really simple and really clear. And then Roberta can have the next, and she can put all the legal language that you have to have in there. She can fill 12 pages with heretofores and notwithstanding. And you can have both, you know, the simplicity of understanding all the important points and all the legal language that you have to have.

KESTENBAUM: And you may have noticed this already in some of your credit card documents - there are new regulations that mandate credit card companies show you a first page that is clear, with the most important information laid out.

JOFFE-WALT: Roberta does have a nagging fear about that, though, which is that we're just going to add to the things that are the most important for you to know, and we're going to add to the first page. And then you'll have two pages and three pages of most important things that you need to know in clear, simplified languages, and it will just make it longer and longer and longer.

KESTENBAUM: And then, again, no one reads it.

JOFFE-WALT: Right.

KESTENBAUM: It does seem like we are heading toward at least a couple pages upfront trying to lay stuff out clearly. That is clearly the intent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, now created by the bank reform bill. They hope we'll have easy-to-read financial documents. And Susan the simplifier says that will be great. People will understand their rights and options and obligations.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "WHIP MY HAIR")

WILLOW SMITH: (Singing) I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth. I whip my hair back and forth.

JOFFE-WALT: You can see the bank privacy notice that Susan worked on. You can actually see the before she worked on it and then the after she had simplified it and made it clear and easy to read on our blog - npr.org/money. Also on our blog, you can see a picture of Neo and Zjaeriq, the two fourth-graders, studying a 12-page Macy's credit card agreement.

ZJAERIQ: Oh, wait. So I think - wait, hold on. Can you read that again?

NEO: OK.

JOFFE-WALT: And we want to especially thank their teacher, Mrs. Kawasaki (ph), for letting us pull them from class and spend some time with them.

KESTENBAUM: Please send us your solutions to financial document headaches. You can send us email - planetmoney@npr.org. Or you can reach us on Facebook. I'm David Kestenbaum.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
The overall message is that we view our relationship with the rest of the hemisphere as a critical
one, critical to our economic well-being here, to job creation here.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today is Friday, March 18th.
That was Mike Froman, White House economics advisor you heard at the top, talking about
President Obama's upcoming trip to Latin America.
Today on the show, we read that thing you've never read.
I'm not talking about the Constitution, not Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of
Time.
I'm talking about your credit card agreement.
And we ask the question, why, oh, why, oh, why does it have to be written that
way?
But first, our Planet Money Indicator from J.J. Goldstein.
Today's Planet Money Indicator, seven.
Even world powers just got together and decided to help Japan in really a big way.
Today, at Japan's request, leaders from the U.S. and Canada and a bunch of European
countries, they all started selling yen on the open market.
And that, in turn, is actually a very good thing for Japan.
Ever since the earthquake, the yen had actually been getting stronger and stronger.
And as we've pointed out before, somewhat confusingly, a stronger currency for
a country can actually be bad for that country's economy.
Because when your currency gets stronger, the stuff that you make in your country and
you try to sell becomes more expensive to countries abroad.
So if you're, say, you know, Honda or Sony or any other Japanese exporter, a stronger
yen is bad for your business.
And Japan's economy really depends on exports.
Jacob, is it right to think of this as sort of a backdoor version of foreign aid?
I mean, it helps Japan, right, because it makes their exports cheaper.
But it makes our exports in Japan more expensive.
So is this something that hurts all of us a little bit and it helps Japan?
Well, you know, I talked this morning to this guy, Jeffrey Frankel.
He's an economist at Harvard who looks at this stuff.
And he basically said there are two reasons he thinks that all these countries got
together and agreed to do this.
And one is basically just solidarity.
And so that one does sort of feel like foreign aid, right?
Like Japan is in this horrible spot right now, and we are going to stand with them
and give them what they want.
The other one is sort of less like foreign aid.
He basically said, you know, a lot of economists basically think you should let currency markets
do what they want.
If the yen's getting stronger, let it get stronger, except in times when it's sort
of going crazy and when there's a lot of volatility.
And he was saying what we've been seeing in the last few days may qualify for that.
So in that case, there is some notion that we're really acting in our self-interest
to try and sort of settle the market down a little bit.
I see, that we're not artificially setting the price of the yen, but that we're just
trying to keep it sort of stable for them in this difficult time.
Yes, which is of course a judgment call and a fine line.
But he basically said, yeah, this looks like a good call, and it looks like it'll
probably work.
It looks like, you know, the yen has gotten a little weaker, and at least so far today,
it's pretty stable.
So that's good for Japan.
OK, thank you, Jacob.
Thanks, guys.
OK, so on to that document that no one reads, right, David?
Yes.
So we've all received credit card agreements.
I have one right here.
It's the legal notice that you get with your credit card, and it'll say many
things.
For instance, I'm just going to read from the top.
We may add this fee for the first time your payment is returned.
Even if it is not returned upon resubmission, the fee will be $25 or $35 with any additional
returned payment in the next six billing cycles after the return.
OK.
OK.
OK.
OK.
So sounds familiar.
Today we're going to meet a person who looks at this thing that I'm holding in
my hand and believes it is a masterpiece.
And we're going to meet someone who thinks it is not a masterpiece.
We're talking about this today because the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that
thing just created by Congress, has made it clear it wants to put an end to this.
It wants to translate this fine print into English for the rest of us.
It wants to make this stuff readable.
So we will all know exactly what we're getting into when we sign up for a credit
card or take out a loan or sign up for a bank account.
First question, though.
Where do documents like this come from anyway?
What's your relationship with that paperwork?
I write a lot of it.
I started writing credit card agreements almost right out of law school, you know,
like over 25 years ago.
Hanna, you found the author.
You know, when reading these things, I never thought about, like, who is the person
who wrote this.
I guess I thought it was written by a machine or something.
What does she look like?
Neat.
She looks very neat.
She's sort of impeccably dressed, great posture.
Her name is Roberta Torian and she's a lawyer for Reed Smith in
Philadelphia.
And I met Roberta in her office.
She has a file cabinet of her works and she sort of sifts through them for me.
She grabs a department store credit card agreement and holds it four feet
above the ground and allows it to unfold all the way to the floor.
Does it seem like every single thing on here is absolutely necessary to include?
Absolutely.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't, yeah.
I don't see, I don't see anything in here that we really could eliminate.
If you got this, or when you do, when you do apply for credit cards, do you
sit and read the entire thing?
Of course I do.
I really thought that pause, she was going to give you the, no, I don't read it either.
I know, I did too.
So this is what I really liked about Roberta is that she lives in a totally
alternate universe from, at least from the one that I know.
In my universe, you know, people look at an agreement like this and they say,
there's no way that can all be necessary.
But in the world Roberta lives in, it is sincerely exactly the opposite.
It makes perfect sense.
She's sort of incredulous about my entire line of questioning.
You know, like my sort of simple, why can't you just put all this on one page?
And she like laughed at me, she said, there's no way to fit everything that
you have to say on one page, it's a crazy question.
Well, okay, why is this part an eight point font?
She says, if it wasn't an eight point font, it'd have to be even longer.
Okay, why can't it be written in plain English then?
Well, I had this discussion actually with a client last week because I was writing
an agreement over the weekend and the client said, well, you know, I'd rather
not have too much legal leads.
And I said, fine, then it's going to be longer.
And she said, are you kidding me?
And I said, no.
I said, because there are terms such as, let me give you a quick example, herein.
As set forth herein, if I'm not going to use herein, I have to say,
as set forth in this agreement.
So I now have three words where I had one.
And if I don't say here to for, then we have to say, as we stated above,
in section so and so, or as we stated earlier in this paragraph,
rather than as stated here to for.
All right, so writing in plain English takes a couple more words than saying
pursuant to or whatever.
It seems worth it to me.
I mean, why don't they do it?
Well, Roberta says it's written in legal language because it needs to be
legal. The majority of your credit card agreement is there because by law,
it has to be.
And not only that, but every decade or so, Congress demands that our credit
card companies or our banks tell us more.
They pass a new law, which means Roberta has to add to that document.
She has to write more. She has to write, what happens if you lose your
credit card? How quickly can you access your money?
She has to write, what are the different kinds of accounts you can have?
How do the terms differ if you're in New Jersey or Nebraska?
And what about online banking?
She says, if I don't say you have to pay us back, you don't have to pay us back.
When you have a contract that says you have to pay me back and you don't
pay it back, then it's a lot simpler to try to get a judgment against somebody
because the facts are there.
But if you never said you have to pay me back, then you have to sue and the
person can say it was a gift.
Roberta tells me that when she goes to parties, she doesn't tell people
what she does. It just gets too emotional because people are always
convinced that banks are trying to hide things.
They're burying fees somewhere in there.
And I asked Roberta if she had ever been asked by a bank to bury
something or make some phrasing kind of hard to understand.
And she said no. In her view, that does not happen.
I know that bank lawyers generally tell banks, you know, you should
highlight this. You should underline this.
You should use italics for this to call attention to it.
So banks, because they're regulated, they're not trying to hide anything.
What you want is for your customers to know how their accounts work so
that if something happens, they're not surprised.
It keeps down customer complaints. That's what you want.
You want a customer satisfaction rate of like 95 percent if you can get it.
In Roberta Torian's universe, the people who are failing here are the
consumers, the people who get these documents and do not read them.
She says she is always hearing stories about people who are
complaining to the government regulators of banks saying my bank
changed my fee on me and they didn't tell me.
Or if they did, it was probably in some insert in my envelope.
And then they say her least favorite words.
But who reads that stuff anyway?
For Roberta, this is her work.
She spends hours and hours writing these documents.
And they are documents that she thinks are meant to be read.
Does it hurt you a little bit to hear who reads that anyway?
I think probably a few years ago it was it was a little disturbing
because the lawyers who write it are so meticulous.
The bank will send a notice, but then people don't read, you know,
they don't read the inserts in the statements that the rate goes up
and they're very concerned about it.
So I guess somebody needs to come up with a way to make people read
their statements. I don't know what that way is.
I mean, we you really can't force people to read anything.
You can't or can you?
What are we looking at here, this whole table?
Well, what I've spread out on this table is the the various versions
that we went through as we went out and tested with consumers.
This is Susan Kleiman.
You can think about her as the anti-Roberta.
Roberta works for banks, not the consumer.
Susan is the opposite.
She thinks about these documents from the consumer's perspective.
She's the sort of person the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
would probably hire to simplify bank documents,
the documents that Roberta writes.
Roberta definitely thinks all the pages in these credit agreements
and bank documents, they're all there to help consumers.
Susan, though, says that's not always the case.
Sometimes you're hiding choice.
Sometimes you're hiding letting people know what the real information is.
Susan says most of the stuff people like Roberta write,
financial documents, they have a basic problem.
They're contracts.
They're written for protection.
To protect the banks, definitely, and maybe the consumer, too.
But the thought sitting in the minds of writers like Roberta
is always protection.
And Susan says that's a problem.
When you're writing protectively as opposed to informatively,
you end up with some pretty bad documents.
I think as soon as you get into some of the legalistic language,
yeah, heretofore.
I actually like the word notwithstanding,
but it's not a great one to put into a document for a consumer.
All the little Roman numerals.
If something looks difficult, people assume that it is difficult,
and they won't read it.
Most people who write credit card documents
know a lot about credit.
Susan says people like Roberta,
they want to tell you everything they know in these documents.
It's sort of like your uncle who loves to talk and talk and talk,
but he never actually stops to see if you care what he's saying
or if you have any thoughts to add.
Susan says every day she reads a document you can tell
was written by someone who never imagined themselves as the reader.
Like, there was one government forum that had a question on it
that put Susan in a bad mood for weeks.
And one of the questions on that is,
do you belong to a terrorist group?
Who would say yes?
What's the point of that question?
Susan says this is the problem a lot of the time.
When people write these kinds of documents,
they don't think about who is reading them.
She says there is a way to write these things in a clear, simple way.
So she has a process to figure out what a clear, simple way would be
that people would understand.
And basically, she gets focus groups together,
and she has them read documents and react.
So this one time she was assigned to simplify a bank privacy disclosure.
The banks had been sending out these disclosures
saying that they could share people's personal information
and that people had an option to opt out if they wanted to.
They had a choice, but nobody understood that from the forums.
It was totally unclear.
So Susan was assigned to make these forums clear enough
that people knew that they had this choice
and they could opt for it if they wanted to.
So we did focus groups.
And one of the first things we heard
is that when you say financial privacy notice,
consumers immediately assumed there wasn't anything they could do.
It was kind of, here's our privacy notice, our privacy policy,
and take it or leave it.
We're just informing you.
There's no choice in here.
There's nothing you can do.
Oh, so from the very beginning, like what the document
has actually just called wasn't working for people.
Yes.
And I don't think any of us, we as designers didn't anticipate that.
And it was just crystal clear.
So Susan decided they needed to change the name.
They were no longer financial privacy notices.
Susan played with a lot of different titles
to try and get people to read them.
And she showed me sort of version one, version two, version three,
all laid out in front of us.
So all this was was experimenting.
And what worked?
None of these.
None of them worked?
None of these.
And we had this other option that we tried
to do a much more graphical presentation
so it would look more inviting.
These didn't work either.
And then Susan had a new idea.
Let's just try the most basic structure
you can think of for communicating information.
Break it down into who, why, what, when, how.
The way you would do in fourth grade.
Susan says she actually wrote those words on the form.
Who, what, why, where, when, how.
I should say fourth grade is not totally an arbitrary grade.
Fourth grade is talked about a lot
in these kind of readability studies as a measure.
Could a fourth grader understand this?
So on the form they have the who, what, when, where, why.
They actually write that down.
And next to those words, they put the answers.
And then under that, they have a graphic, a table.
It's very clear.
Column one lists all the various ways
the bank shares information.
Right next to it, it tells you
whether that's something you can say yes or no to.
And then if you can say yes or no to it, there's an option.
You get to circle.
Yes, it's fine with me.
You can share that information.
No, it's not fine with me.
Don't share it.
So then we went to Austin.
By this time, the why, what, and who,
we had narrowed things down.
We had a stronger table.
This was really working.
So my fantasy would be that just about anybody
would be able to pick it up
and maybe not read every word and understand every word
but would be able to get to this table
and would understand that there was an option here
and that there was something
they might be able to do about that.
What would happen if you showed this to a fourth grader?
I would guess that they would have trouble
with some of the words.
I would think that they would kind of get the table.
I think they would understand the basics of it.
Hi, my name is Jarek Sanders and I am in fourth grade.
Han, I love that you actually found a fourth grader.
We found three fourth graders.
We set out to do our own testing
and we sat down with Jarek Sanders,
who you just heard, Neo Johnson, and Jasmine Gomez
from PS51's fourth grade.
And their teacher assured us these three,
they are average fourth graders.
They're not way ahead of their peers
but they're not way behind either.
So you brought them two documents.
First one, Susan's improved privacy disclosure document,
no longer called a privacy disclosure document,
and a Macy's credit card agreement.
And that credit card agreement was very similar
to the one that Roberta,
the woman who writes credit card agreements,
the one that she had shown me in her office.
So I sat down with the kids
and I showed them that one first.
What do you guys think just looking at that right away?
A lot of words.
I think it's probably gonna be complicated.
When I was in Roberta's office
and we were sitting looking at this department store
credit card agreement,
I had asked her to choose a section to read to me.
So she sat down and read me a section.
The financial charge for a billing period
is calculated by applying the periodic rate
to the account balance subject to financial charge
for each day in the billing period
and adding together all of those
daily financial charge amounts.
Do you read that and think that's very clear
what that's saying?
Yeah, I mean, I do.
I mean, we're saying that this is what we do.
You have a billing period.
We tell you that the charges are separate
depending on the plan.
I can see from your face
that you don't think it's clear at all.
If you were only writing this
so that like me and a fourth grader
could actually understand it,
you'd write it differently, right?
If I were writing it for a fourth grader
and knew that the fourth grader could default,
I'd still write it the same way.
You just can't get around that.
I mean, you have to have a document
that will give you the ability to get your money back
whether it's a fourth grader or, you know, somebody 50.
Interest charge balance computation.
Computation.
Computation method.
An interest charge will be imposed
on each balance within each account type
that is subject to interest charges
by applying a daily periodic rate.
So David, these kids are taking turns reading
and when Jarek takes over,
Neo's eyes kind of wander out the window
until they're all finished.
To me, it doesn't explain
what a interest charge is clearly, so.
And with me, I wasn't paying attention
and when I heard the middle to the last part,
it did not make any sense at all.
I didn't understand what an account type was.
We don't really know what all these big words mean yet.
All right, so I think the Macy's credit card agreement
fails the fourth grade test.
None of these three kids said they really understood
what Macy's was trying to tell them.
Next up, Susan's document
about banks disclosing personal information.
Now, I have to say, David,
when I was looking at, you know,
Susan's various iterations of this privacy document
and she spent like half an hour
talking about the table
and what the table should look like
and how they tested it with three groups
in three different cities.
And I just felt like it can't possibly matter.
All these tiny little decisions
can't make a huge difference.
But as soon as I handed this document
to the fourth graders,
you could tell that every decision
about the layout mattered
because before they even read any words,
they were completely engaged
and trying to figure it out.
Oh, wait, so I think all financial companies
need to share customers' personal
information to run their everyday business.
I think they're telling you, like,
why they need the personal information.
It tells you what you're gonna know about,
like why it says here, what and how.
Like, if you had questions like that,
it would like answer it for you.
Oh, okay.
But the federal law does something.
The second sentence says
that the federal law gives you the right
to choose how, like, some of the information
they want you to share, but not all.
All three fourth graders understood
that they had a choice,
that this document was presenting them
with a choice, something having to do
with the banks sharing their personal information.
And I have to say,
it might be a fair comparison
to a billing structure of a credit card
with multiple account types,
but I do think the privacy form wins
our very informal fourth grade readability test.
So who's right, Roberta, the person
who writes the legal documents,
or Susan, the person who's trying
to translate them into English?
It seems like from the fourth graders,
we sort of have an answer.
Well, here's what I've come away
from all of this feeling like.
I feel like they can actually both be sort of right.
Oh, that's such a happy little answer.
It seems at least like they can each
get their own section, right,
of the financial document.
So Susan could do the first page or two
and make them really simple and really clear.
And then Roberta can have the next,
and she can put all the legal language
that you have to have in there.
She can fill 12 pages with here two fours
and notwithstanding.
And you can have both the simplicity
of understanding all the important points
and all the legal language that you have to have.
And you may have noticed this already
in some of your credit card documents.
There are new regulations that mandate
credit card companies show you a first page
that is clear with the most important information laid out.
Roberta does have a nagging fear about that though,
which is that we're just gonna add
to the things that are the most important
for you to know.
And we're gonna add to the first page
and then you'll have two pages
and three pages of most important things
that you need to know in clear,
simplified languages and it will just make it longer
and longer and longer.
And then again, no one reads it.
Right.
It does seem like we're heading toward
at least a couple pages upfront,
trying to lay stuff out clearly.
That is clearly the intent
of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
now created by the Bank Reform Bill.
They hope we'll have easy to read financial documents
and Susan, the simplifier says that will be great.
People will understand their rights
and options and obligations.
You can see the bank privacy notice
that Susan worked on.
You can actually see the before she worked on it
and then the after she had simplified it
and made it clear and easy to read on our blog,
npr.org slash money.
Also on our blog,
you can see a picture of Neo and Jarek,
the two of them together in one page.
And then you can see the first page
that is clear with the most important information laid out.
And then you can see the second page
that is clear with the most important information laid out.
The two fourth graders
studying a 12 page Macy's credit card agreement.
Oh, wait.
So I think, wait, hold on.
Can you read that again?
Okay.
And we wanna especially thank their teacher,
Mrs. Kawasaki, for letting us pull them from class
and spend some time with them.
