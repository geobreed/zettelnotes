It's Fannie and Freddie week on Planet Money!

They're two of the strangest companies in U.S. history — and their bailouts cost taxpayers more than the bailouts of AIG, GM, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs combined.

On today's Podcast, we tell the story of the rise and fall of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

On Friday's podcast, we ask: What does it mean for taxpayers to own Fannie and Freddie? And where do we go from here?

For more: Read our series on Fannie and Freddie: Part one, "Kill Them, Bury Them," part two, "Self-Fulfilling Prophecy," and part three, "What's Next."

In other news: From Baldur, Planet Money's intern:

    I'm facing an economic dilemma, and I want your advice.

    I'm from Iceland. On April 9th, my country is holding a referendum to decide whether to pay back the $5 billion one of our bankrupt banks owes to the Netherlands and the U.K.

    How should I vote?

Governments are not very good at doing them, not very good at designing them, not very good at pricing them, not very good at - of limiting the moral hazard risk that comes with them. As we saw in this crisis, when you make those mistakes, you can leave the taxpayers with huge, huge losses and...

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today's Tuesday, March 29. And that was Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner you heard at the top. He was testifying before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month. Today on the show, we'll explore what has turned out to be the most costly bailout of the financial crisis, more expensive for taxpayers than AIG, GM, Citigroup, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs combined. I'm talking about the bailout of the two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

BLUMBERG: American taxpayers have so far put $130 billion into rescuing the companies. That number could rise to over 300 billion in the next couple of years. And this week, Jacob, is Fannie and Freddie Week here at PLANET MONEY.

GOLDSTEIN: Woo.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter). Sorry. I get really fired up about mortgage finance stuff.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Exactly. They are two of the strangest companies in U.S. history. Today, we're going to be telling the fascinating story of their rise and fall. And on Friday, we're going to talk about what it means that we, the taxpayers, now own them and what we should do with them. To help us tell these stories, we have teamed up with journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera. They are the authors of the book "All The Devils Are Here."

GOLDSTEIN: But first, Alex, let me give you today's PLANET MONEY indicator.

BLUMBERG: I'd love that.

GOLDSTEIN: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator is 3.1 percent. Home prices fell 3.1 percent over the past year. That's according to the latest numbers, the January numbers, from the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Those came out this morning.

BLUMBERG: And, Jacob, we were talking about this earlier. It is still shocking to me that the housing bust has been going on for five years now - five years.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Right. I mean, they - so home prices peaked back in 2006. And this five-year number, it's really striking. And it's a good reminder, I think, of just how much more complicated a housing boom and bust is than, say, a stock boom and bust. Right? The stock market collapses, everybody basically sells their stocks. Prices go down. Boom, stock market bust over. Things kind of reset. Right?

But when you have a housing boom and bust, you wind up with millions of people living in houses they can't afford, often owing more than their home is worth. It's this really messy, ugly situation. And as we're finding out now, it takes a long time to fix itself, to resolve. You know, the foreclosure rate is still rising. And so here we are five years out, and it's really striking that, you know, for the most part the economy really is getting better.

Yes, the unemployment rate is still high. But the economy is adding jobs. Exports are rising. Consumer spending is up. Manufacturing is coming back. And there is still this one great, big cloud hanging over the nation's economy. That is the housing market.

BLUMBERG: A big cloud indeed (laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter).

BLUMBERG: That actually is sort of apropos of what we're being - talking about today, is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

GOLDSTEIN: And, Alex, I've been listening to you report this story for a long time. I'm very excited to hear it. And so we're going to do something we occasionally do here on the podcast. I'm just going to turn it over to you Alex, give it to me.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) All right. Thanks very much. OK. So I'm going to start us off here with a statistic - 90 percent of mortgages made in the United States today are backed by the U.S. government. That's right, 90 percent. Nine out of 10 home buyers get their loans because of the U.S. government. The U.S. mortgage market, all $1.5 trillion of it, is effectively a state-run industry. And it became a state-run industry in 2008, when the government took over the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

And the story of how these mortgage giants became so large that they had to get taken over by the U.S. government is a fascinating tale, and I'm going to be telling it today. And it starts back in the Great Depression. President Roosevelt was looking for a way to help poor people get houses. And so he started an agency that later got nicknamed Fannie Mae to make mortgages more available. For decades, Fannie Mae remained part of the budget, until 1968, when President Lyndon Johnson was facing big deficits due to the Vietnam War. Here's journalist Joe Nocera.

JOE NOCERA: So Fannie was sort of spun off as a (laughter) - almost like a corporate spin-off. And there's - really was nothing like it in American life.

BLUMBERG: By privatizing Fannie Mae, Johnson had ushered into existence perhaps the strangest hybrid entity in the annals of American finance. It was an organization created by the government with an explicitly public mission but that behaved exactly like a private corporation with highly paid executives, profits going directly to private owners. Several years later, the government created a second, nearly identical entity, Freddie Mac, to give Fannie Mae some competition. Karen Petrou is an analyst who's studied Fannie and Freddie for decades. And she says this strange hybrid status gave Fannie and Freddie a very real advantage over other traditional companies because there was this belief about them.

KAREN PETROU: That even though Fannie and Freddie were private shareholder-owned companies where the CEOs made millions and investors often made a lot of money, they were backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Sure, it wasn't official, but it was as good as gold.

BLUMBERG: Gold indeed. Just as it's easier to get a loan if you have a rich relative co-sign, the financial world assumed that since the U.S. government had given birth to Fannie and Freddie, in a crisis it would act like the rich parent it was and bail them out. And so because of this implicit government guarantee, as it came to be called, Fannie and Freddie had this huge advantage in the marketplace. And to understand why, it helps to understand what Fannie and Freddie (laughter) actually do.

OK. So I'm going to explain it. I'm going to start with you. You want to buy a house. You go to the bank. The bank gives you a mortgage. But the bank doesn't hold on to your mortgage. It turns around and sells the mortgage to Fannie or Freddie. Fannie and Freddie bundle your mortgage up with a bunch of other mortgages like yours and sell that bundle - technical name, mortgage-backed security - to investors around the world.

And this is the key. The reason those investors around the world want to buy these bundles of mortgages from Fannie and Freddie? Fannie and Freddie guarantee them. They say, even if you and the other homeowners stop making their payments, global investors will still get paid by Fannie and Freddie. That is their guarantee.

Now, obviously, if those global investors believe that the U.S. government is standing behind that guarantee, it becomes a lot more valuable. And starting in the '80s and continuing for the next two decades, Fannie and Freddie used this belief, this implicit guarantee, to grow into two of the largest and most successful companies in U.S. history. Here's Bethany McLean.

BETHANY MCLEAN: Fannie and Freddie were always among the most profitable companies in the S&P 500, if not the most profitable, double or triple that of most banks.

BLUMBERG: But even though the government guarantee had turned Fannie and Freddie into two of the largest and most powerful companies in U.S. history, everywhere you turned, people denied that the guarantee actually existed. For instance, at the top of every security that Fannie and Freddie issued, right there in big, black letters it said, this security is not backed by the U.S. government. High-powered government officials denied it, from George Bush's former Treasury secretary John Snow to the powerful Democratic congressman Barney Frank. Here he is in September 2003.

BARNEY FRANK: There is no guarantee. There's no explicit guarantee. There's no implicit guarantee. There's no wink-and-nod guarantee. Investing, you're on your own. Nobody who invests in them should come looking to me for a nickel, and nor anybody else in the federal government.

BLUMBERG: And adding to the chorus of denial, says journalist Joe Nocera, were Fannie and Freddie themselves.

NOCERA: They would adamantly lash back at anybody who argued that there was in fact a government subsidy.

BLUMBERG: That's what they said in public, anyway. But to the people who mattered, the ones who were buying Fannie and Freddie's securities, the company said something else entirely. Scott Simon was one of those buyers. He heads the mortgage department at PIMCO, the world's largest bond manager and one of the biggest buyers of Fannie and Freddie's securities.

SCOTT SIMON: Fannie and Freddie in, you know, meetings with investors, whether it was us or anybody else essentially, just would sort of laugh at it and say, well, you know, the government will stand behind us.

BLUMBERG: They would literally say that to you as investors?

SIMON: I think they said that to most investors. You know, they would sort of wink and nod and just sort of say something along the lines of, well, you know, the government can't let us go.

RICHARD BAKER: They kept all the money they made, and they passed on the risk to the taxpayer in case of a downside event.

BLUMBERG: Richard Baker was a congressman from Louisiana and a longtime critic of Fannie and Freddie. And he was especially concerned about a downside event because Fannie and Freddie were especially unprepared for one. In the language of finance, they didn't have enough capital. Capital is the money financial institutions use as a buffer in case of emergency. And Fannie and Freddie were allowed to hold less than half as much capital as regular banks. This made them riskier but also more profitable. These low-capital requirements, combined with the implicit government guarantee, amounted to a giant subsidy for Fannie and Freddie. And for years, Baker tried to get rid of the subsidy to make Fannie and Freddie hold more capital. And for years, Fannie and Freddie shot him down.

BAKER: Nothing before or ever since, in my judgment, has ever been as effective as their lobbying strategy, breadth and width.

PETROU: Fannie and Freddie had the most formidable lobbying machines known to man.

BLUMBERG: Again, analyst Karen Petrou.

PETROU: That was an institutionalized facet of both of their corporate cultures.

BAKER: If you were a financial services industry lobbyist available for duty in the 1990s, and you were not either hired by Fannie or Freddie, I hate to say it now in historical retrospect, but you were really not much of a player.

BLUMBERG: And that, again, was Richard Baker. The Fannie Mae lobbying operation in particular was legendary. But occasionally congressmen would have enough courage to actually talk about it in public.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAKE PICKLE: I think we should have done better. We have once again left the public purse exposed to the risk of capital greed and corporate mismanagement.

BLUMBERG: Like Jake Pickle, Democrat from Texas. Here he is in 1992. Pickle had worked to impose stricter capital requirements on Fannie and Freddie, which he called by their technical name, the GSEs. His efforts were defeated.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PICKLE: I know the pressures that have been brought to bear on the members and the staff of the Banking Committee. I watched strong voices in the administration turn silent. I deeply wish we could go further. But in the face of enormous pressure by the GSEs, I'm not at all sure that we can do better at this time. So today, I think the GSEs may celebrate some kind of a victory. Private fortunes will be or can be made by trading on the implicit federal guarantee these GSEs enjoy. But the struggle to hold them will come at a later day.

PETROU: We used to call them privately Fortress Fannie Mae.

BLUMBERG: Again, Karen Petrou. As an analyst, she would often give expert testimony on Capitol Hill, saying Fannie and Freddie didn't have enough capital. Fannie and Freddie didn't like that.

PETROU: Fortress Fannie Mae. That's partly because the corporate headquarters looked like that. But I think it was much more because they really were that. They had this everyone who doesn't agree with us is an enemy view.

BLUMBERG: Now, this is the point in this story where usually you'd expect to hear denials from Fannie and Freddie, saying, we weren't that bad. Tales about our lobbying are exaggerated. Not so. Ladies and gentlemen, here's Fannie Mae's chief lobbyist who left the company in 2004, Bill Maloney.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BILL MALONEY: It was always an us - a very us-against-them. You know, that was just the Fannie Mae - we - you know, we - I joke with you. You know, if you punch my brother, I'll burn down your house. I want to kill them, bury them and piss on their graves.

BLUMBERG: Bill Maloney had many ways to kill them, bury them and - you know the rest. And a lot of these ways went beyond just plain lobbying dollars. For example, he banded together with realtors and home builders to form what people called the home ownership mafia. And he would remind Congresspeople every chance he got, oh, and by the way? A third to a half of the people in the country got their homes through us. And homeowners, they vote. Here's journalist Joe Nocera.

NOCERA: Any time there was a congressional hearing that was even slightly controversial surrounding Fannie Mae, you know, every congressman at that hearing would get a Fannie pack, which was a list - a pretty fat list - of every mortgage in the person's district that had been guaranteed by Fannie Mae. So the Congressman comes in. He sees the Fannie pack. It's pretty darn hard to criticize Fannie Mae from your seat

BLUMBERG: But the main reason Bill Maloney and his colleagues were so cutthroat - they believed what they were selling. They saw themselves as part and parcel of the American dream. Congress had set goals for Fannie and Freddie, saying that a third to a half of the loans they dealt with were supposed to go to low and moderate-income people. So Bill Maloney argued, sure, we get special treatment. But that's because we are special. We help regular people achieve the American dream of home ownership. And many people I talked to within the companies spoke proudly of this affordability mission, believed it. People like Barry Zigas, a former Fannie Mae executive.

BARRY ZIGAS: When we did employee surveys of Fannie Mae during this period of time, which we did on a regular basis, like any big company does, it was - it kept coming up again and again and again that the motivation for the employees in the organization was knowing they were working on something that was important to everyday people, that was about a mission and that was making a difference in communities and in people's lives. And that was a very big part of the culture of the organization.

BLUMBERG: That, says Bill Maloney, is what made the lobbying effort so successful.

MALONEY: Literally to a person, from cafeteria workers on up, we felt we were the most important thing in the nation with regard to helping low, moderate-income families afford home ownership.

BLUMBERG: This view that Fannie and Freddie were private companies serving a public mission also persuaded a lot of people in Congress. It seemed like a bargain. All Congress had to do was make it easier for Fannie and Freddie to do their thing, and then they would use their massive wealth to help regular people get homes. But this argument drove a certain group of economists and other critics crazy. They just didn't believe it.

People like Dwight Jaffee, an economist at UC Berkeley, who spent his career studying the U.S. housing market, comparing it to housing markets in other countries where they have nothing like Fannie and Freddie. And he's come to a stark conclusion about the two companies.

DWIGHT JAFFEE: All of the money and all of the tax benefits and all of the Fannie and Freddie costs that we've poured into it have come to zero in terms of having any observable effect on our home ownership rates. Our rates are the same as countries that never put a penny of government resources into it.

BLUMBERG: For Dwight Jaffee, it was clear. Fannie and Freddie were getting a huge subsidy. They didn't have to hold as much capital as other companies. They made more money that way. They had this implicit guarantee. That also helped them make more money. But, he says, this subsidy? It didn't go to the people Fannie and Freddie said it went to, low and middle-income home buyers.

JAFFEE: How could Fannie and Freddie have been so counterproductive, to actually take a government subsidy and have no benefits? And the answer is the shareholders of Fannie and Freddie and the employees of Fannie and Freddie pocketed every penny of the subsidy, and they left the borrowers and the investors no better off than they would have been in a private market. Except that when we had the bailouts, of course, now we're all poor because of Fannie and Freddie.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Breaking news - the markets are reacting to the big news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as the government steps in. Let's get you through the numbers...

BLUMBERG: In the end, the implicit guarantee was a self-fulfilling prophecy. Fannie and Freddie had used the belief by the rest of the world that they were too big to fail to become too big to fail. In the fall of 2008, Fannie and Freddie between them owned or guaranteed over $5 trillion-worth of mortgages. They had a very, very tiny layer of capital. And homeowners were starting to default in record numbers, defaults the companies would have to make good on. They were on the hook for literally trillions of dollars to foreign governments, huge pension funds, a good chunk of the world's banking system.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Treasury secretary Hank Paulson said today the stakes were too big not to act.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HANK PAULSON: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil here at home and around the globe.

BLUMBERG: And so, just as decades of critics had predicted, and just as Fannie and Freddie themselves had secretly promised, the U.S. government came in and bailed them out.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: It is the largest-ever takeover of a financial institution by the federal government in American history. But with home prices plunging...

BLUMBERG: One irony in all of this - Bill Maloney and the other Fannie and Freddie lobbyists had been too successful at their jobs. If they hadn't fought off congressional efforts to make Fannie and Freddie hold more capital, to make them safer but less profitable, the companies might have been able to withstand the turmoil in the housing market. They might not have needed a government bailout in the first place.

(SOUNDBITE OF SPOON'S "BEFORE DESTRUCTION")

BLUMBERG: The implicit guarantee is now explicit. The U.S. government - you, me, taxpayers everywhere - we now own Fannie and Freddie. And now that we own them, what do we do with them? We'll have more on that on Friday's podcast.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BEFORE DESTRUCTION")

SPOON: (Singing) Just as you're leaving, you turn around and take a cold shot. Just as you're turning your back, oh, ah...

BLUMBERG: We have lots more on Fannie and Freddie on our blog, npr.org/money. And, Jacob, there's also a really great project that you're doing with our intern, Baldur.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that's right. So Baldur is from Iceland. And Iceland, as it turns out, is holding a vote. The people of Iceland are going to vote in a couple of weeks on whether they should pay back perhaps billions of dollars as a result of mistakes that bankers made a few years ago. Baldur is struggling with this decision of how to vote. And so we have a post up on the website where you can read about the issues, and you can actually say how you would vote, or how you think Baldur should vote on this. That's also at npr.org/money.

BLUMBERG: As always, we want to hear your thoughts, comments, questions, concerns - planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Alex Blumberg.

GOLDSTEIN: And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BEFORE DESTRUCTION")

SPOON: (Singing) Love, your love...

Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Alex Bloomberg and I'm Jacob Goldstein today's Tuesday March 29th
And that was Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. You heard at the top
He was testifying before the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month today on the show
We'll explore what has turned out to be the most costly bailout of the financial crisis more expensive for taxpayers than
AIG GM Citigroup Bank of America and Goldman Sachs combined
I'm talking about the bailout of the two mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
American taxpayers have so far put a hundred and thirty billion dollars into rescuing the companies that number could rise to over three hundred
Billion in the next couple of years and this week Jacob is Fannie and Freddie week here at Planet Money
I get really fired up about mortgage finance exactly. They are two of the strangest companies in US history today
We're gonna be telling the fascinating story of their rise and fall and on Friday
We're gonna talk about what it means that we the taxpayers now own them and what we should do with them
To help us tell these stories. We've teamed up with journalists Bethany McLean and Joe. No, Sarah
They are the authors of the book. All the devils are here
But first Alex, let me give you today's Planet Money indicator
I'd love that today's Planet Money indicator is 3.1 percent home prices fell
3.1 percent over the past year
That's according to the latest numbers the January numbers from the Case Schiller home price index those came out this morning
And Jacob we were talking about this earlier it is still shocking to me that the housing bust has been going on for five
Years now five years
So home prices peaked back in 2006 and this five-year number. It's it's really striking and it's a good reminder
I think of just how much more complicated a housing boom and bust is then say a stock boom and bust right the stock
Market collapses. Everybody basically sells their stocks prices go down boom stock market bust over things kind of reset
Right, but when you have a housing boom and bust you wind up with millions of people living in houses
They can't afford often owing more than their home is worth
It's this really messy ugly situation and as we're finding out now
It takes a long time to fix itself to resolve, you know
The foreclosure rate is still rising and so here we are five years out and it's really striking that you know
For the most part the economy really is getting better. Yes, the unemployment rate is still high, but the economy is adding jobs
Exports are rising consumer spending is up manufacturing is coming back and there is still this one great big cloud
Hanging over the nation's economy. That is the housing market a
big cloud indeed
And actually sort of apropos of what we're being talking about today is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Alex
I've been listening to you report this story for a long time
I'm very excited to hear it. And so we're gonna do something. We occasionally do here on the podcast
I'm just gonna turn it over to you Alex. Give it to me. All right. Thanks very much
Okay, so I'm gonna start us off here with the statistic
90% of mortgages made in the United States today are backed by the US government

90% 9 out of 10 home buyers get their loans because of the US government the US mortgage market all

Fannie and Freddie guarantee them they say even if you and the other homeowners stop making their payments
Global investors will still get paid
By Fannie and Freddie that is their guarantee

It becomes a lot more valuable
Starting in the 80s and continuing for the next two decades Fannie and Freddie used this belief this implicit guarantee
To grow into two of the largest and most successful companies in US history
Here's Bethany McLean Fannie and Freddie were always among the most profitable companies in the S&P 500 if not the most profitable

But to the people who mattered the ones who were buying Fannie and Freddie securities the company said something else entirely
Scott Simon was one of those buyers
He heads the mortgage department at PIMCO the world's largest bond manager and one of the biggest buyers of Fannie and Freddie securities
Fannie and Freddie in you know meetings with investors whether it was
Us or anybody else essentially just would sort of laugh at and say well
You know the government will stand behind us they would literally say that to you as investors
I think they said that to most investors

I'm not at all sure that we can do better at this time
So that today I think the GSE's may celebrate some kind of a victory
private fortunes
Will be or can be made by trading on the implicit
Federal guarantee these GSE's enjoy but the struggle to hold them will come a
later day
We used to call them privately Fortress Fannie Mae
Again Karen Petru as an analyst she would often give expert testimony on Capitol Hill saying Fannie and Freddie didn't have enough capital
Fannie and Freddie didn't like that Fortress Fannie Mae
It's partly because the corporate headquarters look like that, but I think it was much more because they really were that
They had this
Everyone who doesn't agree with us is an enemy view now
This is the point in the story where usually you'd expect to hear denials from Fannie and Freddie saying we weren't that bad
Tales about our lobbying are exaggerated not so ladies and gentlemen
Here's Fannie Mae's chief lobbyist who left the company in 2004 Bill Maloney
It was always an us a very us against them, you know, that was just the Fannie Mae
We you know, we I joked with you, you know
If you punch my brother, I'll burn down your house
I want to kill them bury them and piss on their graves
Bill Maloney had many ways to kill them bury them and you know the rest and a lot of these ways went
Beyond just plain lobbying dollars, for example
He banded together with realtors and homebuilders to form what people called the home ownership mafia
And he would remind congresspeople every chance he got
Oh, and by the way a third to a half of the people in the country got their homes through us and homeowners
They vote here's journalist Jonah Sarah anytime. There was a congressional hearing that was even slightly
controversial surrounding Fannie Mae
You know every congressmen at that hearing would get a fanny pack which was a list a
Pretty fat list of every mortgage in the person's district that had been guaranteed by Fannie Mae
So the Congress comes in he sees the fanny pack
It's pretty darn hard to criticize Fannie Mae from your from your seat
But the main reason bill Maloney and his colleagues were so cutthroat. They believed what they were selling
They saw themselves as part and parcel of the American dream
Congress had set goals for Fannie and Freddie saying that a third to a half of the loans they dealt with were supposed to go
To low and moderate income people. So bill Maloney argued sure we get special treatment
But that's because we are special we help regular people achieve the American dream of home ownership and
Many people I talked to within the companies spoke proudly of this affordability mission believed it
People like Barry Zegas a former Fannie Mae executive when we did
Employee surveys at Fannie Mae during this period time which we did on a regular basis like any big company does
It was it kept coming up again and again and again that the motivation for the employees in the organization was knowing they were
working on something that was important to everyday people that was about a mission and
That was making a difference in communities and in people's lives
And that was a very big part of the culture of the organization that says bill Maloney
Is what made the lobbying effort so successful literally to a person from cafeteria workers on up
We felt we were the most important thing in
The nation with regard to helping low moderate middle income families afford home ownership
This view that Fannie and Freddie were private companies serving a public mission
Also persuaded a lot of people in Congress
It seemed like a bargain all Congress had to do was make it easier for Fannie and Freddie to do their thing and then
They would use their massive wealth to help regular people get homes
But this argument drove a certain group of economists and other critics crazy
They just didn't believe it people like Dwight Jaffe an economist at UC Berkeley who spent his career studying the US housing market
Comparing it to housing markets in other countries where they have nothing like Fannie and Freddie
And he's come to a stark conclusion about the two companies all of the money and all of the tax benefits and all of the
Fannie and Freddie costs that we've poured into it have come to zero in terms of having any
Observable effect on our homeownership rates our rates are the same as countries that never put a penny of government resources into it
For Dwight Jaffe, it was clear Fannie and Freddie were getting a huge subsidy
They didn't have to hold as much capital as other companies. They made more money that way
They had this implicit guarantee that also helped them make more money
But he says this subsidy it didn't go to the people Fannie and Freddie said it went to low and middle income homebuyers
How could Fannie and Freddie have been so counterproductive to actually take a government subsidy and have no benefits and the answer is the
shareholders of Fannie and Freddie and the employees of Fannie and Freddie pocketed every penny of the subsidy and
They left the borrowers and the investors no better off than they would have been in a private market
Except that when we had the bailouts, of course now we're all poor because of Fannie and Freddie
Breaking news the markets are reacting to the big news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as the government steps in let's get you
Through the numbers in the end. The implicit guarantee was a self-fulfilling prophecy
Fannie and Freddie had used the belief by the rest of the world that they were too big to fail
To become too big to fail in the fall of 2008 Fannie and Freddie between them owned or guaranteed over five
Trillion dollars worth of mortgages. They had a very very tiny layer of capital and homeowners were starting to default in record numbers
Defaults the companies would have to make good on they were on the hook for literally trillions of dollars to foreign governments huge pension funds
A good chunk of the world's banking system Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson said today
The stakes were too big not to act Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are so large and so interwoven in our financial system
That a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil here at home and around the globe
And so just as decades of critics have predicted just as Fannie and Freddie themselves had secretly promised
The US government came in and bailed them out
It is the largest ever takeover of a financial institution by the federal government in American history
But with home when irony in all of this bill Maloney and the other Fannie and Freddie lobbyists had been too successful at
Their jobs if they hadn't fought off congressional efforts to make Fannie and Freddie hold more capital to make them safer
But less profitable the companies might have been able to withstand the turmoil in the housing market
They might not have needed a government bailout in the first place
The implicit guarantee is now explicit the US government you me taxpayers everywhere
We now own Fannie and Freddie and now that we own them. What do we do with them?
We'll have more on that on Friday's podcast
You turn around and take a cold shot
Just as you turn
We have lots more on Fannie and Freddie on our blog and PR org slash money and Jacob
There's also a really great project that you're doing with our intern Balder. Yeah, that's right
So Balder is from Iceland and Iceland as it turns out is holding a vote
The people of Iceland are gonna vote in a couple of weeks on whether they should pay back perhaps
Billions of dollars as a result of mistakes that bankers made a few years ago
Balder is struggling with this decision of how to vote and so we have a post up on the website where you can read
About the issues and you can actually say how you would vote or how you think Balder should vote on this
That's that's also at NPR org slash money as always. We want to hear your thoughts comments questions concerns
