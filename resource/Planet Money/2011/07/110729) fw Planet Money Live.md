ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Three, two, one.

UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: Hello, everyone. This is PLANET MONEY.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Great.

DAVIDSON: That was awesome. That was really good. I'm Adam Davidson. Today is Wednesday, July 27. But for those of you listening at home in the future, it's Friday, July 29.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 800. That's how many people we are so excited to be speaking to tonight at a sold-out show at the Sixth & I Synagogue in Washington D.C. Thank you all for coming.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

DAVIDSON: So today on the program, we are going to give you the conversation that we at PLANET MONEY wish was happening right now at the highest levels of government and news media. And it's also an answer to one of the most frequent complaints we get at PLANET MONEY. And that complaint is, why are you guys so negative all the time? Why do you constantly talk about how awful the economy is? Give us some optimism. And so today, we have a really nice message for you.

BLUMBERG: And actually, you know, how - you know, we're in D.C. right now. And there's this thing that I've always...

DAVIDSON: Oh, no, no. Right. Go, go.

BLUMBERG: Is that all right?

DAVIDSON: Go, go.

BLUMBERG: OK.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: My fellow Americans...

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: ...The State of the Union and of the U.S. economy is strong. No, really. It is.

DAVIDSON: Nice. That was nice. Yeah, good job.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Right. Thank you.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I think it is weird that we've reached this point where the single most controversial thing we could say is that, that the U.S. economy...

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: If you look at it in exactly the right way, precisely the right way, it really isn't that bad. Like, did you know right now - everyone says, oh, we don't make anything anymore. We're still the No. 1 manufacturer in the world.

BLUMBERG: It's true. If you ever believe this, we are global innovators in everything from technology to toothpaste to "Transformers" movies. We have one of the world's, you know, highest per capita incomes out there. We have tons of exports, thriving manufacturing jobs. And actually, this can continue for decades, you know, this beautiful scenario. It just requires one simple thing - a spirit of can-do compromise, bipartisan leadership in our - in Congress. I stepped on that. That should have been a really big laugh.

DAVIDSON: That's - yeah, I know.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: I know. Want to take it again?

BLUMBERG: Yeah, that's all right. All right. So actually, anybody here work in Congress? Anybody? All right. So is that...

DAVIDSON: I see our lobbyists looking around.

BLUMBERG: That's coming, right?

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: All right.

DAVIDSON: All right. So actually, this debt limit thing is a perfect example of the problem that we want to address. It's all this passion and drama about issues that are entirely artificial with sort of this unembarrassed, unashamed self-destruction. In other words, Congress, we feel, is behaving exactly like an episode of the "Jersey Shore."

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Although, thank God, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell have so far kept their shirts on.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: So far.

BLUMBERG: So far.

DAVIDSON: So far. Right. All right. So but tonight, we're not going to talk about August 2 or is it actually August 9 and is it a, you know, double-A rating or this or that. We're going to place this whole thing in a much bigger, decades-long context and hopefully, help you understand what the debt limit means in a much broader picture.

BLUMBERG: Right. And so we're going to back up, though. You know, I said the state of the U.S. economy is strong, and it is, as we'll show you. But you're also probably saying, wait, you know, unemployment is at near historic levels. There's underwater homeowners. There's Chinese-made goods flooding our stores. What about all that, right?

DAVIDSON: Right. And we know there is a very bad economy in the U.S. There's an economy with a lot of pain and joblessness. It's just that that bad economy lives side by side right now with a surprisingly good economy, economy that even now there's lots of good jobs. It exports goods to the rest of the world. It does really well.

BLUMBERG: And that is what we're going to be talking about tonight, not to get all John Edwards on everybody, but the story of these two American economies.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: We call it Broken America and American-Dream America. And let's start with some stats. Unemployment - 9.2%. That is bad, and it's especially bad for certain groups. The unemployment rate is 10% for people with just a high school diploma. And if you're a high school dropout, it's nearly 15%.

DAVIDSON: So high school degree or less, you are - you're absolutely living in Broken America. America is not working for you. But let's look at people with more education. If you have a B.A., your unemployment rate is just over 4%. I mean, that's considered full employment. That's really good.

BLUMBERG: And for people with professional degrees - lawyers, engineers - the unemployment rate - the economic downturn doesn't exist. The unemployment rate is less than 2%. Economists say that's actually theoretically impossible.

DAVIDSON: Although, to be fair, economists are constantly seeing things happening in the real world and saying they're theoretically impossible.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: So before we go on, I just want to do a little quick - you know, we know from research that people tend to - people who tend to go to public radio events in synagogues in Washington D.C...

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: ...Probably are going to skew into the college-educated, you know, category, which means you should also skew, if the data is to be believed, into the employed category. And we always love to verify carefully assembled, statistically rigorous Bureau of Labor Statistics data with entirely irresponsible anecdotal polling of our own. So if you don't mind, could we get a show of hands anyone out there who in this audience who is unemployed? And we're just curious - and this is - this means - not - this is like if you are looking for a job, but you can't find one. Raise your hand if you're unemployed looking for a job and you can't find one. One, two, three, four, five, six - six people out of 800.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, so that's right in line with a professional audience. And what we have to say to you is actually good news. For you, it's going to be OK.

BLUMBERG: It might not feel like it now but statistically speaking.

DAVIDSON: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: It's going to be OK.

DAVIDSON: It's going to be OK. The economy's going to grow. But for Broken America, for people who don't have that skill, there is something much worse going on.

BLUMBERG: Right. Something really weird - a fundamental shift. So from around 1620 to roughly 1970 - that's 360 years for people who are counting - there is this remarkable, unprecedented in the history of the world unrepeated fact - the vast majority of people in America did better from one generation to the next. Now, of course, there were horrible exceptions throughout our history, you know, there was slavery, Native Americans, but for most Americans, for most of American history, they did better than their parents, their children did better than them.

DAVIDSON: And that's - you know, that's the definition of the American dream, right? The rich get richer, OK, but the poor also get richer. But sometime in the 1970s, that stopped.

BLUMBERG: Let's peg it at 1978 - the year the American dream officially died.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLUMBERG: In retrospect, the signs were all around us.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU")

BARRY MANILOW: (Singing) You know I can't smile without you...

BLUMBERG: Everybody.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

BLUMBERG: This, of course, is Barry Manilow from his smash hit from 1978. And, you know, all the songs were this bad. In case you think we're - we're not just cherry-picking the data here. Here's another one.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "NIGHT FEVER")

BEE GEES: (Singing) Night fever, night fever. We know how to do it. Gimme that night fever, night fever, we know how to show it.

BLUMBERG: This is one of five hits from that year.

DAVIDSON: Top 10 hits.

BLUMBERG: Top 10 hits by somebody with the last name Gibb.

DAVIDSON: So I think we have now statistically proven that disco did destroy America.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: All right. Now, what we're specifically talking about is a trend that began in the late 1970s and has continued to today, which is that for a large number of Americans, they saw that their inflation-adjusted wages either stayed flat or actually fell. And economists, who always look for an opportunity to quibble, do quibble a lot on this. They quibble on exactly why did this happen or how many people are affected or exactly how big the trend is. But the broad, broad view from left to right is that something big and fundamental has happened. For the first time in American history for an entire generation - more than a generation - tens of millions of Americans - we put it at somewhere around 80 million possibly - are not seeing their quality of life improving dramatically from their parents. And their kids' outlook looks even grimmer.

BLUMBERG: And that is because, broadly speaking, there used to be two paths to the American dream. You could use your mind, or you could use your body. You could work in a factory, and you could do very well working in a factory. You could earn yourself a house, a car, a nice vacation.

DAVIDSON: And one of my favorite things about my job is I get to fly around the country and go to a lot of factories. I love going to factories. They still exist in America. They're still churning out lots and lots of things. But the striking thing is you walk into these big factories, and you don't see that many people. What you see are really expensive machines run by computers. And the only people there have to be trained enough to understand how to fix those machines or how to program the computers that tell the machines exactly how to make stuff.

BLUMBERG: Right, and so factory work is now thinking work. And if some company does make a product that requires a lot of low-skilled workers, chances are they won't be American workers. So this has been going on since the '70s, but it's been sort of masked in this weird way. People aren't actually as aware of their declining incomes as maybe they should have been.

DAVIDSON: Yeah because, in part, earnings have been replaced by borrowing. You know, it's hard to say that the American dream is dead if everybody who wants a house can get a house pretty easily. A guy who embodies this for us is a guy named Clarence who we met a couple years ago. He made about $45,000 a year - less than inflation adjusted terms than his parents did. And he had three part-time, not-very-steady jobs. And he was able to borrow a huge amount of money.

CLARENCE: Call it 540 for round figures.

BLUMBERG: You basically borrowed $540,000 from the bank and they didn't check your income.

CLARENCE: It's a no income verification loan. They don't call me up and say, you know, how much money - they don't do that. I mean, it's almost like you pass a guy in the street and say, can you lend me $540,000? He said, well, what do you do? I got a job. OK. It seems as if it's that casual even though there are a lot of papers that get filled out and stuff flies all over with the faxes and the emails and all like that. Essentially, that's the process.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BLUMBERG: Would you have loaned you the money?

CLARENCE: I wouldn't have loaned me the money. And nobody that I know would have loaned me the money. I mean, I know guys who are criminals that wouldn't lend me that money, and they'd break your kneecaps, so (laughter), you know, yeah. I mean, I don't know why the bank did it. I'm serious. I needed $540,000, a person with bad credit.

DAVIDSON: Now, there is a little bit of a story behind people getting home loans that they can't pay back. And that's not where we're going to go into. We've spent...

BLUMBERG: That's a whole other hour, yes.

DAVIDSON: Hour-long talk. We've spent a lot of last few years looking at that. But suffice it to say that this current crisis and the ending of the housing bubble has ripped away the thin veneer of fantasy that the American dream is available to anybody willing to work a full day, that they can get a home, get a car, have a better life. And I'm just realizing, Alex...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...We set this whole thing up that we're going to tell them how to be optimistic...

BLUMBERG: I know.

DAVIDSON: ...And happy. Yeah (laughter). How are we doing?

BLUMBERG: How are you guys feeling so far? All right. No, but we - OK. So here's where the - we - remember; we said looked at in a certain way, we can be optimistic. And so this is where we're going to start talking about that. So it's actually, we're going to argue, not that hard for the people in Broken America to regain the American dream. And the idea is basically to take those 80 million or so Americans who live in Broken America who have a high school degree or less and figure out a way to get them into American-Dream America. And we have a simple three-part plan to do that - very simple. Are you ready? Step one - fix our nation's education system.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Step two - fix government finances.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: And then step three - when you're done with all that, fix the nation's health care system. Once we do all that, problem takes care of itself.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. We're done.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: All right. All right. It's not that simple, but it's also not that hard. I swear. And we're going to explain this to you. So when you see terrifying news on the TV - not on the radio. We're always very measured. But when you see terrifying news on the TV and you start fearing that you or your kids are going to live in some apocalyptic hellscape of a global empire gone to seed...

BLUMBERG: Like England.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Just remember our problems are not insurmountable.

BLUMBERG: All right. So let's start with step one - education. All right. So there is this simple problem. For American-Dream America, educated America, it's been really great that we've let factories. Educated people who work in services - they make more money. Also, your backs hurt less. Every once in a while, we get interrupted on our speeches by the cellphones. But that's a minor problem...

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: ...Compared to, like, losing a limb in an industrial accident or something like that. Like, the factory work for educated America, for American-Dream America - moving out of the factory has been good.

DAVIDSON: But for people without education, without skill, you know the drill. Leaving factories is bad, bad news - you know, Walmart, McDonald's, middle-aged people doing the jobs that teenagers used to do.

BLUMBERG: So one thought - you just take those 80 million people, the ones with only a high school degree or less, and we give them the skills they need to get better jobs. We train them. And for decades, just give them these skills to move them into American-Dream America. And for decades, both Republican and Democratic administrations have promoted job training programs of this sort as a way of putting people to work.

And the idea is really logical. There's only one problem. It doesn't work, at least according to a Nobel Prize-winning economist who studied this problem, a guy named James Heckman, who we talked to. And he conducted the study of the effectiveness of these job training programs and specifically job training programs aimed at young adults with a limited education. And he divided this population that he was studying into two groups. One group went through a job training program; one group didn't. And then he followed up with them to see which group did better at getting a job.

JAMES HECKMAN: The results of these job training programs were especially disappointing. I mean, for boys, they would have been better off if they hadn't gone into the program. And for many other groups, the effects were basically zero.

BLUMBERG: So these programs were supposed to train you in a new skill that would enable you to get a better job. And when you looked at them, they didn't do that. And in some cases, they actually made it worse off.

HECKMAN: They harmed people. Correct. There wasn't a - there was - certainly was no positive benefits. And so the general feeling that I came out with - I was quite depressed in some sense 'cause I really was hopeful, as were many, that such programs would have a big effect.

BLUMBERG: I saw this exact thing in action recently. I did a story for This American Life, a PLANET MONEY story in Rochester, N.Y., which is a perfect place to see what we're describing in action. Rochester has this economy that kind of surrounds downtown. It's Kodak and Xerox and Bausch & Lomb. It's these big, high-end research facilities where Ph.D.s come up with new ideas and advanced manufacturing, where people with high school plus some extra training, some technical expertise make amazing products and live pretty well in the surrounding suburbs.

And then you go to downtown Rochester, the center city, and it's some of the poorest neighborhoods in America. The Department of Labor spent several million dollars on a program called Pathways Out of Poverty. And someone pointed out that's a terrible acronym for a program with marginal success.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: I thought I was going to have to spell it out.

BLUMBERG: No, (unintelligible).

DAVIDSON: No, they got it. Its acronym city here. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, exactly.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: They know. And I went to their training programs, and a few things struck me. One is, as far as I could tell, every high school dropout in Rochester has been through a million training programs. There are so many training programs. They're just not training them for the right things. And what they don't train them for are the basic skills that they need.

So the program that I reported on found that the things they needed to learn were things like it's important to show up at the same place at the same time every day. It's - surprisingly, it's really important to bathe if you're going to have a job interview. And even at that very basic skill level, what they found is the vast majority of people who came into the program, who were guaranteed a job if they stuck through it, dropped out before the program was over.

BLUMBERG: And this is what James Heckman found as well; that before you can even acquire, like, the technical skills that you need to succeed in the new economy, in American-Dream America, you need this whole other set of skills. And Heckman, the economist, called them soft skills. These are sort of intangible, harder-to-quantify skills. Some of us might not think of them as skills at all - the way you interact with people. Are you curious? Do you make eye contact? Do you smile? Are you open to new experience? Can you pay attention and focus? Can you control your temper - that's a big one - so that you don't get mad at people at work but also you don't get frustrated and quit? These are skills that didn't matter that much in a world where brute labor could get you into the middle class. But today, they're essential.

DAVIDSON: And so Heckman did these studies, and then he worked with other people who did studies. And he wanted to find out, what's the point where it makes sense to train people in these skills? Technical school? Turns out that's too late. High school's too late. Middle school turned out to be too late. Elementary school turned out to be too late. But he did find one incredible institution in America where these skills are taught every day.

JUSTIN: I love trains. That's why I'm going to make a train.

BLUMBERG: You're going to make a train?

JUSTIN: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: This is professor Morton Siebler (ph) from Stanford, an expert in locomotive engineering. I'm just kidding.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: I was just kidding. That with Justin (ph). He's 3.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: And he's a student at the Co-Op Preschool in Brooklyn.

DAVIDSON: And he is right now 3 years old. This is exactly the age where you learn the successful skills that turn out to be so crucial 20 years later when Justin wants a job. Preschool is what James Heckman decided - discovered is the place to intervene to help people from bad America get in to American-Dream America.

BLUMBERG: Right. And there - there's a bunch of studies that he looked at. But one of the best ones is this pretty mind-blowing study. It's revolutionary. It's from the '60s, and it's called the Perry Preschool Project - took place in Ypsilanti, Mich.

DAVIDSON: And so what they did was they took a whole bunch of kids from poor families, and only 1% or 2% of the families had ever been to a museum. These were poor families. And they were randomly selected to go into one of two groups. One group - they did nothing. They just stayed at home, lived their life. The other group got two hours a day, just two hours a day of preschool; not even a special preschool, just an average decent preschool.

BLUMBERG: It was a good preschool actually. You were freelancing there with the - it was a pretty good preschool.

DAVIDSON: Oh, OK. It was pretty good preschool? OK.

BLUMBERG: It was a high-quality preschool. That was important.

DAVIDSON: All right.

BLUMBERG: Right. But - and so - but both groups at 5 years of age, they went back into the same Ypsilanti public school system, and they just basically lived the rest of lives. So from kindergarten to graduation from college - from high school, for those who graduated, they were in exactly the same milieu. There was no more intervention. And then the researchers followed up with these kids when they became adults. And the difference that preschool made was utterly astounding.

So - and Heckman's going to use the term control group and treatment group in this tape that you're about to hear. The control group was the group that didn't get preschool. The treatment group got preschool. And at 27, the boys in the control group, non-preschool, they got arrested a lot, more than two times each boy. But in preschool, the treatment group...

HECKMAN: In the treatment group, that was cut in half.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

HECKMAN: You look at monthly earnings on the job - the control group is earning about two-thirds of what the treatment group is earning.

DAVIDSON: So 20 years after getting two hours a day of preschool, they're getting arrested half as much. They're earning a third more money. I mean, preschool clearly will pay back in dividends over your entire life.

BLUMBERG: And there was a whole bunch of stuff like that. Like, the girls who got preschool, when they got to age 27, they were 50% more likely to have a savings account. They were 20% more likely to have a car. Again, two hours of preschool, two years out of their lives when they were 3 to 5. Preschool kids got sick less often, were unemployed less often, committed crimes less often, went to jail less often. And the results of several other studies back this up. And this raises, for me, one of the biggest questions - what in the world is going on at preschool?

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: You come here every day? You come here every day?

Oh, wait. I asked an expert.

You come here every day?

ELLA: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: And when you come here, what do you do?

My favorite piece of tape that I ever gathered.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: That's Ella. She's a 3-year-old who - at the Co-op School in Brooklyn. And everyone saw during our interview, she would twirl around like a ballerina. She's not from a disadvantaged family. Her parents are paying money to send her to this preschool. But what goes on in this preschool in Brooklyn is very similar to what went on those two hours a day back in Ypsilanti in the '60s at the Perry Preschool. And Eliza's teacher - I'm sorry. Ella's teacher, Eliza, was actually better able to explain what exactly that is.

ELIZA CUTLER: They kind of - they play in the morning. And then we'll sit down and have, like, a morning meeting, which is where we - it's just, like, kind of gets them into the routine of the day, which involves, like, doing the weather and doing the calendar and, like, just having general conversation about what we might do during the day. We play outside. Then they take a little nap (laughter).

BLUMBERG: So I hung out here for a morning trying to see, like, what is going on here? What's making this happen? And it's a lot what you'd expect - kids painting with paint sets or building stuff with blocks. You have to look really, really hard to find where they're learning job skills.

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: I'm using that one.

CUTLER: Here, you can have...

UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: Not even - can't have just one?

DAVIDSON: But you can hear it. The kids are learning these crucial lessons - how to resolve conflict, how to share, how to use words to get what you want. In other words, these are the exact skills that get you to succeed in an American dream universe. It all starts right there.

BLUMBERG: Right. And here's the thing. If you don't get these crucial skills - these are the skills that enabled you to learn later on in life. If you don't get them in preschool, it's really, really hard and really expensive to get them later. As the people at POOP can tell you - I'm sorry, Pathways Out of Poverty...

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: ...Can tell you, it's really, really hard.

DAVIDSON: And really expensive.

BLUMBERG: And really expensive.

DAVIDSON: So if we all want America to thrive in 2030, it's in our interests to make sure that the kids of the people in the Broken America get to go to a decent preschool now. And there is some good news on this. It's not going to cost that much money. I mean, the thing is kids in the American-Dream America - most of us - we send our kids to preschool anyway. So there's not a lot of intervention to be done there. And how much would it cost to get all the underprivileged kids in America into preschool? It's a bargain. It's $14 billion.

BLUMBERG: And Heckman, who is an economist at the University of Chicago, says this doesn't even have to be government money. It can come from foundations, from church, from synagogue programs, whatever, as long as it comes from somewhere.

DAVIDSON: And I always point out education of poor people is a classic - what economists call a public good. It is in our interest, for our own selfish reasons, for them to get a better education. They'll pay more in taxes. They'll be better citizens. They'll invent cool gadgets that we can buy.

BLUMBERG: Which you really love, I know. I sit next to him him. He's constantly getting a cool gadget delivered to his office every single day.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, Steve Jobs can't do it all.

BLUMBERG: All right. So that's Step 1. Get those 80 million people with a high school education or less - get them educated. And preschool is a really good place to start. Of course, elementary school and high school are important, too. But the point is, relatively speaking, it's not a lot of money. And in terms of bang for your buck, it is a no-brainer.

DAVIDSON: And Alex actually has a brilliant plan to fund this directly. Alex used to be a middle school teacher. And his proposal...

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) True.

DAVIDSON: ...Is we just eliminate all education between the ages of 11 and 13 because they're not learning anything...

BLUMBERG: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: ...And just use that money between the ages of 3 and 5.

BLUMBERG: Honestly. I catch up with my students later - like, now they're, you know, 30 or something. And I run into them. I was like, you remember one thing I taught you - one thing? And they can't remember anything.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: All right. So we're not going to get into - there's some other issues with education. We'll leave those alone. Solve education. The future is ours. All right. And then speaking of no-brainers, we're going to move on to solution No. 2 - U.S. government finances. And here's the second-most controversial thing I'll say - they really are not that bad. They're not that good. Don't get me wrong. I'm not crazy. But - you - they're not, like, hide shotgun shells and gold in your basement bad.

BLUMBERG: Right. So our government debt right now is roughly 100% of GDP - roughly. That means we owe as much as all the people and businesses and government agencies are spending in a year in America. And that - certainly not good for the long term. We all know that. Generally, if you look at the data, something happens when a country gets above 90% debt to GDP, when - that's a bad line to cross.

DAVIDSON: It seems that when countries spend a lot of time above 90%, they tend to - there's no pretty way to say it. They tend to collapse.

BLUMBERG: They collapse.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. But here's the thing. We have time. It doesn't happen immediately. And it also tells us we don't have to get the debt to GDP to 0% to be reasonably healthy for a long period of time. We just need to get it below that 90%.

BLUMBERG: Seventy percent debt to GDP - that would be great. We could live with that for years. Get it down to 45%, we could probably be fine forever.

DAVIDSON: So we are saying that all this Sturm und Drang you hear on the TV, all the people poking you in the chest saying the Fed is about to collapse and gold is the only thing of value, it's over a problem that really is utterly solvable. How do you do it? There's obviously proposals from Democrats, proposals from Republicans. And in a big macro picture, it doesn't matter all that much. We know that you're going to have to cut government spending. I'm sorry, but it does seem like you'll probably have to raise some taxes, certainly get rid of those loopholes.

BLUMBERG: But this is - I think you put the I'm sorry before the wrong thing in this crowd. I think you're saying I'm sorry we have to...

DAVIDSON: Oh, right, right, right. It's public - yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: Right.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. But Social Security defense, all these, like, sacred cows, there are plenty of solid bipartisan solutions that might involve a little bit of pain on either side. But they don't seem insurmountable truly.

DAVIDSON: And then there's Medicare.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: All right. That one does seemed kind of insurmountable...

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...If I'm honest.

BLUMBERG: That one's a little hard.

DAVIDSON: That one's pretty tough. And that brings us to issue No. 3, solution No. 3 for America's long-term competitiveness. All we have to do is fix our health care system.

BLUMBERG: All right. Now this is a very thorny problem, obviously. But even here, when you step back, there are some pretty obvious truths that we think pretty much everyone can agree on that don't get out there in the main debate that often. And one of the main truths, the way we get our health care right now that we get health insurance from our employer, that is really, really weird.

MELISSA THOMASSON: Employer-based insurance is a horrible system. I mean, why would you want your employer buying your health insurance? Why on earth would you want your employer buying your groceries? You certainly wouldn't want that.

DAVIDSON: So that's Melissa Thomasson. She's an economist and economic historian at Miami University of Ohio. And she helped us picture this. Like, what if we got our groceries through some program that are our employer gave us?

BLUMBERG: Yeah. You'd have your employer-based food plan. And first of all - so if you didn't have a job or you had a part-time job without benefits, you wouldn't get food at all. You'd be really hungry. That would be awful.

DAVIDSON: But if you got, like, a great plan. Like, I'm sure NPR would sign up for the Whole Foods plan...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: You'd bring $20 copay, and you get to take as much as you want. It would be fabulous.

BLUMBERG: Right. And keep in mind, you would never see the price tag on the stuff that you would buy at the register. So if someone asks you - for example, I love my fancy Belgian beer. Like, I unfortunately know the price tag. But if someone would ask me, well, how much does it cost? I'd be like, I don't know. I spend 20 bucks.

DAVIDSON: And the weird...

BLUMBERG: I got all this stuff.

DAVIDSON: And the weirdest thing is no one sat down and planned our system. This wasn't someone's idea. It was a total accident, actually a series of historical accidents. And there's a bunch of them. It's not worth getting all the way in.

But probably the crucial moment comes during World War II. Back then, the government was really worried about inflation being another burden on a war-torn country. And so they said no companies can raise wages. But this is exactly when there's all these factories that need to churn out all this material for the war. All the young men have gone off to fight that war. And so these companies were really stuck.

THOMASSON: You can't find workers. Can you imagine in today's environment? You can't find workers who can work for you. You can't lure them by increasing wages.

BLUMBERG: And at the same time, you need to produce enormous amounts of stuff for the war effort.

THOMASSON: Right.

DAVIDSON: And you're losing...

THOMASSON: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: ...All your young, strong men.

BLUMBERG: Right.

THOMASSON: Exactly. Yeah, so what's a poor employer to do? They turn to fringe benefits. And they just started offering more and more generous health insurance plans and pensions and everything else, actually.

BLUMBERG: So before the war, 10% of the population had an - had employer-based health insurance. By 1953, over 60% of the population did. And then responding to lobbying, the government enshrined the employer-based system into our tax law.

DAVIDSON: And not only does that drive up costs for health care system, create a very skewed, unequal system, but it does this other thing, which is really bad for long-term competitiveness. It locks people into jobs, usually jobs at larger companies. And for our country to grow and prosper and do well, we want people with good ideas to feel comfortable taking a flyer and starting their own little business or going to work for their crazy cousin's startup.

BLUMBERG: To produce gadgets for you to get delivered to you at work.

DAVIDSON: Please.

BLUMBERG: Yes. And so we have this crazy historical accident of a system. And it's not really free market. It's not really government. And the good news - here is the good news - almost anything would be better.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Single-payer where the government provides insurance to everybody, a largely market-driven system where you would buy insurance the way you buy everything else - cellphones, computers, cars - either one would probably get rid of the inefficiencies that we have right now onto our system.

DAVIDSON: Right. So we're being fairly glib running through three of the most intractable issues in America. But what we're trying to explain is when you put these programs - when you put these issues on a spreadsheet, when you do the math, it really is solvable. It's solvable in a way that most Americans would feel OK with, with some compromise. And that is not something you can say about most of the other countries in the world.

I mean, we - people are very afraid of China. But for China to truly become the dominant economy, they have to pull something off that is really, really hard and nobody has quite done it yet. They have to completely transform their political and economic and probably their social system to accommodate a much broader, globally interconnected - to switch from an export-led to a consumer-led economy. That's really hard. And when you go to China, it's not clear they can pull it off.

BLUMBERG: And then there's Europe. We don't know where Europe is exactly. This big common currency experiment is not going very well at all. It's not clear how they're going to sort things out. That's a really big intractable problem.

DAVIDSON: Go around the world. Japan has more than double the debt we have and not really a credible plan to pay it off. There are many promising emerging economies, of course - you know, India, Brazil. But they have a long way to go before they're anything like a major competitor for us.

BLUMBERG: And we're not saying this to sort of say, like, look how much better we are than the rest of the world but to try to put our problems in perspective. Our problems really are "Jersey Shore" problems.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: You know? If we just cut the drama just a little bit, it wouldn't be as much fun to watch on TV - true. But on the other hand, it might just ensure a healthy future for us and our children. Thank you very much.

DAVIDSON: Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

DAVIDSON: Line up. If you want to ask a question, just line up. And we were told to walk around 'cause there's people who can't see us.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, but we got...

DAVIDSON: We forgot. Sorry.

BLUMBERG: We forgot. I'm really nervous.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Sorry.

BLUMBERG: Sorry. Yeah. Hi. But we're walking around now.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So we would love to take question and answer after...

DAVIDSON: And I guess no questions from people - you're in...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: This is American-Dream America. You guys...

BLUMBERG: You're in Broken America.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Yeah. But you guys already knew that. That's why you're up there.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Yep.

BLUMBERG: Yep. Go - yeah, we'll start...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: First of all, I'm really glad to be here. I live in California. And I'm only here for the week, so...

BLUMBERG: Oh.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I just got lucky.

BLUMBERG: Excellent.

DAVIDSON: Oh, great.

BLUMBERG: Welcome.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The question is regarding preschool. I remember reading these articles online. And my first thought was that it's not necessarily the preschool but a comparison to the home environment.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Do you know of any studies that compare, say, the American-Dream America kids...

BLUMBERG: In preschool.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: ...Who went to preschool versus those who didn't?

BLUMBERG: There - I mean, there's the - so the studies are really, really hard and expensive to do because you have to start in preschool, and then you have to wait 25 years, and then you have to follow up. So that's, like - there's very few studies on that. But there have been - economists have found other ways of studying it. Like, you study kids who go into preschool when they're 2 versus - you know, if you - anyway, it's a long - I don't want to get into it.

It seems like data suggests that even for middle-class kids, preschool has an effect. And I think most middle-class families know that. I mean, do you know how much - how expensive it is to send your kid to preschool, certainly in New York? I mean, you know, the market is pricing that value in. But I think also - but I think there's - it's absolutely true. Like, there is - for a lot of kids who aren't getting the proper stimulation in the home life, that's what preschool does. But even for middle-class kids, there's some effect. But it actually does help. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: OK.

DAVIDSON: And for poor kids, it's clearly protective. We know that.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, yeah.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: It's - absolutely.

DAVIDSON: I mean, obviously nothing beats the full package, right? But...

BLUMBERG: Right. Yeah, yeah.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Well, you know, I was just thinking that there may be less expensive or - I mean, obviously it's a bargain, as you said. But there may be other ways to do something similar 'cause - you know, I - it's all tied together, right? If the parents cannot work or they're not working and - you know, it's going to be harder on the kids if they don't have health care. And people who aren't in American-Dream America are more likely to...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: ...Lose their job if they get hurt. So just...

BLUMBERG: There's no question. And I mean - and I think obviously, the more that you can do. But I think the point of this is that in terms of, like, what if - if you had to choose your dollars and do one thing with those dollars...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...There's a lot of - you know, I mean, Heckman certainly believes that the return on the investment - like, he thought of everything in terms of return on investment.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Absolutely.

BLUMBERG: Return on investment - sending a poor kid to preschool is pretty much the most - the highest ROI you get...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: All right.

BLUMBERG: ...In terms of a social program, in terms of, like, the cost that you save later on, in terms of incarceration, all that sort of stuff, and in terms of the added earning you get from that kid.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Right. If only we could turn all those private prisons into preschools, we'd be all set.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thanks a lot, guys.

BLUMBERG: Thanks, yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Hey, guys. Thanks.

BLUMBERG: Hey.

DAVIDSON: Sure.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Kind of in a basic way - debt ceiling.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I mean, are we going to be looking August 3 at, like, an A&E reality show where, like, the repo man comes and takes up all this...

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: ...Limousine, and Boehner is going to be crying in the corner because his House bid is - I mean, what's going on with this - truly going to happen on August 3?

DAVIDSON: On August 4, we will all die.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: That's all I know.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Yeah, I guess we buried the lede.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: There - and to be honest, we're not the people for this debt ceiling thing. I mean, our editor Uri is here somewhere, and I think he's a little annoyed at us that we haven't weighed in as much as we should. But we cover economics, and this is not economics. It's a political theater. And...

(APPLAUSE)

DAVIDSON: So other than, like, solve it, you know, we don't have a lot to say.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: But we will say - I mean, it is definitely true if they don't solve it, bad things will happen.

BLUMBERG: If they don't raise the debt...

DAVIDSON: If they don't raise the debt ceiling...

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...Bad things will happen. And, you know, looking at data, you can tell a story that it's not that terrible. It would mean 50 to 80 basis point. I'm looking at Antoine (ph), who knows this much better than I. But it would, you know, add a bit to interest rates over a period of time. And it would be tough but not destructive. And you can tell a story that it would fundamentally shatter the faith in the U.S. economy in a way that will mean we will all be a bit poorer for the rest of our lives. I don't know.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: Antoine...

BLUMBERG: The one thing that he can say - whatever the size of the wound, whether it's a relatively small wound or whether it's a mortal wound, it would be entirely self-inflicted. So there's that.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, there's no real issue here.

BLUMBERG: No.

DAVIDSON: There is no real issue here.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Going back to the last part of the story that you guys were telling about, the rising health care costs. You know, I'd never heard the part of the story that employer-based health care contributes to the rise in health care costs. It's usually the aging population or the rise in specialization. So could you guys go a little more into detail about that...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: ...Like, the dynamics...

BLUMBERG: Like, the dynamics of why does having an employer-based system make health costs rise? Yeah.

DAVIDSON: I think I could do it fast, hopefully. So by creating a tax incentive for employers to offer health insurance, health insurance is cheaper. You know, they can buy a dollar of health care - health insurance for you, but you experience it as, like, having $1.30 in benefit. So it encourages, it incentivizes through government fiat, employers to offer more health insurance than you would normally get. So people who have it are overinsured, generally. And the health insurers, to compete for business, aren't competing for us; they're competing with HR departments. So they're offering a set of things that keep HR departments happy. One of the end results is those of us who have it, when we pay for our treatment, we're cut off from any kind of financial decision.

Unfortunately, in my family, I've gone through a bunch of catastrophic illnesses recently, like a few cancers and stuff, and I was really thinking about this, that obviously, with my family, I want them to live. I want them to have the best possible treatment. But just because I'm an economics reporter, I would explore how minor shifts in decision-making for equally good treatment could mean the difference in hundreds of thousands of dollars spent. But if I wasn't actively pursuing that information, it never would've come up because that was completely opaque to us. And so you get into a big issue. You know, some people do believe health care is a right, and people shouldn't have to think about money. But we do know from economics that if that's the case, then the price will continue to rise dramatically. So I don't think anybody - or very few people think we should have a system where everyone just pays a la carte. I mean, there should clearly be some risk pooling. But there are a variety of ways you can do it where we experience the economic signal without being overburdened by it.

BLUMBERG: Right. And it just gets to the point of just sort of, like, how important, like, the cost of something is in sending a signal, you know? And that's the thing that is, like, totally missing in health care. Like, you don't know. You don't know. The person who's experiencing it doesn't know. And then it goes through the insurance company, which is going to the employer. So there's sort of three steps of - between the signal. The signal gets muddy. It goes from the hospital to the insurance company to the employer to you. And by the time it gets - you know, that circuit is just very, very muddy. So they - it doesn't get communicated back. Like, that's too expensive. You don't even know how much is too expensive. So the incentive for everybody is to sort of just, like, raise the costs. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Oh, and by the way, everyone's fine - the cancer.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, yeah.

DAVIDSON: Just so you know.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

DAVIDSON: So they were treated well. All right.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: One of the things I value about PLANET MONEY is not only that - when you explain the U.S. economy but when you go abroad. And I'm thinking of stories like the Spanish banking crisis or the Iceland referendum. And so I was wondering - you spoke a lot about the U.S. today, and I was wondering if you could kind of look at the opposite side. And to what extent do you feel that when you look at the global economy, that the things, the problems we have here are out of our control? What things do you look at outside of the U.S. where you feel like, this is something that other countries have a real impact on how the U.S. is going to be going forward?

BLUMBERG: Yeah. I mean, I think most of the things - leaving aside global warming...

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: ...Which is obviously an impossible thing to leave aside, but - that's so vague I'm not sure how to account for that. But I feel like, generally, the rest of the world getting wealthier is good for us. Like, there's - I don't think there's any debate about that. More people who we can sell stuff to, more people who can sell stuff to - that's a - the more disposable income there is in the world, that's better for everybody. So...

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And the view that I get - Antoine van Agtmael's here, a friend of mine, who coined the term emerging economies and is a very important guy in emerging economic finance. You know, he's helped me understand and others have helped me understand - this is - when you look out 30 years from now, when there's a Brazil that's as rich - that's richer than we are today, an India that's richer than we are today, when basically much more of the world is a lot more like us today, we'll probably still be richer. But that's a better world. That's a politically more stable world. There's more compromise. But getting from here to there means we do become a smaller - you know, we're still probably the dominant player for a while, but we lose some power. Other people who aren't used to having power start stretching their muscles. And some countries that we maybe aren't too into having a lot of power do have a lot of power. So it's a bumpy ride, probably, as we've noticed. But the end destination should be a much better one.

BLUMBERG: All right, I'm so sorry, but...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. Thank you, guys, so much.

(APPLAUSE)

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Thank you.

**faster whisper:**
Three, two, one.
Hello, folks, I'm Adam Davidson.
That was awesome.
That was awesome.
That was really good.
I'm Adam Davidson.
Today is Wednesday, July 27.
But for those of you listening at home in the
future, it's Friday, July 29.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg.
Today's Planet Money Indicator 800.
That's how many people we are so excited to be speaking
to tonight at a sold out show at the Six and I
Synagogue in Washington, DC.
Thank you all for coming.
Yeah, thank you.
So today on the program, we are going to give you the
conversation that we at Planet Money wish was
happening right now at the highest levels of
government and news media.
And it's also an answer to one of the most frequent
complaints we get at Planet Money.
And that complaint is, why are you guys so negative
all the time?
Why do you constantly talk about how
awful the economy is?
Give us some optimism.
And so today, we have a really nice message for you.
And actually, we're in DC right now, and there's this
thing that I've always wanted to do.
Oh, no, no, right.
Go, go.
Is that all right?
Go, go.
Yeah.
My fellow Americans, the state of the union and of
the US economy is strong.
It really is.
Nice.
That was nice.
Yeah, good job.
All right.
I think it is weird that we've reached this point where
the single most controversial thing we could say is that,
that the US economy, if you look at it in exactly the
right way, precisely the right way, it
really isn't that bad.
Like, did you know right now, everyone says, oh, we
don't make anything anymore.
We're still the number one manufacturer in the world.
It's true.
No one will believe this.
We are global innovators in everything from technology to
toothpaste to Transformers movies.
We have one of the world's highest per
capita incomes out there.
We have tons of exports, thriving manufacturing jobs.
And actually, this can continue for decades, this
beautiful scenario.
It just requires one simple thing, a spirit of can-do
compromise, bipartisan leadership in Congress.
I stepped on that.
That should have been a really big laugh.
Want to take it again?
No.
Yeah, that's all right.
All right.
So actually, anybody here work in Congress?
Anybody?
All right.
So is that someone to ask for?
I see our lobbyist looking around.
That's coming, right?
Yeah.
All right.
So actually, this debt limit thing is a perfect
example of the problem that we want to address.
It's all this passion and drama about issues that are
entirely artificial with sort of this unembarrassed,
unashamed self-destruction.
In other words, Congress, we feel, is behaving exactly
like an episode of the Jersey Shore.
Although, thank God, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell
have so far kept their shirts on.
So far.
So far.
So far.
Right.
All right.
But tonight, we're not going to talk about August
2nd, or is it actually August 9th, and is it a
double A rating, or this or that.
We're going to place this whole thing in a much bigger,
decades-long context, and hopefully help you
understand what the debt limit means in a much
broader picture.
Right.
And so we're going to back up, though.
I said that the state of the US economy is strong,
and it is, as we'll show you.
But you're also probably saying, wait.
Unemployment is at near historic levels.
There's underwater homeowners.
There's Chinese-made goods flooding our stores.
What about all that?
Right.
And we know there is a very bad economy in the US.
There's an economy with a lot of pain and joblessness.
It's just that that bad economy lives side by side
right now with a surprisingly good economy.
Economy that, even now, there's lots of good jobs.
It exports goods to the rest of the world.
It does really well.
And that is what we're going to be
talking about tonight.
Not to get all John Edwards on everybody, but the
story of these two American economies.
We call it broken America and American dream America.
And let's start with some stats.
Unemployment, 9.2%.
That is bad.
And it's especially bad for certain groups.
The unemployment rate is 10% for people with just a high
school diploma.
And if you're a high school dropout, it's nearly 15%.
So high school degree or less, you're absolutely
living in broken America.
America is not working for you.
But let's look at people with more education.
If you have a BA, your unemployment
rate is just over 4%.
I mean, that's considered full employment.
That's really good.
And for people with professional degrees, lawyers,
engineers, the economic downturn doesn't exist.
The unemployment rate is less than 2%.
Economists say that's actually
theoretically impossible.
Although, to be fair, economists are constantly
seeing things happening in the real world and saying
they're theoretically impossible.
So before we go on, I just want to do a little quick.
We know from research that people who tend to go to public
radio events in synagogues in Washington, DC, probably are
going to skew into the college-educated category,
which means you should also skew, if the data is to be
believed, into the employed category.
And we always love to verify carefully assembled
statistically rigorous Bureau of Labor Statistics data with
entirely irresponsible anecdotal polling of our own.
So if you don't mind, could we get a show of hands, anyone
out there in this audience who is unemployed?
And we're just curious.
And this means if you are looking for a job but you
can't find one.
Raise your hand if you are unemployed looking for a job
and you can't find one.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six people out of 800.
Yeah, so that's right in line with a professional
audience.
And what we have to say to you is actually good news.
For you, it's going to be OK.
It might not feel like it now, but statistically speaking,
it's going to be OK.
The economy is going to grow.
But for broken America, for people
who don't have that skill, there
is something much worse going on.
Something really weird, a fundamental shift.
So from around 1620 to roughly 1978,
that's 360 years for people who are counting,
there is this remarkable, unprecedented
in the history of the world, unrepeated fact.
The vast majority of people in America
did better from one generation to the next.
Now, of course, there were horrible exceptions
throughout our history.
There was slavery, Native Americans.
But for most Americans, for most of American history,
they did better than their parents,
their children did better than them.
And that's the definition of the American dream, right?
The rich get richer, OK.
But the poor also get richer.
But sometime in the 1970s, that stopped.
Let's peg it at 1978, the year the American dream officially
died.
In retrospect, the signs were all around us.
Everybody.
This, of course, is Barry Manilow from his smash hit
from 1978.
And all the songs were this bad.
In case you think we're not just cherry picking
the data here.
Here's another one.
This is one of five hits from that year.
Top 10 hits.
Top 10 hits by somebody with the last name Gibb.
So I think we have now statistically proven
that disco did destroy America.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It did.
It destroyed America.
All right.
Now, what we're specifically talking about
is a trend that began in the late 1970s
and has continued to today, which is that
for a large number of Americans,
they saw that their inflation-adjusted wages
either stayed flat or actually fell.
And economists who always look for an opportunity
to quibble do quibble a lot on this.
They quibble on exactly why did this happen
or how many people are affected
or exactly how big the trend is.
But the broad, broad view from left to right
is that something big and fundamental has happened.
For the first time in American history,
for an entire generation, more than a generation,
tens of millions of Americans,
we put it at somewhere around 80 million, possibly,
are not seeing their quality of life
improving dramatically from their parents.
And their kid's outlook looks even grimmer.
And that is because, broadly speaking,
there used to be two paths to the American dream.
You could use your mind or you could use your body.
You could work in a factory.
And you could do very well working in a factory.
You could earn yourself a house, a car, a nice vacation.
And one of my favorite things about my job
is I get to fly around the country
and go to a lot of factories.
I love going to factories.
They still exist in America.
They're still churning out lots and lots of things.
But the striking thing is you walk into these big factories
and you don't see that many people.
What you see are really expensive machines
run by computers.
And the only people there have to be trained enough
to understand how to fix those machines
or how to program the computers
that tell the machines exactly how to make stuff.
Right. And so factory work is now thinking work.
And if some company does make a product
that requires a lot of low-skilled workers,
chances are they won't be American workers.
So this has been going on since the 70s.
But it's been sort of masked in this weird way.
People aren't actually as aware of their declining incomes
as maybe they should have been.
Yeah. Because in part,
earnings have been replaced by borrowing.
You know, it's hard to say that the American dream is dead
if everybody who wants a house can get a house pretty easily.
A guy who embodies this for us is a guy named Clarence,
who we met a couple of years ago.
He made about $45,000 a year,
less in inflation-adjusted terms than his parents did.
And he had three part-time, not very steady jobs.
And he was able to borrow a huge amount of money.
Call it 540 for round figures.
You basically borrowed $540,000 from the bank,
and they didn't check your income.
Right. It's a no-income verification loan.
They don't call me up and say, you know,
how much money? They don't do that.
I mean, it's almost like you pass a guy in the street
and you say, you lend me $540,000?
He said, well, what do you do?
I got a job. Okay.
It seems as if it's that casual,
even though there are a lot of papers that get filled out
and stuff flies all over with the faxes and the emails
and all like that.
Essentially, that's the process.
Would you have loaned you the money?
I wouldn't have loaned me the money.
And nobody that I know would have loaned me the money.
I mean, I know guys who are criminals
that wouldn't lend me that money,
and they're breaking kneecaps.
Yeah, I don't know why the bank did it.
I'm serious.
$540,000 a person with bad credit.
Now, there is a little bit of a story
behind people getting home loans that they can't pay back,
and that's not where we're going to go into.
We've spent an hour-long talk.
We've spent a lot of last few years looking at that.
But suffice it to say that this current crisis
and the ending of the housing bubble
has ripped away the thin veneer of fantasy
that the American dream is available to anybody
willing to work a full day,
that they can get a home, get a car, have a better life.
And I'm just realizing, Alex,
we set this whole thing up,
that we're going to tell them how to be optimistic.
I know.
How are we doing?
How are you guys doing so far?
All right.
Okay, so here's where the...
Remember, we said, look at that in a certain way.
We can be optimistic.
And so this is where we're going to start talking about that.
So it's actually, we're going to argue,
not that hard for the people in broken America
to regain the American dream.
And the idea is basically to take those 80 million or so Americans
who live in broken America, who have a high school degree or less,
and figure out a way to get them into American dream America.
And we have a simple three-part plan to do that.
Very simple. Are you ready?
Step one, fix our nation's education system.
Step two, fix government finances.
And then step three, when you're done with all that,
fix the nation's health care system.
Once we do all that, problem takes care of itself.
We're done. All right.
It's not that simple, but it's also not that hard, I swear.
And we're going to explain this to you.
So when you see terrifying news on the TV,
not on the radio, we're always very measured,
but when you see terrifying news on the TV,
and you start fearing that you or your kids are going to live
in some apocalyptic hellscape of a global empire gone to seed...
Like England.
Yeah.
Just remember, our problems are not insurmountable.
All right. So let's start with step one, education.
All right. So there's this simple problem.
For American dream America, educated America,
it's been really great that we've left factories.
Educated people who work in services, they make more money.
Also, your backs hurt less.
Every once in a while, we get interrupted
or our speeches by cell phones, but that's a minor problem
compared to losing a limb in an industrial accident
or something like that.
The factory work for educated America,
for American dream America,
moving out of the factory has been good.
But for people without education, without skill,
you know the drill.
Leaving factories is bad, bad news.
Walmart, McDonald's, middle-aged people
doing the jobs that teenagers used to do.
So one thought, we just take those 80 million people,
the ones with only a high school degree or less,
and we give them the skills they need to get better jobs.
We train them.
And for decades, just give them these skills
to move them into American dream America.
And for decades, both Republican and Democratic administrations
have promoted job training programs of this sort
as a way of putting people to work.
And the idea is really logical.
There's only one problem.
It doesn't work.
At least, according to a Nobel Prize-winning economist
who studied this problem, a guy named James Heckman,
who we talked to, and he conducted this study
of the effectiveness of these job training programs.
And specifically, job training programs aimed at young adults
with a limited education.
And he divided this population that he was studying
into two groups.
One group went through a job training program.
One group didn't.
And then he followed up with them to see
which group did better at getting a job.
The results of these job training programs
were especially disappointing.
I mean, for boys, they would have been better off
if they hadn't gone into the program.
And for many other groups, the effects were basically zero.
So these programs were supposed to train you in a new skill
that would enable you to get a better job.
And when you looked at them, they didn't do that.
And in some cases, they actually made it even worse off.
They harmed people, correct.
There certainly was no positive benefit.
And so the general feeling that I came out with,
I was quite depressed in some sense,
because I really was hopeful, as were many,
that such programs would have a big effect.
I saw this exact thing in action recently.
I did a story for This American Life,
a Planet Money story, in Rochester, New York,
which is a perfect place to see
what we're describing in action.
Rochester has this economy that kind of surrounds downtown.
It's Kodak and Xerox and Bausch and Lomb.
It's these big, high-end research facilities
where PhDs come up with new ideas
and advanced manufacturing,
where people with high school plus some extra training,
some technical expertise make amazing products
and live pretty well in the surrounding suburbs.
And then you go to downtown Rochester, the center city,
and it's some of the poorest neighborhoods in America.
The Department of Labor spent several million dollars
on a program called Pathways Out of Poverty.
And someone pointed out,
that's a terrible acronym for a program with marginal success.
I thought I was going to have to spell it out.
No, they got it. It's Acronym City here.
And I went to their training programs,
and a few things struck me.
One is, as far as I can tell,
every high school dropout in Rochester
has been through a million training programs.
There's so many training programs,
they're just not training them for the right things.
And what they don't train them for
are the basic skills that they need.
So the program that I reported on
found that the things they needed to learn
were things like, it's important to show up
at the same place at the same time every day.
It's, surprisingly, it's really important to bathe
if you're going to have a job interview.
And even at that very basic skill level,
what they found is the vast majority of people
who came into the program,
who were guaranteed a job if they stuck through it,
dropped out before the program was over.
And this is what James Heckman found as well,
that before you can even acquire the technical skills
that you need to succeed in the new economy,
in American Dream America,
you need this whole other set of skills.
And Heckman, the economist, called them soft skills.
These are sort of intangible, harder-to-quantify skills.
Some of us might not think of them as skills at all.
The way you interact with people,
are you curious, do you make eye contact,
do you smile, are you open to new experience,
can you pay attention and focus,
can you control your temper, that's a big one,
so that you don't get mad at people at work,
but also you don't get frustrated and quit.
These are skills that didn't matter that much
in a world where brute labor
could get you into the middle class.
But today they're essential.
And so Heckman did these studies,
and then he worked with other people who did studies,
and he wanted to find out what's the point
where it makes sense to train people in these skills.
Technical school, turns out that's too late.
High school's too late.
Middle school turned out to be too late.
Elementary school turned out to be too late.
But he did find one incredible institution in America
where these skills are taught every day.
I love trains.
That's why I'm going to make a train.
You're going to make a train?
Yeah.
This is Professor Morton Siebler from Stanford,
an expert in locomotive engineering.
I'm just...
I'm just kidding.
I was just kidding.
That was Justin. He's three.
And he's a student at the co-op preschool in Brooklyn.
And he is, right now, three years old.
This is exactly the age
where you learn these successful skills
that turn out to be so crucial
20 years later when Justin wants a job.
Preschool is what James Heckman decided, discovered,
is the place to intervene,
to help people from bad America
get into American dream America.
And there's a bunch of studies that he looked at,
but one of the best ones is this pretty mind-blowing study.
It's revolutionary. It's from the 60s,
and it's called the Perry Preschool Project.
It took place in Ypsilanti, Michigan.
So what they did was they took a whole bunch of kids
from poor families,
and only 1% or 2% of the families had ever been to a museum.
These were poor families,
and they were randomly selected to go into one of two groups.
One group, they did nothing.
They just stayed at home, lived their life.
The other group got two hours a day,
just two hours a day of preschool.
Not even a special preschool,
just an average, decent preschool.
It was a good preschool, actually.
You were freelancing there.
It was a pretty good preschool.
It was a high-quality preschool.
But both groups, at five years of age,
they went back into the same Ypsilanti public school system,
and they just basically lived the rest of their lives.
So from kindergarten to graduation from college,
from high school, for those who graduated,
they were in exactly the same milieu.
There was no more intervention.
And then the researchers followed up with these kids
when they became adults.
And the difference that preschool made
was utterly astounding.
And Heckman's going to use the term
control group and treatment group
in this tape that you're about to hear.
The control group was the group that didn't get preschool.
The treatment group got preschool.
And at 27, the boys in the control group,
non-preschool, they got arrested a lot,
more than two times each boy.
But in preschool, the treatment group?
In the treatment group, that was cut in half.
Wow.
You look at monthly earnings on the job,
the control group is earning about two-thirds
of what the treatment group is earning.
So 20 years after getting two hours a day of preschool,
they're getting arrested half as much.
They're earning a third more money.
Preschool clearly will pay back in dividends
over your entire life.
And there was a whole bunch of stuff like that.
The girls who got preschool, when they got to age 27,
they were 50% more likely to have a savings account.
They were 20% more likely to have a car.
Again, two hours of preschool,
two years out of their lives when they were three to five.
Preschool kids got sick less often,
were unemployed less often, committed crimes less often,
went to jail less often.
And the results of several other studies back this up.
And this raises, for me, one of the biggest questions.
What in the world is going on at preschool?
Do you come here every day?
Do you come here every day?
Oh, wait, I asked an expert.
Do you come here every day?
Yeah.
And when you come here, what do you do?
I don't know.
I just don't know.
My favorite piece of tape that I ever gathered.
That's Ella.
That's Ella.
She's a three-year-old who, at the co-op school in Brooklyn,
and every once in a while during her interview,
she would twirl around like a ballerina.
She's not from a disadvantaged family.
Her parents are paying money to send her to this preschool.
But what goes on in this preschool in Brooklyn
is very similar to what went on those two hours a day
back in Ypsilanti in the 60s at the Perry Preschool.
And Eliza's teacher, I'm sorry, Ella's teacher, Eliza,
was actually better able to explain what exactly that is.
They kind of play in the morning.
And then we'll sit down and have a morning meeting,
which is where it just kind of gets them into the routine
of the day, which involves doing the weather
and doing the calendar and just having general conversation
about what we might do during the day.
We play outside.
Then they take a little nap.
So I hung out here for a morning trying to see,
like, what is going on here?
What's making this happen?
And it's a lot what you'd expect.
Kids painting with paint sets or building stuff with blocks.
You have to look really, really hard
to find where they're learning job skills.
But you can hear it.
The kids are learning these crucial lessons,
how to resolve conflict, how to share,
how to use words to get what you want.
In other words, these are the exact skills
that get you to succeed in an American dream universe.
It all starts right there.
Right.
And here's the thing.
If you don't get these crucial skills,
these are the skills that enable you to learn
later on in life.
If you don't get them in preschool,
it's really, really hard and really expensive
to get them later.
As the people at Poop can tell you.
I'm sorry.
Pathways out of power.
Can tell you.
It's really, really hard.
And really expensive.
And really expensive.
So if we all want America to thrive in 2030,
it's in our interest to make sure
that the kids of the people in the broken America
get to go to a decent preschool now.
And there is some good news on this.
It's not going to cost that much money.
I mean, the thing is,
kids in the American dream America,
most of us, we send our kids to preschool anyway.
So there's not a lot of intervention to be done there.
And how much would it cost
to get all the underprivileged kids in America into preschool?
It's a bargain.
It's $14 billion.
And Hackman, who is an economist
at the University of Chicago,
says this doesn't even have to be government money.
It can come from foundations, from church,
from synagogue programs, whatever,
as long as it comes from somewhere.
And I always point out,
education of poor people is a classic,
what economists call a public good.
It is in our interest for our own selfish reasons
for them to get a better education.
They'll pay more in taxes.
They'll be better citizens.
They'll invent cool gadgets that we can buy.
Which you really love.
I know.
I said next time,
he's constantly getting a cool gadget
delivered to his office every single day.
Well, Steve Jobs can't do it all.
All right.
So that's step one.
Get those 80 million people
with a high school education or less.
Get them educated.
And preschool is a really good place to start.
Of course, elementary school and high school are important, too.
But the point is, relatively speaking,
it's not a lot of money.
And in terms of bang for your buck,
it is a no-brainer.
And Alex actually has a brilliant plan to fund this directly.
Alex used to be a middle school teacher.
And his proposal is we just eliminate all education
between the ages of 11 and 13.
Because they're not learning anything.
Right.
And just use that money between the ages of three and five.
Honestly, I catch up with my students later.
Like now they're 30 or something.
And I run into them.
I was like, do you remember one thing I taught you?
One thing.
And they can't remember anyway.
All right.
All right.
So we're not going to get into...
There's some other issues with education.
We'll leave those alone.
Solve education.
The future is ours.
All right.
And then speaking of no-brainers,
we're going to move on to solution number two.
U.S. government finances.
And here's the second most controversial thing I'll say.
They really are not that bad.
They're not that good.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not crazy.
But they're not like hide shotgun shells
and gold in your basement bat.
Right.
So our government debt right now is roughly 100% of GDP.
Roughly that means we owe as much as all the people
and businesses and government agencies
are spending in a year in America.
And that's certainly not good for the long term.
We all know that.
Generally, if you look at the data,
something happens when a country gets above 90% debt to GDP.
That's a bad line to cross.
It seems that when countries spend a lot of time above 90%,
they tend to...
There's no pretty way to say it.
They tend to collapse.
They collapse.
Yeah.
But here's the thing.
We have time.
It doesn't happen immediately.
And it also tells us
we don't have to get the debt to GDP to 0%
to be reasonably healthy for a long period of time.
We just need to get it below that 90%.
70% debt to GDP?
That would be great.
We could live with that for years,
get it down to 45%,
we could probably be fine forever.
So we are saying that all this sterm
and drawing you here on the TV,
all the people poking you in the chest
saying the Fed is about to collapse
and gold is the only thing of value,
it's over a problem that really is utterly solvable.
How do you do it?
There's obviously proposals from Democrats,
proposals from Republicans.
And in a big macro picture,
it doesn't matter all that much.
We know that you're going to have to cut government spending.
I'm sorry, but it does seem like
you'll probably have to raise some taxes,
certainly get rid of those loopholes.
I think you put the I'm sorry
before the wrong thing in this crowd.
I think you're saying I'm sorry.
Oh, right, right, right.
That's public.
Good job.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
But social security, defense,
all these sacred cows,
there are plenty of solid bipartisan solutions
that might involve a little bit of pain on either side,
but they don't seem insurmountable, truly.
And then there's Medicare.
All right.
That one does seem kind of insurmountable,
if I'm honest.
That was a little hard.
That one's pretty tough.
And that brings us to issue number three,
solution number three
for America's long-term competitiveness.
All we have to do is fix our health care system.
All right.
Now, this is a very thorny problem, obviously.
But even here, when you step back,
there are some pretty obvious truths
that we think pretty much everyone can agree on
that don't get out there in the main debate that often.
And one of the main truths,
the way we get our health care right now,
that we get health insurance from our employer,
that is really, really weird.
Employer-based insurance is a horrible system.
I mean, why would you want your employer
buying your health insurance?
Why on earth would you want your employer
buying your groceries?
You certainly wouldn't want that.
So that's Melissa Thomason.
Melissa Thomason, she's an economist and economic historian
at Miami University of Ohio.
And she helped us picture this.
Like, what if we got our groceries
through some program that our employer gave us?
Yeah, you'd have your employer-based food plan.
And first of all, so if you didn't have a job
or you had a part-time job without benefits,
you wouldn't get food at all.
You'd be really, really hungry.
That would be awful.
But if you got, like, a great plan,
like I'm sure NPR would sign up for the Whole Foods plan,
you bring $20 copay,
and you get to take as much as you want,
it would be fabulous.
Right.
And keep in mind, you would never see the price tag
on the stuff that you would buy at the register.
So if someone asks you, for example,
I love my fancy Belgian beer,
like, I unfortunately know the price tag,
but somebody would ask me, how much does it cost?
I'd be like, I don't know.
I spent 20 bucks.
And the weirdest thing is,
no one sat down and planned our system.
This wasn't someone's idea.
It was a total accident,
actually a series of historical accidents.
And there's a bunch of them.
It's not worth getting all the way in,
but probably the crucial moment comes during World War II.
Back then, the government was really worried about inflation
being another burden on a war-torn country.
And so they said, no companies can raise wages.
But this is exactly when there's all these factories
that need to churn out all this material for the war.
All the young men have gone off to fight that war.
And so these companies were really stuck.
You can't find workers.
Can you imagine in today's environment?
You can't find workers who can work for you.
You can't lure them by increasing wages.
And at the same time, you need to produce
enormous amounts of stuff for the war effort.
And you're losing all your young, strong men.
Exactly.
So what's a poor employer to do?
They turn to fringe benefits,
and they just started offering more and more generous
health insurance plans
and pensions and everything else, actually.
So before the war, 10% of the population
had employer-based health insurance.
By 1953, over 60% of the population did.
And then responding to lobbying,
the government enshrined the employer-based system
into our tax law.
And not only does that drive up costs for a health care system,
create a very skewed, unequal system,
but it does this other thing,
which is really bad for long-term competitiveness.
It puts people into jobs,
usually jobs at larger companies.
And for our country to grow and prosper and do well,
we want people with good ideas to feel comfortable
taking a flyer and starting their own little business
or going to work for their crazy cousin's startup.
To produce gadgets for you to get delivered to you at work.
Please.
And so we have this crazy historical accident of a system,
and it's not really free market, it's not really government.
And the good news, here's the good news,
almost anything would be better.
A single payer where the government provides insurance to everybody,
a largely market-driven system
where you would buy insurance the way you buy everything else,
cell phones, computers, cars,
either one would probably get rid of the inefficiencies
that we have right now into our system.
So we're being fairly glib,
running through three of the most intractable issues in America,
but what we're trying to explain is
when you put these programs,
when you put these issues on a spreadsheet,
it really is solvable.
It's solvable in a way that most Americans would feel okay with,
with some compromise.
And that is not something you can say
about most of the other countries in the world.
I mean, people are very afraid of China,
but for China to truly become the dominant economy,
they have to pull something off that is really, really hard,
and nobody has quite done it yet.
They have to completely transform their political
and economic and probably their social system
to accommodate a much broader, globally interconnected,
to switch from an export-led to a consumer-led economy.
That's really hard, and when you go to China,
it's not clear they can pull it off.
And then there's Europe.
We don't know where Europe is exactly.
This big common currency experiment is not going very well at all.
It's not clear how they're going to sort things out.
That's a really big, intractable problem.
Go around the world.
Japan has more than double the debt we have
and they plan to pay it off.
There are many promising emerging economies, of course.
You know, India, Brazil.
But they have a long way to go
before they're anything like a major competitor for us.
And we're not saying this to sort of say,
like, look, how much better we are than the rest of the world,
but to try to put our problems in perspective.
Our problems really are Jersey Shore problems.
You know?
If we just cut the drama just a little bit,
it wouldn't be as much fun to watch on TV, true,
but on the other hand,
it might just ensure a healthy future for us and our children.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Applause
Line up.
If you want to ask a question, just line up.
And we were told to walk around
because there's people who can't see us.
We forgot.
Sorry.
We would love to take questions and answer them after.
And I guess no questions from people.
You're in, this is American Dream America.
You guys.
Broken America.
But you guys already knew that.
That's why you're up there.
Go, yeah, we'll start.
First of all, I'm really glad to be here.
I live in California, and I'm only here for the week,
so I just got lucky.
The question is regarding preschool.
I remember reading these articles online,
and my first thought was
that it's not necessarily the preschool,
but the comparison to the home environment.
Yeah.
Do you know of any studies that compare,
say, the American Dream America kids
who went to preschool
versus those who didn't?
I mean, there's,
so the studies are really, really hard
and expensive to do because you have to start in preschool
and then you have to wait 25 years,
and then you have to follow up.
So there's very few studies in that,
and there are other ways of studying it,
like you study kids who go into preschool
when they're two versus, you know,
if you, anyway, it's a long,
I want to get into it.
It seems like data suggests that even for middle-class kids,
preschool has an effect,
and I think most middle-class families know that.
I mean, do you know how expensive it is
to send your kid to preschool, certainly in New York?
I mean, you know, the market is pricing
that value in.
But I think also,
but I think it's absolutely true.
Because for a lot of kids
who aren't getting the proper stimulation in the home life,
that's what preschool does.
But even for middle-class kids, there's some effect
that it actually does help.
And for poor kids, it's clearly protective.
We know that.
I mean, obviously, nothing beats the full package, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, I was just thinking that there may be
less expensive or,
I mean, obviously, it's a bargain, as you said,
but there may be other ways to do something similar.
Because, you know,
it's all tied together, right?
If the parents can't work or they're not working
and, you know, it's going to be harder
on the kids if they don't have health care
and people who aren't in American Dream America
are more likely to lose their job if they get hurt.
There's no question.
And I mean, I think obviously,
the more that you can do, but I think
the point of this is that in terms of
what if you had to choose your dollars
and do one thing with those dollars,
there's a lot of, you know, I mean, Heckman certainly
believes that the return on the investment,
he thought of everything in terms of return on investment.
Return on investment, sending
a poor kid to preschool
is pretty much the highest
ROI you get.
In terms of a social program, in terms of like
the cost that you save later on, in terms of incarceration,
all that sort of stuff, and in terms of the added
earning you get from that kid.
If only we could turn all those private prisons into preschools,
we'd be all set.
Hey guys, thanks.
Kind of in a basic way.
Debt ceiling.
I mean, are we going to be like on August 3rd,
like an A&E reality show where like the repo man
comes to take so far his limousine
and Boehner is going to be crying in the corner
because his house man is taking, I mean, what's going on
with this truly going to happen on August 3rd?
On August 4th, we will all die.
That's all I know.
Yeah, I guess we buried the lead.
And to be honest,
we're not the people for this
debt ceiling thing.
Our editor, Uri, is here somewhere,
and I think he's a little annoyed at us that we haven't weighed in as much as we should.
But we cover economics,
and this is not economics.
It's a political
theater.
So other than like
solve it, you know, we don't have a lot to say.
But
we will say, I mean,
it is definitely true. If they don't solve it,
bad things will happen.
If they don't raise the debt ceiling,
bad things will happen.
And
you know,
looking at data, you can tell
a story that it's not that
terrible. It would mean
50 to 80
basis points. I'm looking at Antoine,
who knows this much better than I, but it would, you know,
add a bit to interest rates
over a period of time, and it would
be tough, but not destructive.
And you can tell a story that it would
fundamentally shatter the
faith in the U.S.
economy in a way that will mean we will
all be a bit poorer for the rest
of our lives.
I don't know.
Antoine?
Whatever the size of the wound, whether it's a
relatively small wound or whether it's a mortal wound,
it would be entirely self-inflicted.
There's no real issue here.
There is no real issue here.
Going back to the last part of the story that you guys
were telling about the rise in health care costs,
you know, I never
heard the part of the story that employer-based
health care contributes to the rise
in health care costs, usually the aging
population or the rise in specialization.
So
could you guys go a little more into detail about
that? Like
the dynamics of why does
having an employer-based system make
health costs rise?
I think I could do it fast, hopefully. So by creating
a tax incentive for employers
to offer health insurance, health
insurance is cheaper. You know, they can buy a
dollar of health care, health
insurance for you, but you've experienced
it as like having a dollar or 30 cents
in benefit. So it encourages
and incentivizes, through
government fiat, employers
to offer more health insurance than you would
normally get. So people who have it
are overinsured generally.
And the health insurers
to compete for business aren't competing
for us, they're competing with
HR departments. So they're offering
a set of things that keep HR
departments happy.
One of the end results is those
of us who have it,
when we pay for our treatment,
we're cut off from
any kind of financial
decision. Unfortunately
in my family I've gone through a bunch of
catastrophic illnesses
recently, a few
cancers and stuff, and I was really
thinking about this. That obviously
with my family, I want
them to live, I want them to have the
best possible treatment. But just because
I'm an economics reporter,
I would explore how
minor shifts in decision making
for equally good treatment
could mean the difference in
hundreds of thousands of dollars spent.
But if I wasn't actively
pursuing that information, it never
would have come up because
that was completely opaque to
us. And so
you get into a big
issue, you know, some people do
believe health cares are right and people shouldn't have
to think about money, but
we do know from economics
that if that's the case, then the
price will continue to rise dramatically.
So I don't think anybody or very few
people think we should have a system where
everyone just pays a la carte. I mean, there should clearly
be some risk pooling,
but
there are a variety of ways you can do it
where we experience the
economic signal without
being overburdened
by it. And it just gets to the point of
how important the
cost of something is in sending
a signal. And that's the thing that is
totally missing in health care. You don't
know. You don't know. The person
who's experiencing it doesn't know. And then it
goes through the insurance
company, which is going to the employer.
So there's sort of three steps
between the signal. The signal
gets muddy. It goes from the hospital
to the insurance company to the employer to you. And by
the time it gets, you know, that
circuit is just very, very muddy. So
it doesn't get communicated back like that's too expensive.
You don't even know how much is too expensive. So
the incentive for everybody is to sort of just
like raise the cost. Oh, and by the way,
everyone's fine. The cancer? Yeah,
yeah. Just so you know.
So they were treated
well.
One of the things I value
about Planet Money is not only that when
you explain the U.S. economy, but when
you go abroad. And I'm thinking of
stories like on the Spanish banking crisis
or the Iceland referendum.
And so I was wondering, you
spoke a lot about the U.S. today, and
I was wondering if you could kind of
look at the opposite side. And
to what extent do you feel that
when you look at the global economy
that the things, the problems we have
here are out of our control?
What things do you look at outside of the
U.S. where you feel like this is something
that other countries have a real
impact on, impact on
how the U.S. is going to be going forward?
Yeah. I mean,
I think most of the things,
leaving aside global warming,
which is obviously an impossible
thing to leave aside. But that's
so big, I'm not sure how to account
for that. But I feel like generally
the rest of the world getting wealthier is
good for us. I don't think there's
any debate about that.
More people who can sell
stuff to, more people who can sell stuff
to. That's
the more disposable income there is
in the world that's better for everybody.
So, yeah, and the view
that I get, Antoine Van Ackmal
is here a friend of mine who
coined the term emerging economies
and is a very important guy in
emerging economic finance.
You know, he's helped me
understand and others have helped me understand.
This is,
when you look out 30 years from now,
when there's a Brazil
that's as rich, that's richer than we
are today, an India that's richer than we are
today. When basically
much more of the world is a lot more like
us today, we'll probably still be
richer, but that's a better
world. That's a politically more stable
world, there's more compromise.
But getting from here to there
means we do become a smaller,
you know, we're still probably
the dominant player for a while, but
we lose some power. Other people
who aren't used to having power
start stretching their muscles
and some countries that
maybe aren't too into having a lot
of power do have a lot of power.
So it's a bumpy
ride, probably, as we've
noticed, but
the end destination should be
a much better one. Alright, I'm so
sorry, but thank you guys so much.
