Crazy Eddie's gonna save you a blizzard of bucks on TV's, VCR's, anything and everything in TV and video!
Remember, we are not undersold, we will not be undersold, we cannot be undersold, and we mean it!
It's Crazy Eddie's Christmas in August, TV and video, blow out, blitz!
See, Crazy Eddie now, his prices are INSANE!
My radio, believe me, I like it loud. I'm the man with the box that can rock the crowd.
Walkin' down the street to the hardcore beat while my JVC vibrates the concrete, I'm sorry.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Jacob Goldstein.
And I'm David Kestenbaum, today is Tuesday, July 5th, and that was radio DJ Jerry Carroll,
you heard at the top in the 1980s ad for Crazy Eddie's.
On the show today, we are going to teach you how to launder money, how to cheat on your taxes, and how to deceive shareholders.
But first, of course, the Planet Money Indicator.
Today's Planet Money Indicator is two.
The economic recovery in the U.S. is now two years old.
Should we say happy birthday?
Well, it's not really that happy, and I actually missed it a little bit, the recovery started back in June of 2009,
so if you want to be technical, its second birthday was last month.
I can understand why you missed it though, because a recovery doesn't really mean you're booming ahead,
it just means that we passed the bottom, or they think we passed the bottom, right?
You're slowly climbing.
And in the case of this recovery, really slowly climbing.
You know, the economy, it has been adding jobs over the past two years,
but barely, not even fast enough to keep up with population growth.
And GDP, yeah, GDP is rising, but it's rising about half as fast as it has been in previous economic recoveries.
And, you know, like we've talked about before, there is still this great big overhang of debt,
especially mortgage debt that the country has to deal with.
And that debt burden, I think as much as anything, is this weight that's going to keep pressing down on the recovery,
really for the foreseeable future.
I'm going to celebrate the fifth birthday.
The fifth birthday maybe will really be fired up about the recovery.
Now it is time to go inside the mind of a financial criminal.
Jacob, did you hear about crazy eddies when you were growing up?
Yeah, I think so.
I grew up on the West Coast, but I remember like crazy Eddie was the guy who would like go on the radio and scream about his deals or something.
Right, right, that thing you heard at the top.
So the guy in those ads is actually radio announcer Jerry Carroll.
And we should say, since we're talking about crimes here, that Jerry Carroll had no part in the illegal activities of crazy eddies, which were many.
He was just the public face of the company.
Anyway, crazy eddies was the name of this chain of electronics stores in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
And it turns out that people running crazy eddies were doing a lot of really crazy illegal things.
The U.S. attorney at the time, Michael Chertoff, called Eddie Antar of crazy eddies the Darth Vader of capitalism.
So Adam Davidson and I here talked to a key member of crazy Eddie's operation, Sam Antar, who cooked the books for the entire family.
And I got to say, he seemed proud of his bit as a bad guy.
Convicted felon, former criminal chief financial officer of crazy eddies.
It was a really great interview. So Antar says crazy eddies was crooked from the very, very start.
They were just crooked on a smaller scale.
And like a lot of small businesses, he says, they didn't always pay their sales tax.
From 1969 to 1980, our primary fraud was skimming and stealing sales tax.
I mean, sales taxes is a license to steal.
You collect the money for the New York State sales tax department.
You skim off the not only skim off the profits, but you also skim off that 8 percent sales tax,
which is more than most of the operating income of most companies.
In fact, there's a joke around the New York State sales tax department.
If you eliminate the sales taxes, half the mom and pops in New York will be out of business.
It turns out it's really, really simple to hide how much money you make from the government.
You just don't deposit the money in the bank.
You keep a good chunk of your profits and then the government has no way of knowing.
And so they did this for a while and it worked really, really well.
But eventually they had a problem.
We have the money in the mattresses, the basements, all over.
I mean, we have money everywhere.
There's millions of dollars, you know, whatever.
Eventually you want to do something with the money because cash doesn't earn interest.
And in those days, interest rates are relatively high.
So this is where they go from skimming taxes to actually full on like international fraud and money laundering.
Sam says they found this crooked guy at Bank Leumi, the Israeli bank.
And basically what they do is Sam's cousins would fill huge briefcases with cash.
He said he's actually, Sam Antar is an expert.
You can show him any size bag and he could tell you exactly how much money could fit in that bag.
And they would deposit the money in Bank Leumi in Tel Aviv.
And then, and David, I got to admit, I don't fully understand all the details, although it's very, very confusing.
But somehow they would use the money at the branch in Israel to get the Bank Leumi branch in New York to lend the money at favorable rates.
And there was some tax thing involved.
Did you understand it, David?
No, but it made me realize it was actually pretty hard to be a money launderer.
It's very complicated.
But then they moved in a different direction that is clear and big and easy to understand.
They're big, big scam, which is a stock scam.
And to understand this, there's just two things you need to understand.
One is, you know, these are, as Sam Antar described it, these are a bunch of guys who live in Brooklyn, not the heights of education.
And basically, Crazy Eddie told his nephew Sam, you've got to get educated.
We need someone in this family who really understands finance so that we can be more ambitious in our scams.
So he sent Sam Antar to college.
And then what Sam came up with was the idea that they would take the company public and they would artificially
increase the market value of the company by stopping to scam, stopping skimming the taxes.
Right, David?
Yeah. So it was this great idea.
They were going to they had all this sales off the books.
They were going to slowly bring it back on the book.
So it would look like increased profits.
Hey, more business, more business every year.
Even though they're making the same amount of money, they're just officially making more and more and more.
At the time I was going to college, I was training to be a CPA.
I had more financial sophistication.
I understood more about how the markets work from just reading the Wall Street Journal from when I was 12 years old.
Now it's around 1979, 1980.
Actually, at the time I graduated college around 1980, 1981, and I had much more financial sophistication.
I said, this is the way the markets work.
So did you sit down your uncles and give them a presentation?
Yes, my cousins.
Yeah, we sat at the kitchen table 2146 East 3rd Street in Brooklyn at his old house.
Okay, so you did go public?
Yeah, we go public in 1984.
Success.
Now, there's no incentive to skim.
There's no incentive to steal the sales tax.
Because you guys are majority shareholders.
Right. We own all of the stock.
The Antoff family owns all of the stock.
And when you sell the stock based upon inflated profits as opposed to deflated profits from skimming,
you make even more money and you only pay capital gains.
And are you guys all selling stock all the time?
Yeah, the Antars, well, I was not the immediate family.
I didn't have the same amount of stock that they did.
So, but they sold about a hundred million dollars worth of stock for about over three years.
Ninety hundred million dollars.
And how much would that really be worth if there was proper valuation?
Well, if we were crooks from day one, it was never worth anything.
You can't take a crooked company public.
So I will go from ground zero.
This company was never worth anything.
Can I ask a question?
Go ahead.
So just to understand this strategy, this is your brilliant business strategy, which
is we've been hiding all these profits.
We're now going to start to bring them on the books.
So it's going to look like our profits are going up and up and up.
And then we're going to go public.
And because the profits in the past years have been going up and up and up, people
are going to overvalue the stock because they think it's going to keep going up and
up.
Right, because they see the growth curve.
Wall Street is based upon expectation.
It's not based upon today's earnings.
It's based upon the expectations of earnings one, two, three, four years down the road.
You can have two companies with the same profit, same exact income statement, same
exact balance sheet, twin split at the egg.
But one company will be valued more depending upon its growth potential.
Right.
So that is your plan.
You're going to go public based on this false history of increasing sales.
The price of the stock will be much higher than it ought to be.
And you're going to own a bunch of the stock because you own the company and you're
going to start to sell that at more than it's worth.
Yes, it pays to go legit so you can commit your next crime.
So we should be aware of any company that's making profits.
You should be aware of any company that doesn't have a hiccup.
You should be aware because the road to success has its bumps.
The road to success is usually two steps forward, one step back, three steps forward,
four steps back, five steps forward.
When you see a smooth road to success, chances are there's something wrong.
Did you think about that?
Did you think we ought to have a down year?
No, because we criminals don't think in those terms.
We have this heightened sense of heightened sense of accomplishment of of confidence.
We don't think in those terms.
All right. So so you only had what four or five years of this triumph of this hundreds
of millions of dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't tell you about the next scam.
Oh, OK. No, no, please.
Now. All right.
So we're pumping up our profits.
1986 comes along.
We're in our last quarter.
Wall Street expects a five percent revenue increase in something called same store
sales. That's sales and stores that are open during two similar accounting periods
factoring out new store openings.
In other words, how much of base sales store growth do you have?
And we were running five percent going into the end of February, OK,
which is our fiscal year ended on March 2nd, 1986.
And Wall Street expected 10 percent.
And Eddie and his father wanted to sell a lot of stock,
and they felt that if there was a disappointment in our revenue figure,
the stock would go down.
They get less value.
Here in cool is called the Panama pump.
We take the money from Israel.
We wire it to Bank Lyumi Panama, two separate bank secrecy jurisdictions to create
a layer.
Now, how do you bring the money into the United States and not run afoul of the
currency laws?
At that time, if you brought in cash in the United States, more than ten thousand
dollars, you have to fill out a squeal form, you know, that I brought in cash.
Now, criminals have no problem lying on it, but you always try to reduce your
risks if you can, just like in your business.
OK, if you bring in checks into the United States, that's a negotiable
instrument.
You can't bring it because that too you have to fill out the squeal form.
But what we do is we bring it in in the form of bank drafts.
A check says pay to the order of.
The words to the order of makes a check negotiable and subject to various
restrictions and subject to various disclosures.
But a bank draft says pay to.
A check can be negotiated to a third party, endorse the back of it, etc.
A bank draft cannot.
So we legally bring in the money that we had skimmed overseas to pump
up our sales and our profits.
In other words, we take previous money that we stole from the company
and we give a little bit back so we can sell stock at high prices and make it
back that way.
And you brought this new money in deposit in your account said, wow, we
made a lot of money.
It was, you know, it is.
I'll tell you what the problem with auditors.
They saw that the money was in the bank and they said, OK, the money
is in the bank.
The revenues are there, but they didn't look to see how the revenues got
there later on.
An act was passed called the Sarbanes Oxley Act.
Wonderful act, maybe not strong enough, which which reformed corporate
governance and made the auditors more accountable.
The auditors were forced to look at internal controls more seriously.
You see this case is here in substance.
The money is there.
So how did it get there had to be a sale.
These guys wouldn't put the money in but internal control evaluation
means how did the money get there?
The auditors never looked to see how the money got there.
All right.
How did how did how did this all end?
Well, it all ended.
It's got to go back.
I got to go back to day one to tell you how it all ended.
Originally crazy days was ERS electronics, Eddie, Ronnie and Sam.
Ronnie was the cousin.
Well, Ronnie doesn't have the staying power and Eddie buys out Ronnie
Gindi and Eddie owns two-thirds of crazy Eddie's which becomes from
sights and sounds to crazy Eddie's and his father owns one-third,
but his father owned a lot of other businesses and his father was
the patriarch of the Antar family and the father didn't mind that
Eddie owned two-thirds of the small little dinky one-store retail
operation because he had other things but as crazy Eddie's grows
Eddie's stature rises and he becomes the de facto head of the
Antar family.
He was a handsome guy very very, you know, he was a great
speaker, great leader and his father and his brothers grow
jealous of Eddie's success.
So David, this is when it just the family drama.
It was actually I found it truly painful to hear Antar
agreed.
It is a despicable family in which father and son brother
and brother cousin and cousin.
They're just backstabbing each other lying to each other
cheating each other.
But for most of the 60's and 70's and into the 80's everyone's
making tons of money and and so every fight is that they
reach peace pretty quickly because they know that they can
all make more money together than if they were all split
apart.
But then by about 1987 it all falls apart because by then
the family had sold pretty much all of its stock and they
didn't have a financial incentive to stick together and
they're all starting to think like God, what if we go to
jail and so they just all turn on each other this time
instead of patching things over Eddie cleans house.
He cleans out his father and his brothers and their allies
he throws them out of the company and what do they do
they get even they're worried that the company may
be taken over because in those days there was a lot
of takeovers and the company people were thinking the company
was undervalued and the family infighting was bringing the
company down.
Nobody knew that on the outside there was a fraud they
were worried that that that a fraud would be uncovered
eventually if the company got taken over and that they
would be blamed by Eddie and I so they send two
witnesses to the United States Attorney's Office as
a front and they talk about the frauds minus their
side of the family and they don't talk about any of the
skimming from before we were a public company because
that would implicate both sides.
So these two witnesses lie to the federal government
for two years after our fraud is uncovered when we
lose control. These two witnesses being your uncles.
No no two witnesses two non-family witnesses they
were associated with that side of the family.
I see so so let me so what happens is there a day
a pivotal day or suddenly.
Yeah 1989 I find Eddie and I find that we've been
set up and Eddie is getting ready to go to Israel
because the criminals don't play by the rules,
but the government has to they have to provide documents
discovery civil litigants have to whatever and we
get their evidence because we destroy ours.
We never give out anything.
We don't give ice in the winter is crux.
But anyway, we find out that we've been set up
Eddie gets Eddie separates myself from me is
getting ready to bolt and here I am one side
of the family rats me and Eddie out there my
mentor.
I mean he was 10 years older than me when I
started working crazy as I was 14 my mentor the
guy that I worship he's bolting on me.
So what do I do?
I cooperate with the feds in 1989 at first they
thought that their witnesses were telling the
truth and I was lying eventually the government
realizes their two initial witnesses gave them a
Trojan horse.
They indict one the other one.
I don't know what happened to but they don't
use those two witnesses again,
and I become the government's main
witness in the crazy Eddie investigation.
Did you do any time?
No, I got six months house arrest 1200 hours
community service 10,000 in fines.
I had to pay the SEC $20,000 from for
selling stock at inflated prices.
Actually, I lost money ultimately lost money on
my crazy a stock,
but I should have lost more money because it was
worth less than what I sold it for and I the
civil plaint the people the victims because I
cooperated them and showed them where all the
bodies were buried.
They gave me a complete civil walk.
I walked away from crazy.
He's with with basically basically unscathed.
Who did go to jail Eddie Antle went to
jail for seven years his brother Mitchell went
to jail for two years his brother Alan was
acquitted in the criminal case,
but the real story is in the civil case
brought by the SEC in the civil plaintiffs
for five more years after the criminal trial in
1993 to the SEC and the civil plaintiffs
the class-action lawyers pursued the Antle
family money at all ends of the earth.
They were able to recover more money than
the Antle's actually made on the securities
fraud because of the previous skimming.
How's the Antle family?
Are you guys do you all get together for
Passover?
No, they hate me.
They hate you because you ratted them out.
Yeah, I ratted them out.
Yeah.
What did you learn?
What did I learn?
I learned that it's easier to talk about
crime to teach people about crime than it
is to commit crime.
It's more fun being on the other side
than committing it and taking all the risk.
But the fascination with crime still
remains the same.
Crime really doesn't pay.
In the end, you're going to get caught.
But watching your demeanor you enjoy
talking about this.
As I said I says I enjoy it's easier to
talk about it and to teach others about
you know because I trained the I trained
the Secret Service.
I've trained the FBI the Securities
and Exchange Commission basically every
three-letter agency that you know of and
some that you'll never hear of in the
United States government the Internal
Revenue Service Criminal Division.
I've gone to colleges and universities.
I teach about white collar crime.
But it's easier to teach people about
the effects and about the criminality
involved in white collar crime than it
is to actually commit the crime.
There's no risk this way.
And what you do is basically what you
did for us.
This is generally how I start out when
we talk about the crazy.
But I do much much more detail how
you money launder what the steps are
that auditors should have taken but
didn't take.
But the most important detail that people
have to understand that white collar crime
is a brutal crime.
It's in many cases more brutal than
violent crime because our crimes
inflict the collective harm on society
actions of one or a few can cause
billions of damages.
Look at the Bernie Madoff case and
people kind of give us a pass like
you're smiling now you two guys
are in the studio with me if I were
a serial killer and telling you
you know how I chopped up dead bodies
wouldn't be laughing about my
techniques would you whatever but we
kind of give the white collar criminal
a pass and there's no reason for it.
If I didn't get caught I could still
be the criminal CFO of crazy Eddie
today.
I was actually going to ask you do
you feel bad about what you did.
It's irrelevant what I feel.
I don't care.
Do you or don't you.
Because here's the educational point.
If I told you I felt bad does
it do anything.
If I told you I felt bad should
you believe it judge people
as a crook that used words to
defraud people right to
misinform people right to lie to
people.
Why should you believe me now
if I tell you that I feel sorry for
my crimes just tell me do you
decide whether I want to believe you
or not.
Well you have to judge me for my
actions I did 11 years of free work
for the United States government
for top educational institutions
whatever judge me by my actions not
by my words.
Why don't you say it though
because it is against the criminal
it's against the former criminal
vocabulary as I said I feel sorry
for my crimes now do you believe
me.
I don't want to I don't want to
play a violin of redemption.
It doesn't do anything.
Apologies are meaningless people
I saw Bernie Madoff was going
up to the I was on Fox business
channel and I was commenting as
Bernie Madoff was making his
apology.
This is the only reason when I
made my apology I really felt
that was only felt bad that I
got caught.
What is what it was what's the
relevance of an apology.
How does Bernie Madoff or any
criminals apology help any
victim.
I'm not asking you to apologize.
I'm just curious in your head
how you feel.
I feel bad about it.
Yes I do.
I do feel guilty about it.
