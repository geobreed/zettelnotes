New York investment manager Bernard Madoff stands accused in a $50 billion Ponzi scheme at his firm. As Felix Salmon of Portfolio explains, Madoff wasn't running a hedge fund. But in hindsight, things might have turned out better that way.

**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**

They invested their money with Madoff in some cases, all of their money, tens of millions
of dollars, which apparently he was taking, purporting to be getting 10, 15 percent returns
on their money when in fact he had lost all of it.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
It's about 3.35 p.m. on Monday, December 15th, here in New York, where everyone is just
absolutely fascinated with this tale of Bernie Madoff.
I know.
I definitely am.
It's on all the front pages everywhere.
And our theme this week so happens to be the mysterious world of hedge funds.
Now for those of you not obsessively reading the Wall Street Journal, like we are here
at Planet Money, we're on this theme of hedge funds because of this shocking story.
Bernard Madoff is the 70-year-old investment manager who really has been the very definition
of respectability and trust, just seen as the most solid of solid Wall Street investors.
Until last week, according to reports, he allegedly fest to his sons and then
his sons called the FBI.
He said that he has been running a giant Ponzi scheme that has lost something like
$50 billion.
More on that in a little bit.
Let's start first, Adam, with just a Planet Money indicator, OK?
All right.
Let's go somewhere totally different.
Today's indicator is $30.6 million.
Tell me which.
That is how much that today, Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said he will
not pay to those people who hold Ecuadorian government bonds.
Really?
Yeah.
This is a big deal.
This is very rare.
They call it a sovereign default when a government says, we are not going to pay
our debt.
It almost never happens because it's basically screaming to the world, hey, don't invest
your money in Ecuador.
We are not trustworthy.
It actually has a ripple effect.
Investors start looking at countries kind of like Ecuador.
Venezuela, Argentina, places with similar governments, similar financial structures,
and it's harder for them to get money, especially at a time like this when investors are so
nervous.
But Ecuador has money.
They've got all this oil money, right?
So why is he going to cause this trouble?
Yeah.
They have something like $2 billion in the bank.
They clearly could write a check for $30.6 million.
That's not a big deal.
But my understanding is this is really about politics, that Correa has, who by the way
studied economics in the U.S., he has presented himself to the Ecuadorian people as an ally
of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, as a leftist who's going to stick it to the Yankee imperialists.
And so this is a way to sort of tell his crowd, his audience, and he's facing
re-election, hey, see what I'll do?
I'll mess them up.
The thing that makes this a tragedy though, and I do, I think tragedy is not too strong.
I mean, Ecuador is a poor country and, you know, I'm not saying every foreign investor
is like doing everything in the right way, but foreign investment is one of the only
ways for very poor countries to become slightly less poor countries or even middle
class countries.
And this just makes it that much more difficult for Ecuador to get any money from overseas.
And you know, if this truly is, and we'll keep an eye on it, if it truly is just a
political stunt, you know, it is, it makes your stomach hurt.
It doesn't seem nice.
Okay.
From that particular tragedy to a little bit of some homegrown absurdity or maybe
absurd tragedy.
I don't know.
Bernie Madoff.
Yeah.
So, Laura, you've been cautioning me all day long, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly,
he has not been found guilty in a court of law.
But so one thing that struck me as kind of nutty on the face of it is how did
a guy run around convincing lots and lots of very wealthy, very sophisticated people
to give him billions of dollars that he sort of squandered.
It occurred to me that for people who don't know the world of New York hedge funds,
which I've gotten to know a little bit, it's helpful to kind of set the stage to
help us understand the world that Bernie Madoff comes from.
One of the things you have to know about hedge funds that you've been teaching
me, Adam, is that you might think a hedge fund is all about hedging, but they're
not, right?
Right.
This is one of the big misnomers with hedge funds.
I think some of the big first ones were the idea was you hedge your risk so that
if you have a lot of money in, you know, financial stocks, you have some hedge.
But most hedge funds are not about hedging.
It's just really a legal entity.
It's a term for a kind of management firm.
We actually brought in Felix Salmon, who's the fabulous financial
blogger at Portfolio.com, to walk us walk us through.
Basically, what Felix told us is that, you know, if you and I, I don't have five
million dollars, my understanding is you don't.
No, that's a good guess, Adam.
Right. So a hedge fund is a financial management company that is only open to
people with at least five million dollars to invest.
In other words, the government is saying, poor schmucks like you and me,
Laura and Adam, who don't have five million, the government really needs to
protect us because we could have all our money stolen by, you know,
cheaters or something.
So we can only go to places like Fidelity or Vanguard or, you know,
Bank of America or whatever.
And those institutions that serve us, the great unwashed, have a lot of
government regulation, a lot of oversight.
They're very carefully watched.
A hedge fund, the very idea is the only people investing there are so rich
that they could lose their money.
So they're very much unregulated.
They are.
I mean, basically, when you hear hedge fund, you should think that is an
unregulated money manager, no more, no less.
And anyone can open a hedge fund, as I say.
The difficult thing is persuading people to invest in you and with you.
And if you look at the histories of most of the biggest hedge funds, most
of them started off with literally investments from family and friends.
You know, you'd go to your rich uncle or, you know, your family lawyer or your
family dentist, a bit like Warren Buffett did actually back in the early days.
And you got the people you know and you said, hey, listen, I want to
invest this money on your behalf.
And nowadays, such people generally have $5 million because there's so
many rich people, especially around the northeastern United States where
most of the hedge funds are.
And you find a few people with enough money to be able to invest in hedge
funds and you start off with a few million bucks and you just grow
from there.
And for the customers, because here's the other interesting thing.
I mean, I have, you know, just your standard 401k or in my case,
403b mutual funds.
I have some of my own other mutual funds.
I get Fidelity and stuff and I get as often as I want.
I can see exactly how much money I have in that account.
I can see exactly what low cost index funds I own.
I can change those to another one whenever I feel like it.
If I were to invest my money in a hedge fund, it's a very different experience.
You're not logging on to a website and seeing exactly where your money is
because the hedge fund has a secret sauce.
And if they told you their secret sauce, if they told you their secret
trading strategy in great detail, you could just copy it or you could
tell someone at another hedge fund about it.
Hedge funds don't only invest in nice liquid things like stocks.
Your mutual funds, what they do is they invest in stocks.
And one of the markets which has actually worked reasonably well during
this financial crisis has been the stock market.
You can pretty much name any halfway big stock and there will be a price for it.
And you can get that price for it today.
You can go into the market and you can buy at that price.
You can sell at that price.
It's a market clearing price.
Hedge funds invest in all manner of weird and wonderful and
opaque and illiquid instruments.
And you don't know what the price is.
Even if the hedge fund was perfectly happy telling you exactly what it
invested in, it wouldn't be at all obvious how much those things were worth.
You're talking about credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations,
interest rate swaps, on and on and on.
I mean all sorts of- Or just loans, companies.
Private equity firms and hedge funds are not that far apart.
They have a very similar fee structure.
But let's say I'm a hedge fund or a private equity fund and I buy
Hilton hotels.
And then you're like, well, so how much is my investment worth today
compared to how much was it worth yesterday or the month before?
You know, you basically have to pull a number out of thin air for that one
because it's the value of the equity in Hilton hotels.
And because there's no publicly traded market in that, you don't know what-
There's no easy way of coming up with a number for that.
Okay.
So I'm listening to Felix Salmon and I'm thinking, you are giving
your money to someone and you have no idea what they're doing with it.
You just hope that you're going to get some money back every so often
during the year?
That's it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
That is what is so weird.
I mean there are some hedge funds that are pretty open.
They'll send you a statement like Fidelity does or TIA Creft does.
But others are completely secretive.
I mean absolutely secretive.
You give them $30 million and they just send you a check once a year or
four times a year and they don't tell you anything about how you make money.
That's amazing.
It is amazing and it's a big part of New York wealth.
It's a big part of California wealth and Florida wealth.
You know, if you're really, really rich, part of your life is like a buddy of
yours at the club or someone you work with or someone you went to law school
with will call you up and say, oh man, have I got a sweet deal with
this hedge fund, you should put $30 million in.
And a lot of times you call and the hedge fund says, no,
we don't want your money.
So people fight for the right to give money to someone like Madoff.
So does this mean that all hedge funds are basically like Madoff is accused of
being, they're just stealing money?
Absolutely not.
I mean, there is a protection there.
There's not a huge amount of protection, but there is a protection
because pretty much as far as we know, every hedge fund, pretty much everyone
except for Madoff's, Madoff's was the one exception.
Pretty much every hedge fund that we know of.
When they place an investment, they do it through an intermediary.
They don't directly buy stocks and bonds or Chinese shoe factories or whatever.
They call a primary broker, a desk at Goldman Sachs or
JP Morgan at another institution.
And that forces them to at least be a bit honest about how much money they have.
Everything that hedge funds do goes through banks, ultimately, regulated banks.
And the banks look after the hedge funds money and you have these big auditors and
the banks are lending the hedge funds money day in and day out.
And they won't lend the hedge fund money unless the hedge fund actually has
all of the assets to borrow against.
And hedge funds are very closely scrutinized by the banks.
And the banks are very closely scrutinized by the bank regulators.
And so it's very hard for a hedge fund to be a fraud.
Whereas Bernie-
Wait, wait, let me just, I just want to make sure that's crystal clear,
because this is such a crucial point that you've really brought to my attention.
Any normal hedge fund, whatever their strategy is, whether it's buying Russian
bonds and selling Chinese shoe factories or whatever it is, they themselves
don't call Russia and say, can I have some bonds and then call China and
say, let me sell it.
They use an intermediary, usually an investment bank back when there were
investment banks.
And those intermediaries are called prime brokers.
Prime brokers.
And the banks make lots and lots of money from what's known as their
prime brokerage operations.
And so that is a crucial check on the recklessness of a hedge fund.
There has to be some other outside institution like Goldman Sachs
acting on their behalf.
And if they're totally lying or nuts, Goldman Sachs is going to say,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't want to have anything to do with this.
Put it this way, if I go up to Goldman Sachs and say,
buy me a million shares of IBM, they'll say, sure.
And they'll go out and they will take my money and
buy a million shares of IBM.
But if I don't have any money, they won't do that.
Right, okay, that's a much simpler way to put it.
Okay, so Bernie Madoff did not call Goldman Sachs.
Bernie Madoff had the great advantage of owning his own investment house,
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities.
And all of the investments that he made on behalf of his clients
were traded through his own investment house.
So there was no second pair of eyes looking at this.
And if he turned up to, and if he told his investors that he'd done something,
they just had to take it on his word.
They didn't know that there was any prime broker who was lending to him,
who was looking at what he was doing.
They did know that his results were audited.
It turns out they were audited by one man and
his dog in the tie-dye t-shirt in New City, New York, who doesn't ever turn up for work.
Yeah, that's an incredible, incredible story.
That just, that one aspect I love.
Someone hired a private investigator to say, wait, who is auditing him?
And it literally was one man at a talk who never showed up for work.
So, okay, so when we describe the hedge fund universe,
and Bernie Madoff is not technically a hedge fund.
Right, now the hedge funds, remember that the hedge funds can do many
things which you and I can't.
We can invest in stocks really easily, but if we want to invest in bonds, it's hard.
If we want to invest in, say, private equity, it's almost impossible.
If we want to invest in CDO's Squares and CPDOs and
all other weird, opaque, and wonderful financial instruments, forget about it.
For that, to be able to buy the full panoply of financial instruments which
are available to hedge funds, you need to be what's known as a qualified
institutional buyer, like a hedge fund.
And so there are lots of things which hedge funds can buy, which you and I cannot.
And one of the things which hedge funds can buy, which you and I could not,
was investing in, well, investing with Bernie Madoff.
A lot of hedge funds placed their money with Bernie Madoff.
And those hedge funds would charge fees to their investors.
And the investors were perfectly happy to pay fees,
because Bernie Madoff was providing incredibly reliable returns.
And amazingly, and weirdly, and uniquely, and incomprehensibly,
Bernie Madoff was not charging any kind of management fee for this.
He said, you know what, I'll do this just because it's a strategy which
involves lots of trading, and I'll make my money off commissions.
The charge is that Madoff was taking money, and he was telling everyone he
was investing it in some way or another.
And there was nobody who could figure out what he was doing,
because he ran his own trading operation.
It was a closed loop, the whole thing.
The whole thing was a loop.
There was no one outside of his little loop to look in on him.
In fact, according to the reports, he had this one auditor who really was
one guy in his flip flops, and a lot of really, really smart,
but apparently fairly gullible investors, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.
And you asked Felix a really crucial question, I thought.
If, indeed, $50 billion sort of went away, where did it go?
The way the Ponzi schemes work is that the money coming in,
new investments, is being used to pay the notional interest payments
or gains which are being made to the existing investors.
And that's what he's accused of doing.
And that's exactly, he allegedly admitted to his sons
that that was what he had been doing all along.
That the money went out almost as fast as it went in,
because although people were investing with him the whole time,
he then needed to use their money to pay the people who thought
that they were earning millions of dollars on their tens of millions
of dollars of investments.
In fact, that tens of millions of dollars didn't exist,
and the money they were getting as checks every year
was coming straight from the new investors who were coming into his sons.
It's already sort of steamed off the kettle.
Exactly.
But it did go.
I mean, the point is that he himself,
while he clearly profited to some insane degree,
he himself did not take all the $50 billion
or whatever it turns out to be.
We still have a lot to learn.
He was paying money out to clients.
Yes, any time you wanted to redeem money from Bernie Madoff,
he would give it to you immediately, no questions asked,
until $7 billion worth of investors all
wanted to redeem their money at once.
And that was when the smash came.
That sort of breaks the chain when a bunch of people
come forward and say, give us our money.
Any one person could redeem, no problem.
But when $7 billion worth of people all ask for their money
at once, he didn't have that money.
So in this scenario, who loses?
The newest comers to the investment fund?
Yes.
And it's entirely possible that anyone who has made gains
or has taken money out from Bernie Madoff in the past
might be asked to give some of that money back.
