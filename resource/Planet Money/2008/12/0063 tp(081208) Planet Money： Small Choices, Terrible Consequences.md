Small decisions by consumers and companies are reshaping the economy we live in. Eric Hansen, a clothing distributor, says these days even people who have money and jobs aren't spending. Hansen's orders have been drastically cut. This week, he's selling stock for cheap in a Manhattan sample sale.

I think it is important for us to make sure that moving forward, any economic plan that
we put in place helps businesses to meet payroll so that we're not seeing these kinds
of circumstances again.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway. This is Monday, December 8th. It's about 4.58 p.m. here in New York
City. Today we're kicking off a new theme. It's about the terrible consequences of small
choices.
We are going to be talking about how lots and lots of people making small choices,
minor choices, maybe I'll invest in this instead of that, maybe I'll put off buying
a suit jacket for another few weeks, can add up to huge, huge problems like a recession
that we're going to be looking at all this week, including a special look today at the
impact on the world of fashion.
Adam, first of all, can you give us a Planet Money indicator?
My indicator today is 1936.
That is the year that John Maynard Keynes wrote his magnum opus, The General Theory
of Employment Interest in Money. I've been trying to crack it and read it now because
yesterday with President-elect Barack Obama announcing a massive, or well, announcing
plans to hope for a massive government spending plan to kickstart this economy,
Planet Money's Alex Bloomberg and I have been saying, is Keynesianism back? People
said that John Maynard Keynes, who's sort of the economist, the theoretician to come
out of the Great Depression, a man who many people thought, you know, his ideas
were kind of beaten up and left for dead in the late 70s, his influence seems to
have had a huge resurgence, so that's going to be something we're going to be
looking a lot at. John Maynard Keynes and why he matters now and is President-elect
Barack Obama. Alex Bloomberg had a really interesting idea, which maybe he'll be bad
at me for being the first one to say, but he's like, maybe this is the first Keynesian
president because FDR, who's so closely associated with Keynes, was not a Keynesian.
In fact, FDR's biggest decisions happened before Keynes wrote his magnum opus.
So is Barack Obama the first fully Keynesian? Well, I don't know. We'll look into all
of that, but that's our indicator for today.
I want to get in there at some point and look at the disagreement among economists
about whether FDR's plans actually saved the country during the Great Depression
or made the Great Depression longer. This is a very hotly debated issue right
now and a fascinating one. I mean, I think all of us grew up with a
relatively simplistic, can I say, idea that, you know, FDR came to power in
1933, solved all the world's problems through his forceful actions, and I
heard a wonderful interview with Eric Roushway, friend of Planet Money, but I
heard the interview on Econ Talk, which is another great podcast, and he really
laid out what a complicated mix of good economics and bad economics and
politics and backscratching FDR's plans were. Anyway, that's for another
day, though. I want to just mention a few quick news items.
You know, Wall Street seems to love the idea that President-elect Obama
plans to spend a fortune.
Caterpillar stock went up.
Even GM and Ford went up.
Also on news that Congress is very close to a $15 billion auto bailout.
This is not everything Detroit wanted, for sure, and we'll try and get
more on that. Tribune Company filing for bankruptcy.
This is for a lot of our friends.
It's bad news.
Yeah. Around the country and the newspaper business, it's very upsetting,
not terribly surprising.
I was interested that John Thain of Merrill Lynch was rumored to be
demanding $10 million bonus, even though this is the worst year ever for
Merrill Lynch and the company almost went out of business.
I'm going to try that.
Although, you know, I did see one thing that said his argument was,
hey, it would have been a lot worse without me.
At least the company still exists, although it's being sold, but he
will not get that bonus.
He met with the board and they said, no, you don't get it.
So last week, we asked for your stories about choices you've been making in
this troubled economy.
How have you changed your spending habits, your saving habits, your
hiring habits, if you're in a position to hire people, your job
looking habits, whatever.
So we're going to be playing tape from some of your responses and
blogging them at npr.org slash money.
The first up is a woman named Bronwyn Stein, who lives in Brooklyn.
She works in Manhattan and she turns out to be kind of a lot like
me, at least, Adam, with regard to her pocketbook.
There's a little bit of a point of pride when I, if I can come home on
Friday and say, you know what, I didn't, I didn't spend anything while
I was doing my normal routine.
I didn't, I didn't spend cash.
You know, I bought groceries that week and of course it paid my
mortgage and I paid the utilities and whatnot.
But I do feel kind of good if I haven't spent anything.
Bronwyn Stein so happens to be a long lost friend from when our kids used
to play together on the same playground in the park.
We figured that out about halfway through the interview.
That's funny.
I would think if I knew a Bronwyn Stein, I would know.
You'd remember that.
Yeah, I never knew her last name.
So she is the kind of person who is, well, let's just call a spade a spade.
She, like you, is the kind of person who's destroying the U.S. economy.
We are responsible, yes.
Yes, it's very frustrating.
And one person she's driving crazy is our next guest.
Everyone in our office and actually in our entire office
building has been all abuzz.
So this morning I was saying to everyone on Planet Money, I really
want to get scenes from a recession.
I want to find business people who are struggling with the recession.
I was like, all right, I got to figure out how I'm going to find some.
Then I get to the office and our wonderful Agnes, the receptionist
tells me, have you heard about the sale?
It's there's lots of cheap clothes on sale downstairs.
And we went downstairs and I ran into a friend of a friend of mine,
Eric Hansen, who runs Moda America, a wholesaler that sells lots of high
fashion lines like Ungaro and DKNY black label and something I can't
pronounce. Stuff we can't usually get.
And it was really cheap.
We went down there.
It was so cheap.
And he started telling me why he was selling suits for a hundred dollars
and dress shirts for twenty dollars.
And I said, Lord, let's get a microphone.
Let's let's get this on tape in this room.
There are hundreds of suits or dozens anyway, in this room.
There are probably 500 suits overall in our, our showroom.
We have about 3000 units of clothing of stock.
That's only a minor part of what we have in the warehouse.
That we need to sell off.
Let's let's get the prices here because these suits a hundred bucks.
Yeah, the the the our suits are a hundred dollars.
We that is a minor amount above what we what it costs us to make them.
It's it's if you want to know, it probably cost us sixty dollars to make
the suit selling it here for a hundred.
We have to we can't sell it to the retail sector because no one's taking
in any clothing right now.
So I want to just get understand the economics of this.
So every season before every season, what is it like a is it a couple
months before the season?
Five months?
Normally the larger order is placed between six and seven months prior to
ship at the shipping window only for the reason that we need to buy the
fabric and we need to have the product made.
It's normally made in different countries.
So there's all the lead times are involved in the shipping, the shipping
also the transport of the goods back and forth.
So normally is about six months.
So Macy's or Neiman Marcus or whatever will call and will come in and say,
OK, we like this suit, that suit, that suit.
We like those shirts.
We'll order two hundred thousand dollars worth.
Basically, they they have history and they know what what sells well.
You know, what's the first sign?
Is it the first call from a supply from a buyer saying, oh, remember we
said we're going to buy a hundred suits.
We only want 40 suits.
You know, these these buyers can do it in multiple ways.
They can just say, this is what we're doing.
We are not taking in these goods.
And if they don't take in the goods, you're kind of stuck because you need
them and you know that they can't sell it.
So they'll come in and say, you know, we are not buying these goods
or we are cutting down our orders to such and such.
Would you I mean, six months earlier, you would sat down with them
and said, so you're going to take a thousand suits and then they can come
to you later after you've made the suits and say, remember we said
we're going to take a thousand. We're only going to take five hundred.
They can do pretty much whatever they want.
There's no contract that forces them.
There's there's no signing of contracts when you're doing this.
It's like a gentleman's agreement.
I don't know how else to say it.
But basically, you know, when you when you're when you're in the
clothing business, it's basically as if you're renting space
on the floors of the department stores and even the better
independents now, where if you're not selling, they expect you to do something.
They expect you to meet their margins.
They expect you to take goods back.
So it's it's become when the when when the economy falters a bit,
it gets worse and worse where they the way they really are dictating
your your business and whether you're a survivor or not based on their needs.
So how overstocked are you right now?
How much do you have that you need?
You wouldn't normally have on hand.
Yeah, we're probably overstocked.
We're we're a
13 to 14 million dollar company as of last year in the United States.
So we're we are probably overstocked about a million dollars.
So I'm assuming that I mean, that eats through your profit margin.
We we're we're basically all of a sudden because of the October
and November selling in the retail sector, we're basically
it's almost day to day or week to week.
It's kind of scary.
I mean, it's life or death for us here.
Yeah. What happens is that the retailers are getting overstocked with goods.
So they need to trim the goods.
Once they trim goods, it comes back, falls on us.
What do we do with the goods?
We get stuck.
It's how does it you come to work?
I mean, today's Monday.
So you had a weekend. You come to work.
Is it how does this is it once a week you get a cancellation of an order?
Is it every hour you're getting phone calls?
I realize the cancellations and the cutbacks in the order really started
about three weeks ago when people saw their October selling
and they noticed they weren't getting any better.
And in in November, December, they started to cut back
and push their orders to January.
If there's a they have replenishment or if they have goods
that are coming in in December, they push it to January.
That doesn't help us because we need to make money.
And basically, they've really cut back.
They've been cutting back all along for the last six months.
But this is really where they've kind of stopped orders.
And you're get do they call you?
Do they fax you email?
No, these are these are calls or an email or a call.
And is it like, sorry, man, I feel bad.
Or is it just sorry?
Yeah, you know, it's due to the nature of the
let me try to recite one of the emails due to the.
Can we go look at it?
Yeah, do you want to see it?
Yeah, it's really kind of funny.
OK, I know we touched base last week regarding spring
and based upon current and projected near future spring
on nine business conditions.
My management has has revised our tailored clothing
financial plans downward rather dramatically.
So much to the point where we will not be able to take in
all of the goods I reserved for spring on nine season.
Below, you will find a schedule which indicates the styles
qualities and time frame, which I would like to plan to consume them.
Should business conditions improve?
I would like to, of course, expedite the receipts.
If an opportunity should arise and you had a chance to sell the goods,
we are pushing out.
We would fully encourage that.
So that means once again, we're stuck with goods.
You know, basically, they're not going to take it in.
So this particular company booked a thousand units of suits.
One style of 350 pieces, another style of 350 pieces, they're not taking in.
And then the other style of 350 pieces, they're pushing out to the fall.
So basically leaves us in a position, you know, this is happening
with all of our retail partners where if they keep doing this,
this we can't make money.
We can't survive because we have no no place to make money.
If you're not selling goods, then we're done.
This is another funny comment.
Not really funny, but just the word that he used
and which was depression.
So let me I realize this is not good news and news,
which I do not enjoy delivering.
But honestly, I'm asking all of my vendors to make sacrifices
headed into spring with the business seemingly headed
into a prolonged state of depression.
Wow. And we won't say who,
but it's a well-known national large.
Yeah. Well, yeah.
Well-known national department store.
Out of the this is a spreadsheet with your sales.
Yeah, this is a spreadsheet with my sales out of the one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven larger department stores we sell.
One, two, three of them have pushed out orders
to the fall or even later in the spring.
We can't survive with just three of them.
It's hard to pay the bills.
We've let a couple of people go.
May have to let more go.
We have to get a smaller space if we can even continue.
It is not good.
Wow. So how are you?
Do you look at that with your stomach just churning
when you look at that spreadsheet?
I used to look at it every day, but now I don't.
I can't because it just reminds me of how bad things are.
So I just try to get my day to day work done
and get the people here that are in the office
basically excited and try to keep everyone happy.
Try to maintain some resemblance of a positive attitude here,
which is not easy.
Well, thank you to Eric Hanson of Moda America.
I don't know if that sale is still going on, but ...
How many suits did you end up buying, Adam?
Three. Three suits for $300.
My dad came and bought two.
That's pretty good.
Yeah. That's a wrap for Planet Money for today.
Yeah. Let's take our clothes and go home.
Keep in touch with us on the blog, npr.org.
I'm Laura Conaway.
And I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you for listening.
