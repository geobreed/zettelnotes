Listeners have been writing in with their stories of reductions in overall pay — whether in tips, 401k contributions or hourly wages. Economist Howard Rosen of the Peterson Institute considers the bigger picture.

Listeners have been writing in this week about their experiences with falling wages. Now let's dive deeper into what those stories might mean.

Today on Planet Money:

-- Economist Howard Rosen of the Peterson Institute says the actual data on wages is mixed. He's more troubled by signs that the economy is still contracting, with many millions of people unemployed and major manufacturers putting everything on hold.
