**(Adam Davidson):**
Hi, this is NPR's Planet Money Podcast. I'm Adam Davidson here with Laura Conaway.
How you doing?
I'm good. How are you?
I'm okay, I think.
We're giving the time and date this week. It is Thursday, September 25th at 2 14 p.m.
The latest big piece of news that went across the wires about 26 minutes ago is
that it looks like the Democrats and Republicans, the Senate and the House, the Congress and
the White House have reached at least an agreement in principle on a bailout package.
Seven hundred billion dollars.
Seven hundred billion dollars. Presumably by the time you hear this, you will know
more, frankly, than we know right now. So we will leave it at that.
We've gotten a lot of questions and we want more. We really find it very helpful
to know what you are curious about, what you're puzzled about, what you're upset
about. PlanetMoney at NPR dot org. You can also find us at Twitter dot com slash PlanetMoney.
That's us.
Or NPR dot org slash money.
You're going to find us. Andre wants to know, why is it that AIG, Lehman Brothers,
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and so many investment banks are all experiencing bankruptcy
or financial turmoil at the same time? Something smells fishy to me.
So look, Andre, there is something fishy. What's fishy is there is less money
in the world. That is what has happened between 2002 and 2007.
There's what most people now call a housing bubble.
There was a huge explosion and credit being given out.
Home values were going up, which fed a whole virtuous cycle, it's called,
of increased returns for banks and investment banks and insurance companies,
which meant it basically the global economy was pumped up to many more
trillions of dollars than it was before.
Between 2000 and 2007, the global economy doubled in size.
I mean, it's massive what happened.
And now we are watching that giant balloon deflate a bit.
We're nowhere near where we were in 2000, but we have lost trillions of dollars
in the world economy. That is affecting every institution, every business,
every bank in the world, but it's affecting some more than others.
So the places you mentioned, they are all interrelated,
and the impact of one impacts the other.
But basically, they are all victims and also causes of the crisis we're in.
Sounds like an ebbing tide sinks all boats, the big ones, faster.
Yeah, or the shaky ones faster, or the ones that are balancing on a log.
I'm trying to think of some ship analogy for high leverage.
All right, here we go. Everett.
Everett is bang on this business about executive pay.
It seems that we now have some kind of an agreement to curb executive pay
for banks that take advantage of the bailout.
Everett wants to know, you mentioned, we mentioned in a past podcast,
worried that rather than stay at the banks and correct their mistakes,
some executives would leave to pursue other higher paying positions
with different companies.
I know these are not all bad people, but who would have them?
Additionally, what would they be able to negotiate their salary with?
They can't say, if you don't pay me what I want,
then I'll stay where I'm at.
The job market is a market like any other.
It's supply and demand.
If you are one of a handful of people who know how to run a huge,
large corporation, then you are part of a very small group of people.
I don't know that it's a good thing to have on your resume,
that you ran a major bank that collapsed, but I do think that a lot
of these people are very smart, very capable, and there will be many
companies that want them and possibly far more companies that want them
than there are available CEOs.
Just one thing I want to mention, I mean, people talk about greed.
Yeah, it's greed, but it's self-interest.
Let's call it, that's what Adam Smith talked about, self-interest.
Sure, it would be great if people generally thought, you know,
I'm going to take less money and serve the common good.
That doesn't seem to conform to the experience of most of humanity.
More science from Sarah.
I've heard this kind of question a lot.
If this fiscal disaster is a reverse pyramid where you have this narrow base
of faulty mortgages holding up all these credit swaps all over the place,
what if you just stabilize the base?
She says, give five million homeowners who are having trouble
on their mortgages $50,000 each to buy some time and refinance.
Is this pie in the sky?
What are we talking about here?
I mean, I don't know that that is the exact solution that seems
to make the most sense for a variety of reasons.
I mean, first of all, an awful lot of the homeowners foreclosing are,
you know, these were speculators.
These were people who made irresponsible decisions.
Of course, many of the banks that will benefit from this bailout
also made irresponsible decisions.
Either way is very upsetting.
But just giving $50,000, I mean, it starts becoming a very weird thing.
Do you give it to everybody?
Do you give it only to the people who are struggling,
but aren't those the people who took the biggest risks?
So why are the people who didn't take risks not benefiting?
I hate to say it, but it sounds a lot like the bailout itself
where they're choosing which investment firms are going to get
the bad assets wiped off their books and which aren't.
Right.
And we don't know how they're going to do that.
But that's true.
There's going to be very powerful questions no matter what you do.
There are some solutions that seem, at least at first glance,
to provide levels of equity that are higher than the current bailout plan
or than that one, I would think.
For example, I mean, there's one simple idea,
which is just cut the caps on that mutual fund 401k investing.
Just go ahead and the government coming out and saying,
for the next year, you can put as much as you want
into mutual funds and savings accounts,
and we will never tax that money ever.
A Roth IRA is basically what that was called, an uncapped Roth IRA,
to encourage us all to save a lot more money,
which would be healthy for us, healthy for the system,
and it would provide that liquidity, that precious liquidity,
that money moving through the system,
the credit available for people to lend out.
That's one idea that, frankly, I would love that.
And then it allows the market to sort of punish the people
who made risky decisions, both the homeowners and the big banks.
Another idea is the government just buys the homes in foreclosure,
just pays for them, and then rents them out to the owners.
It seems like a very complicated plan,
and I think what Bernanke and Paulson both said is,
we need speed, we don't have time
for the perfect complicated solution.
Danny has a question.
I think it has to do with the idea of oversight.
The $700 billion bailout comes with a lot of power
for the Secretary of the Treasury
to go ahead and buy what he likes to buy,
not buy what he doesn't like to buy.
Danny asks, won't the new president choose his own cabinet,
which will include the Secretary of Treasury?
Yeah, of course. I mean, this is the issue,
and this is what Congress,
both Democrats and Republicans fought against and said,
we're not giving this much power to Henry Paulson,
and we're not giving this much power to someone
we don't even know who it is.
We don't even know which president will appoint this person.
I'm going to have to...
We haven't seen the current bill.
We're told it involves a lot more oversight
and a lot more transparency. We're going to have to see that,
and we and many others will be evaluating that.
There's an argument that the Democratic plan
actually in ways gives more power
than the White House plan does to the Treasury official.
But yes, I mean, we had the other day,
the Professor John Macy from Yale saying,
this is the single largest transfer of power
from the legislative branch to the executive branch
in U.S. history. Those are powerful, powerful comments.
Where did all the money go that Wall Street firms
made during the housing boom? That's from Thomas.
It's gone. There's less money in the world.
That is such a weird idea to me.
I know. I mean, I guess I've been covering economics
too long because it doesn't seem that weird to me.
I mean, you know, your house is worth 100 grand.
You buy it at 100 grand.
Then a few years later, your neighbor sells
an identical house for 200 grand.
So you think to yourself, hey, my house is worth 200 grand.
Now, no one gave you 100.
Yeah, there's no actual dollars.
What you're talking about is value.
Is value, but it's denominated in dollars.
And then a year later, there's, I don't know,
your neighborhood goes through a really bad spell
and there's a lot of crime,
and your house is back to $80,000.
It's down to $80,000.
No one burned a pile of money
that represents the difference.
Just the value went down.
But there's only a small amount of actual money.
I mean, a very small amount of actual money
undergirds the whole system.
Dollar bills, you mean? Dollar bills, yeah.
And the dollar bills, you know,
there's what economists call the velocity of money.
If I have five bucks and I give it to you for doing,
you know, you sell me this bell here for five bucks,
and then I give you that five bucks,
and then you give it to our friend Annie
for a sandwich that she made,
and then Annie gives it to someone else,
we have added $20 to the economy
with the same $5 bill.
Actually, our colleague David Kessenbaum
suggested that he and I just stand
in a corner of the office with $1,000
and just hand it back and forth to each other all day.
Increase the velocity of money.
Increase the velocity of money.
So there's less money.
It's that simple.
It's a hard concept to grasp,
but there is less money.
But some of these people got rich.
What do you mean there's less money?
Some of this money went somewhere.
There are winners,
but if you add up the winners
and you add up the losers,
the net result is a lot more losers
and a lot more losing.
There is trillions of dollars.
I mean, 20 trillion.
I mean, every home in America, basically,
or many homes in America,
are worth considerably less than they were two years ago.
There's less credit card lines.
There's less people buying stuff.
There is less money in the world today.
But the money that the Wall Street firms made,
those dollars, some of those dollars
are in people's bank accounts
or boats or fancy houses.
Well, yes.
I mean, some people made money along the way,
but the banks are worth a lot less,
tens of billions of dollars less today.
And that money did not go somewhere.
There's not a fixed amount of money.
There is a...
Usually, there's more money every day
than there was the day before,
and there's more every year
than there was the year before.
And I know, Laura, you and I are planning
some special shows on what is money.
And we'll get into all this then,
because it's very complicated.
And I might not be doing the greatest job
of explaining it,
but there is generally more money every year
than the year before.
There's not a fixed amount.
It's not that there's a million dollars
and we just split, you know,
and sometimes the rich grab it.
The economy generally grows,
but every now and then,
during recessions and other crises,
we go through a period where there's less money,
and that's what we are going through now.
I think you're holding up very well here, Adam,
actually, you're doing a great job.
Lynn wants to know,
could you explain what might happen to normal people
if the, quote, financial system collapses?
Are we really destined to become
one of those hollow-eyed people
in pictures from the Great Depression,
or is the effect more likely to be something dire,
like my credit card limits going down?
All right, it's somewhere in between those two.
Let me say that.
It's, you know, the general image I get
is like late 70s U.S., Malays,
maybe a little worse than that,
not quite Great Depression bad.
I mean, here's the scary-
We still had disco then.
We had disco.
We had, you know-
There's pleasure in life then.
Those were my favorite years of school.
I went to PS3 in the village.
I loved it.
The nightmare scenario
that people started talking about a while ago,
and that last week we thought we actually saw
on Wednesday and Thursday,
and on all things considered,
on this Friday, Alex Bloomberg and I
are doing a special story,
and then we're gonna expand it
from This American Life.
Next week, we're doing another NPR,
This American Life collaboration,
is about what happened the day the economy almost died.
What would happen?
The nightmare scenario is the seizing up of credit markets.
People, banks don't lend money to other banks.
Banks don't lend money to other businesses.
Virtually no business in America can survive very long
without access to credit,
access to a line of credit from the bank.
Even if you're a really healthy growing company,
maybe you bought a few cars this week,
or you bought that, you know,
you painted your front door,
or you did something that cost you
a little more money than you had on hand.
No big deal.
You borrowed a line of credit from the bank
and you paid your employees with it.
Every business does this all the time.
They float in and out of being cash flow positive
and cash flow negative,
as the accountants would call it.
If there was no lending,
if there's no available lending,
people don't get paid.
People don't buy cars.
People don't paint the front of their houses.
Whatever you do for a living,
whoever pays you to do that
doesn't have the money to do it.
And whoever pays them
so that they might have the money to do it next week
won't pay them.
It's unimaginable,
because that aspect of it did not happen
in the Great Depression,
in this scenario that we're describing,
because we have a very different financial system.
No one quite knows what would happen.
We just, I mean, the language I hear is
the economy would cease for a period of time.
We don't know what happens.
It's scary.
There are many economists who say
that's likely to have happened.
There are many responsible economists who say,
nah, it really,
it'll sort itself out sooner than you'd think.
And there is no reason to panic.
And I also would say a huge difference
between the Great Depression and now.
Well, there's two huge differences.
One is FDIC insurance.
I mean, we all have most of our money
insured by the FDIC, hopefully.
Two is the government is on this.
Maybe there's lots of quibbles about what they're doing
and they might be spending more money than they need
or less money than they need.
They might be doing it in a wrong way.
But the Great Depression,
I mean, you had four years from 1929 to 1933
where the government is just not doing anything
and things are getting worse and worse and worse.
That is not the case here.
So those things make me feel like
it's not time to panic.
Adam, thank you.
Thank you, Laura.

I’m OK I think we’re given the time and date on this week. It is Thursday, September 25 at 2:14 PM to latest big piece of music and six minutes ago. Looks like the Democrats and Republicans senate and the house, Congress in the White House for three at least in agreement , all on a bail out package $700 billion $700, billion that you will know more we know right now so we will leave it at that. We’ve gotten a lot of questions and we want more. We really find it very helpful to know what you are planet money on npr.orgtwitter.com/planetmoneyornpr.org/andre wants to know why is it AIG Lehman brothers, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, so many investment banks are all experiencing bankruptcy  And time something smells fishy to me so look under there is something fishy fishy is there is less money in the world that is what has happened between Cuba call Alden mobile. There was a huge explosion credit been given out home values were going up, which set a whole virtuous cycle it’s called him return thanks  Police with mint mobile economy pumped up to many more trillions of dollars than it was before between 2000 and 2007 massive what happened and now we were watching that giant balloon deflate a bit where were nowhere near where we were in 2000 but we have lost trillions of dollars  That is affecting every institution every business, every bank, the world but it’s affecting some more than others so they are all interrelated in and the impact of one impact the other for basically they are all victims. Also causes of ebbing tides yeah or the shaky ones faster in the ones that are Valenciano , Everett seems that we now have some kind of an agreement to curb executive paper bags to take a vantage of Adele out. Everett wants to know you mentioned we mentioned in past podcast worried that rather than stay at the beach to correct the mistakes some executives with leave or higher, paying position different companies. I know this is not all bad people but who would have them additional be able to negotiate a salary they can’t say if you don’t pay me what I want then I’ll stay where I’m at the job market as a market. Like any other supply and demand you are one of the handbook. People know how to run a huge large corporation. Then you are part of a very small group of people. I don’t know that it’s a good thing to have on your résumé that you ran a major bank that collapsed but I do think that a lot of these people are very smart, very capable and there will be many companies that want them, and possibly far more companies that want them then there  Are are available CEOs agreed but Smith talked about self sure he’ll be great to people. Generally thought you know I’m gonna take less money and serve to come and do it doesn’t seem to conform experience of more science for Sarah question a lot disaster is reversed pyramid. We have this narrow base of fault mortgages, holding up all these read it  Swaps all over the place. What did you just stabilize the beach give 5 million homeowners trouble on their mortgages $50,000 each to buy some time and find the stuff I don’t know that that is the exact solution that fit awful lot of the homeowner for closing part , of course many of the banks that are setting but we’re just giving 50,000 to everybody to give it only to the people who are struggling but aren’t those the people who took the biggest risk, so why are the people who didn’t take risks not benefiting their choosing, which investment firms are going to get about us. That’s why I thought there right and we don’t know how we’re gonna do , there are some solutions this level or than that one for example, just cut cut the cabs on that mutual fund and 401(k) investment. Just go ahead and get the government financing for the next year if you wanted to mutual funds in savings accounts and we will never pass that money to encourage us all to save a lot more money  System which provides money moving through the system available. I would love that and then it allows the market banks another idea of the government just buys the homes in foreclosure then out to the owner complicated time for the perfect. Danny has a question I think it has to do with the idea of oversight $700 billion bail out comes with a lot of power, the secretary of treasury to go ahead and buy what he likes to buy not buy with doesn’t like to buy any ask what the new president chooses on cabinet, which will include the secretary , this is this this is what Congress both Democrats and Republicans but we’re not giving as much power to Henry Paulson. We’re not give you this much power to someone we don’t even know who it is even know which president I’m gonna have to we haven’t seen the current builder evaluate  Democratic plan actually Waze give more power than the White House we had the other day. This is the single largest transfer power of the legislative branch powerful powerful. Where did all the money go that Wall Street firms made during housing? I know I don’t you know your house is worth 100 divided 100 years later your neighbor sells an identical house for 200, 200 grand gave you  Value is valuable as denominator than dollars and then a year later there’s I don’t know if your neighborhood really bad spelling a lot of crime in your house is back to $80 down to $80,000. No one burn pile of money that represents a different small amount of actual very small amount  Dollar bills dollar bills yeah and the dollar bills five if I have five bucks and I give it to you five bucks and then I can do that five bucks and then you give it to our friend Annie for a sandwich someone else we have added $20 to them to the economy with the same five dollar bill  Jessica corner of the office with back-and-forth. Increase the velocity of money all right so there’s less money it’s that simple. It’s a hard concept to grass but there is less people get rich somewhere. There are winners but if you add up the winners and that result in a lot more loser Williams $1. 20 trillion I mean every home in America  Credit card line less people find money in the world put the money in at the Wall Street firms made those dollar summons dollars are in peoples bank accounts or boats. Oh yes I mean some people need money along the way but the banks are worth tens of billions of dollars less today , usually there’s more money every day than it was the day before and then more every year. What is a month but there is generally more money every year than you fixed amount. It’s nothing there’s $1 million grows but every now and then crisis less if you’re holding up very well her out of her great job when wants to know, could you explain what might happen to normal people if financial system  Absences are you destined to become one of those hollow I’d go with pictures from the great depression affect more likely to be something dire like my credit cards are somewhere in between those two general late 70s US malaise may be a little worse than that. we are disco with you no pleasure in like that , the the nightmare scenario, the people started talking a while ago and that last week we thought we actually saw on Wednesday like next week library is about what happened to Dedi economy almost died what would happen the nightmare scenario is people banks don’t let money to other banks, businesses, virtually, no business in America access, credit access to a line of credit from the bank even if you’re a really healthy growing company  Cars this week are you bought that you painted your your front door or you did something to cost you a little more money for the line of credit every business does this all the time if there was no lending whatever you do for a living whoever pays you to do that doesn’t have the money to do it and whoever pays them they might have the money to do it next week won’t pay them  That aspect of it did not happen in the Great Depression we just do the language I hear is four. I don’t know I don’t know what happened scary or many many responsible time is it and I also would say I’ll have most of our money and see hopefully too is the government is on this maybe there’s lotta quibbles about what they’re doing and they might be spending more money than they need  But the great depression 1929 to 1933 not worse and worse that is not so I don’t think you even listening to NPR’s planet money podcast podcast episode.
