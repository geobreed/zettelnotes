# Points

- Tuesday, September 23 5:34 p.m news
	- Paulson Bernanke met Senate Finance Committee, with testy reception. 
		- A bit skepticism of timing. 
		- Jim Bunning called un-American, socialism. 
		- But in the end it came out. 
		- Still don't know the final shape is like.
		- Paulson only say what he wants, that the bill passed quickly.
	- press gaggle phone call out of the White House.
		- Tony Fratto, deputy press chief of White House, says about the 2 page bill had been worked out by policy staff for months
		- although been thought as sort of a quite hastily drawn together
- Interviews with Tim Adams, used to work for Hendy Paulson in Treasury department as undersecretary for international affairs at Treasury, now private consultation with the Lindsey Group.
	- as close adviser to the president from the election and reelection, how do we weigh the economic policies, about what he or you get wrong.
		- current condition is from past 20 or 30 years worth of decisions
		- with recent dot-com bubble, systems are prone to bubbles, as is ours
		- preparation from the Congress going forward is important
		- about failure itself, there is a lot to go around.
			- the system's failure
			- wrong incentives for player
			- results of regulatory entities in this and previous administration
			- we changed laws with unintended consequences
	- can you give me an example?
		- we lift the leverage ratios in 2004, when Donaldson as Head of SEC, and we don't think of the result with unregulated institution like investment banks
			- to explain, with 100 in investment bank, the past law is 12 to 1, they can lend 1,200
			- with lifted ratio to 30 to 1, they can lend 3,000
			- which is dangerously high leveraged situation
		- and a lot of people and institution that transact and rating instrument that they don't understand
		- only now we found out that we didn't understand the complexities
		- a failure across the system
		- a failure of management on these institution that is highly compensated
		- a failure to understand what they transact but making loans and securitizing
		- so no incentive to make sure it's a good quality lending.
	- what did you personally get most wrong, the thing that you wish understood at the time?
		- easy to look at the trees and ignore the forest, like regulators look at specific practices in entities that cause problems.
		- but there wasn't enough attention to the whole system, because the assumption is the system self corrects
		- but the entire supply chain failed
	- by entire supply chain, you mean maybe one or four banks, the rest is good.
		- right, that is the assumption
		- that everyone had computer model for all they buy and sell and know the fat-tailed distribution of potential outcomes
		- but we didn't understand, and in the end we quit trying
- interview with Brad Setser, a former Treasury official under Clinton, at the Council on Foreign Relations, about one specific part of this proposed bill from the White House
	- section 10, maximum amount of authorized purchases by the secretary under this act shall be limited to $700 billion. how much is $700 billion? how should we think about it?
		- a very large sum, more than the US oil import bill for a year even at these massive price
		- a simple visual, 
			- it's equal to the entire US trade and current account deficit
			- equal to the amount we borrow from the rest of the world every given year
			- about 5% of US GDP
	- does anybody have $700 billion domestically? or it's just the US government?
		- the US government don't have that money, 
		- only ability to borrow and ability to promise with credibility to repay plus interest
	- there is no one company or even one industry that could get $ 700 billion together
		- well the closes would be the oil, the only 3 country who could is US japan china
		- and only china which is like poor country lending rich country
- listener questions
	- the administration didn't cut out the golden parachutes for executives is there a reason that this will somehow benefit taxpayer?
		- the argument is not so that they can spend on stuff
		- but if it's cut, the bank are less likely to participate in this buyout because the executive don't want to lose their salary
		- these are the very people whose expertise you need right now
		- it's the science of incentives "the theory of moral sentiments" - economics does not talk about the moral of our nature, it talks about our incentives
		- if no incentives to themselves, its easy to convince themselves about their own best interest
	- but on street level, a lot of people want these bankers to leave
		- and it's a shaky place to assume negotiating position, like asking for help and demanding
		- but the argument from labor point of view, for them to leave to other industries or not prioritizing effort.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:
Hi, and welcome to the PLANET MONEY podcast. I'm Adam Davidson, here with Laura Conaway...

LAURA CONAWAY, BYLINE: 
How you doin'?

DAVIDSON: 
...Dan Costello...

DAN COSTELLO, BYLINE: 
Hey there.

DAVIDSON: 
...And Alex Blumberg.

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: 
Hello.

DAVIDSON: 
Today is Tuesday, September 23. It's 5:34 p.m. Dan, quickly, where are we in the news?

COSTELLO: 
The biggest thing that happened today is that Paulson and Bernanke met with the Senate Finance Committee and received a testy reception.

DAVIDSON: 
This was not the welcome that they had hoped, the we're going to just pass the bill that the president sent no matter what.

COSTELLO: 
Far from it, yeah. There was a bit of skepticism about the timing of when - most people think this will pass but skepticism about the timing of it and exactly what's it going to look like.

BLUMBERG: 
Was Jim Bunning in full effect?

COSTELLO: 
He was in full effect. I think he called un-American, and this was socialism.

BLUMBERG: 
And it - oh, I was wondering - going to say, was the S-word used?

COSTELLO: 
The S - it was used.

BLUMBERG: 
OK.

COSTELLO: 
It took a while to get there, but it came out.

DAVIDSON: 
But we don't know what the bill will look like. We don't - I mean, we've heard a lot of possibilities, but we don't yet know where they're negotiating.

COSTELLO: 
Yeah. At the end of the day, Paulson didn't back down. I mean, he really stood firm, and he didn't give many specifics, which is exactly what he says. He wants, as he says, to have this passed quickly, get on the ground running and not be stymied by any of these other additions to the bill.

DAVIDSON: 
And Laura, you just blogged something about the White - something out of the White House.

CONAWAY: 
Yeah, I did. There was a press gaggle phone call today, and Tony Fratto, deputy press chief of the White House, said that this bill - which I have actually been thinking of as sort of quite hastily drawn together - had been considered by any number of policy people actually for months.

DAVIDSON: 
The two-page bill.

CONAWAY: 
Yeah, that the policy implications of this had been worked out by certain members of the policy staff for months.

DAVIDSON: 
Wow. So we're going to play some interviews today. Yesterday, I got a chance to catch up with Tim Adams. He used to work for Henry Paulson in the Treasury department. Tim Adams was undersecretary for international affairs at Treasury. He's now a private - in private consultation with - in - with The Lindsey Group.

I know you've been a close adviser to the president even before he was president, right?

TIM ADAMS: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
You know, and you've - you worked hard to get him elected and reelected.

ADAMS: 
Right. Right.

DAVIDSON: 
It - you know, it looks like - I mean, it's hard to give a huge, ringing endorsement to his economic policies. How do we weigh that? What did he get wrong? What did you get wrong?

ADAMS: 
Well, I think everyone makes mistakes. We're human. And, you know, you certainly - it's easy to Monday morning quarterback lots of different decisions. But I think we are where we are because of 20 or 30 years - as we described at the top of the show, 20 or 30 years' worth of decisions. And some were made in this administration, some in previous administrations. Remember, in the late '90s, we had the dot-com tech bubble, which was the largest equity bubble - if you measured on a P/E basis, the largest equity bubble since the 1920s. So our system is prone to bubbles, as are most systems. And we just think about - we need to think about how do you respond to them, but more importantly, how do you prepare for them? And that's the real task going forward that I think Congress won't wrestle with so much this week, but next year they'll wrestle with, how do you build a new regulatory structure and system for 21st century finance?

DAVIDSON: 
I feel like you dodged my question a little bit.

(LAUGHTER)

ADAMS: 
I did dodge it.

DAVIDSON: 
Yeah.

ADAMS: 
I think there's a lot of blame to go around. I think the system itself had lots of failures. I think the incentives were wrong for a lot of the players. I think there were a lot of regulatory entities that should have done a better job not only in this administration, previous administrations. I think we changed laws in ways that had unintended consequences.

DAVIDSON: 
Can you give an example?

ADAMS: 
Well, we lift the leverage ratios in 2004, when Mr. Donaldson was head of the SEC. And we didn't think about - enough about what that meant for the unregulated institutions such as investment banks. And then...

DAVIDSON: 
And just to explain what that means to listeners who might not be familiar, that means if an - it used to be if an investment bank had 100 bucks, they could lend out - I think it was 12-to-1.

ADAMS: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
Like, they could lend out a 1,200 bucks. Then you lifted the restrictions, and they could lend out 3000 bucks, 30-to-1, which now, at least - I mean, with the benefit of hindsight - looks like a dangerously highly leveraged situation. Is that fair to...

ADAMS: 
Indeed. And I think you had a lot of people who were - and institutions who were buying and selling and rating instruments that they just didn't understand. We didn't understand the complexities associated with them. And I think what we're now finding out is that we didn't understand them. And it was, again, a failure across the system - that's to say the rating agencies understand. It was a failure of management in many of these institutions, which were handsomely compensated, but failure of management to understand what they were buying and holding and selling. And you had a lot of institutions that were making loans and then simply securitizing them and getting them off their books. So they weren't - they didn't have the incentive to ensure that it was good-quality lending.

DAVIDSON: 
What did you get most wrong, personally? What did you not understand that you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself?

ADAMS: 
You know, I think all too often we look at the - you look at the trees rather than the entire system, you know? And it's easy to - it's easy for the different regulators to go into the entities they regulated and to look at specific practices that caused them problems. But there wasn't enough attention paid to the whole system being in question and - because we assumed the whole system would work itself out - that if there were problems, it would be an institutional-specific or just one node in the supply chain. But, in fact, the entire supply chain failed. And I think it was just - we were...

DAVIDSON: 
And by entire supply chain - I mean, basically, what you're saying is you thought, OK, there's a chance that one investment bank or four banks or whatever will collapse, but that the whole system of money moving around the country and around the world - that was fundamentally sound. That was solid as a rock.

ADAMS: 
Right. We just all assumed that everyone knew what they were buying and selling and that the computer models that were in the basements of a lot of these institutions and the - you know, the guys who wanted to be physicists but couldn't and ended up creating these models - that, you know, they really captured the full range of risk and the various outcomes - the so-called fat-tailed distributions of potential outcomes, and that it would - you would - that they would understand what those different outcomes would look like and would manage to them. But, in fact, we didn't, and they were just far too complex, and people just didn't understand them. And after a while, I think they quit trying.

CONAWAY: 
Wow.

BLUMBERG: 
Wow. They quit trying. It's Alex Blumberg. I'm Adam's partner at PLANET MONEY. And, Adam, you and I talked yesterday to Brad Setser, who's at the Council on Foreign Relations, and he is a former Treasury official under Clinton. And you - we brought him in to - so that you could ask him a very - about one specific part of this proposed bill from the White House - this proposed $700 billion bailout bill.

DAVIDSON: 
Section 10, maximum amount of authorized purchases - the secretary's authority to purchase troubled assets under this act shall be limited to $700 billion outstanding at any one time. And the main thing I want to get out of this conversation with you is, how much is $700 billion? How should we think about that, and what will that do to the dollar, to me, to our listeners?

So, first off, what is 700 billion? Is that real money or is that play money for - you know, I know a million dollars means nothing to the - when you're thinking about the global economy. A hundred million dollars means nothing. Does 700 billion mean nothing?

BRAD SETSER: 
No, $700 billion is a very large sum. It's equal - it's more than the U.S. oil import bill, even the...

DAVIDSON: 
For a year.

SETSER: 
For a year - significantly more. If...

DAVIDSON: 
Even at these massive...

SETSER: 
Even at these massive prices, it is...

DAVIDSON: 
So the government could have just bought us all as much gas as we wanted with this...

SETSER: 
And given it to us, yes.

DAVIDSON: 
And given it to us.

(LAUGHTER)

SETSER: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
Wow.

SETSER: 
If you want a - sort of a simple visual, yeah. It's equal to the entire U.S. trade and current account deficit. So it's the - equal to the amount that we borrow from the rest of the world in every given year, which is a very large sum. So I think, by any measure, this is a - it's about 5% of U.S. GDP. It's a - it's real money.

BLUMBERG: 
Does anybody besides the U.S. government have $700 billion domestically, or is that just - is that a sum that only governments have?

SETSER: 
Well, the U.S. government doesn't actually have $700 billion. It has the ability to borrow...

BLUMBERG: 
Right.

SETSER: 
...Seven hundred billion dollars and has the ability to promise, with credibility, to repay someone $700 billion plus interest...

BLUMBERG: 
Right, but...

SETSER: 
...Some years out.

DAVIDSON: 
But could ExxonMobil...

BLUMBERG: 
Could ExxonMobil or GE - they couldn't - that's - this is a sum that's beyond...

SETSER: 
Yes, this is...

BLUMBERG: 
...That, right? There's no one company - there's no - even one industry, really, that could get $700 billion together, or...

SETSER: 
Well, I mean, the oil industry probably would be the closest 'cause oil - selling oil is a very profitable business right now. And if you - if the oil industry went out and borrowed a ton of money, sort of took its entire profits, borrowed some more from the banks who were willing to lend to oil companies 'cause, you know, oil is worth something...

BLUMBERG: 
Yeah.

SETSER: 
...Then you could maybe mobilize a fund of this size.

BLUMBERG: 
OK.

SETSER: 
But, you know, a big investment bank would have a balance sheet of roughly a trillion dollars - a big, very leveraged investment bank. And that doesn't mean that they have a trillion dollars they can give away willy nilly. That's their entire portfolio. And part of the problem is that a big part of that portfolio is illiquid, meaning that they can't sell off something that they currently hold.

DAVIDSON: 
When I think of illiquidity, I think liquid is cash in your pocket, illiquid is your house. It's worth something, but you can't give it to someone. You have to do a lot of stuff before you...

SETSER: 
I think it's even worse than your house because this is assets - claims on your house. And since no one knows quite what you could sell your house for, particularly now, they don't really know what a bundle of the mortgages on a whole bunch of different houses is worth. So it's like your house cubed.

DAVIDSON: 
And how many countries? I mean, Japan could borrow 700 billion.

SETSER: 
Yes, Japan could borrow that.

DAVIDSON: 
Could Great Britain?

SETSER: 
You know, Great Britain, it'd be - could they? Probably, but it would be - you're getting above 10% of the GDP, well above 10% of the GDP of any major European country. So it'd be a phenomenal sum.

DAVIDSON: 
Now, he did say there is one country - Alex, if you remember, one country that actually has 700 billion and...

BLUMBERG: 
I will guess. I will guess - China.

SETSER: 
China could give us that 700 billion and, in some ways, will lend it to us.

BLUMBERG: 
Which I find totally - I can't - I'm still staggered by that. Literally, there's three entities on Earth - if you don't count the oil industry, three entities on Earth that could borrow $700 billion - the United States, Japan and China. And that's basically it.

DAVIDSON: 
And only one of them actually has it...

BLUMBERG: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
...Which is China, which is interesting because throughout history, as I understand it - and maybe parts of my details are wrong - but generally the richest country at any given time, whether that was Spain at one time or Portugal or the United Kingdom or the United States for a long time, the rich country always had money that it wouldn't lend to poor countries. And this situation where we have a poor country lending us money is highly unusual.

CONAWAY: 
I've got a listener question today from Lia Julias (ph) of Saint Paul, Minn. She's looking at this $700 billion bailout bill, and she's looking at one part of it in particular.

LIA JULIAS: 
I've read that the administration is balking at the idea of cutting out golden parachutes for banking executives. And I'm trying to figure out if there's a reason beyond protecting, you know, special interests that they'd be doing that. So there's an economic reason, such as some sort of variation of supply side economics. You know, if these executives walk away with all this money, that will somehow benefit the taxpayer. Otherwise, I can't see the justification in it.

BLUMBERG: 
That's a really good question.

DAVIDSON: 
It's an excellent question, Lia. And I'll just say quickly, the argument is not that it benefits the economy by giving these executives millions of dollars that they would then spend on stuff. The argument is, if we cut their pay, then banks that are in a shaky position are less likely to participate because the executives aren't going to want to participate and - in this buyout because they don't want to lose their salary. And...

BLUMBERG: 
That's - well, that strikes me as just such a bogus argument, though, because, I mean, if banks that are in a shaky position will end up like Lehman Brothers, you know, I mean, isn't...

DAVIDSON: 
But if you're on the fence...

SETSER: 
And if you're an executive, you're - I mean, maybe some of them are thinking about the company itself, but some might look at a job offer from Google or someone else. You know what I mean? When...

BLUMBERG: 
Oh, so...

SETSER: 
These are the very people whose expertise you need right now.

BLUMBERG: 
So they - literally they will say - they're worried about people saying, screw it, I don't care about the global economy. I don't care about my own company. If I don't get my $22 million walking bonus, I'm going to go away.

DAVIDSON: 
I mean, it's basic...

SETSER: 
Unfortunately, yeah.

DAVIDSON: 
Look, economics is the science of...

BLUMBERG: 
Yeah.

DAVIDSON: 
...Partially the science of incentives. And I don't - it's not a moral - well, actually, that's not true. Adam Smith called it a moral science.

BLUMBERG: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
"The Theory Of Moral Sentiments" was one of his main books. But the point is not - economics does not talk about the moral, better parts of our nature. It talks about our incentives. And if you take away an incentive to - for an individual to benefit themselves, it's remarkable how easy it is for individuals to convince themselves that what's in their own best interest...

CONAWAY: 
But at the street level, a lot of people would like to offer these bankers an incentive to leave.

BLUMBERG: 
Yeah. And I also don't feel like they're in any sort of negotiating position at this point. Like, you can't - like, who - really? Like, you're coming to the government for the government to bail you out, basically, and you're going to demand, you know, executive pay. It doesn't seem - like, from a purely economic point of view, it doesn't seem like that is the case necessarily.

SETSER: 
Right, but from a purely economic point of view - I mean, not to get wonky, but if you - it's a labor market issue. I mean, if you don't pay these people enough money, they could leave to other industries or realize that they don't have enough skin in the game to go through the next six months or 12 months or two years that...

BLUMBERG: 
Right. Clearly, they've been...

SETSER: 
It's going to be brutal...

BLUMBERG: 
...Doing a bang-up job (laughter).

(CROSSTALK)

DAVIDSON: 
But wait a second.

CONAWAY: 
Come on.

DAVIDSON: 
Wait a second.

SETSER: 
Maybe...

DAVIDSON: 
I mean, look...

CONAWAY: 
Good help is hard to find, Adam Davidson.

DAVIDSON: 
There are clearly many people on Wall Street who have made colossal errors. Sure, I'm sure some of them are schmucks. Some of them are...

BLUMBERG: 
Right.

DAVIDSON: 
...Bear a fair amount of responsibility. I think a fair amount of them probably don't.

CONAWAY: 
There's a news bit, though. Dan, they're talking about this tomorrow on the Hill - right? - this executive pay thing.

COSTELLO: 
Yeah. And they're probably not going to get much farther on the issue than we've gotten here at the table.

BLUMBERG: 
Right.

COSTELLO: 
I mean, it's one of these talking points that gets a lot of people fired up. But the question is - makes you mad, but what do you do about it?

DAVIDSON: 
All right. Well, this has been PLANET MONEY podcast for Tuesday, September 23. I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you to Laura Conaway, Dan Costello and Alex Blumberg. We have so much analysis, observations, funny stuff, podcasts, all sorts of stuff at npr.org/money.
