an interview about the crisis with Raghu Rajan, a chief economist in IMF.

At current time, september 19th, we still have no detail of the bailout. But essentially the bailout comes from the taxpayer money with the hope that the bailout will be a profitable investment. So far the proposal is for government buying the toxic assets or the firms shares. In both scenario the price point is important, if too low the bailout will fail, if too high then just giving free money away.

Financial crisis is undeniably a [[Value Altering Condition]]. At current time, with no market activity the assets looks like worthless. And it does worthless in market value perspective. But from intrinsic value of the assets itself still has some value, only the market does not know at what price it currently at. But some can say that the market need the government to be a strong party to dictate a price support and jumpstart market activity. Even though many economist agree that something need to be done, government setting prices or owning company does feels bad.

Different than Resolution Trust Corporation that taking over failed saving and loans, the government act as an insurer, not setting price and only need to sell slowly over time.

Some have think of a smart way for the government to handle this, one of that is force the firms shareholder to recapitalize. The government doesn't need to set price or own company and the shareholder has a reason to recapitalize.

[[Message Through Action]] from the government side in election time to be seen that they doing something. But

# Points

- september 19th
- Raghu Rajan, chief economist in International Monetary Fund, professor at Graduate School of Business at University of Chicago.
	- Everybody wants to know from where the money for the bailout coming? The trillion dollars for super bailout and buy a lot of bad assets, Whose money is that? Where's the source?
		- we don't know the form of the bailout, can be buyout of asset, or capital infusions
		- but essentially it's the taxpayer money which is going to be invested hopefully not too high price
		- and hoping the asset price recover and turn a profit
		- it's an involuntary investment in Wall Street
	- 'not too high a price' means 'not too high a risk'?
		- well both, so far there is 2 proposal
			- 1. government buys the toxic waste on the bank balance sheets
			- 2. government buy shares in these firms directly
		- in both scenario there is the question 'at what price?'
		- if government overpays, than it means it's a gift from taxpayer to Wall Street
		- and if holding these assets or shares over time and recover the value, there's profit on behalf of the taxpayer.
	- it seems that if an object if worth less and the government buys it for anything, it's already paid more than it was worth isn't it?
		- and there's the issue, some assets currently have no market, no seller no buyer
		- but there is still some value, except nobody knows
		- some people can say that the current market value is zero
		- but some can say people are scared, and if the government come and buy the stuff, they can create support price
		- and if its low enough, the government will make money when these assets market recovers
	- what is the position among economists, does they agrees this is good or is it fairly hot debated right now?
		- there is definitely sense that something need to be done
		- queasy feeling about government buying company and interfering with market and setting prices with worries of mistakes on each
		- other concerns is if the current path is the wrong path to take and ended up just wasting taxpayer money
	- there is hedge fund investors that sees opportunities to make a fortune from the government
		- it really matters how it was structured, buy directly to firm or buy on the open market
		- buying from open market can invite speculator to buy up the assets before dumping it, especially if the government set higher price than market value
		- so there is a possibility of danger, the level of government involvement and their limit, a hesitant move can be taken advantage by speculators
		- people analogize with Resolution Trust Corporation, an entity by the government to take over failed saving and loans corporations in 1980s
		- but in that scenario, the government owned those association because they gone bust and government is the insurer, the government doesn't have to set price and only have to sell them slowly over time
		- in this scenario, the government have to buy assets and need to answer a lot of question, how much buying, from whom, at what price.
	- do you see a smart way for the government to do this?
		- the real problem in the industry is lack of capital
		- and we need to figure out how to recapitalize it
		- the fear is that the credit contraction because of the shortage of capital and then creating a recession
		- there is 3 ways
			- 1 government recapitalizes
			- 2 find new shareholders, sovereign wealth funds, private equity to put capital
			- 3 ask original shareholders to put up more capital
		- the 1st option is really should be the last thing to try
		- maybe because election year increase the motivation for action taking, the 1st option become the 1st choice
		- 2nd option is a bit explored with china and korea
		- but the 3rd option we haven't tried and Goldman Sachs is better equipped sense wise for buying strange assets than some government bureaucrat
		- my proposal is 2 step:
			- 1 ask all to stop paying dividends to stop leakage of capital
			- 2 raise more capital from the shareholders, a rights offering is an effective way
	- the current message from the government is that the firms can't save itself but you don't believe it
		- yes, because we haven't even doing the coercion
		- The signal of this action is different than the government, if Citibank all capital to shareholder, they will be scared
		- But if government ordered them to the signal is different
		- But for the election year it’s all comforting because there’s something to be done and those bad incentives and moral hazard is postponed
		- Politician sees short term horizon, but public need to sees long term problem
		- Like we’re not bailing out Lehman brothers, a good stances
		- But bailing aig
	- the taxpayer money what is the eventual effect on the economy, maybe we get profit off this bail out, but diverting from roads schools troops 
		- the government can issues more debt and not cutting budget
		- But eventually there is choices to make
	- What’s this got to do with the price of milk
		- Nothing
		- But it could eventually affect milk’s price if the economy collapse
		- But it’s a long way from that
	- What are sort of trickle down or ripple out effects
		- If the government succeed refloating the financial system than there won’t be too much of an effect on access to loans
		- If they fail then loans will be harder because of credit crunch and eventually impact ordinary citizen
	- feels like the hypothetical direction taken is missing a couple opportunities like self capitalizing and other investment avenues
		- Indeed, but hindsight is 20 20
		- There is regulatory lapse like forcing to recapitalize
		- But many of us including academics thought this is a crisis but not as deep as now

The U.S. Treasury Department and members of Congress are considering a $1 trillion plan to buy up bad assets on Wall Street. Economist Raghu Rajan says that looks like a move made in panic to him. He blames election-year politics, and proposes a way for Wall Street to save itself. 

https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2008/09/government_to_buy_toxic_waste.html

OK, go ahead and worry. The government's idea for saving Wall Street could work out well for you, or ... not. I say that after talking to Raghuram G. Rajan, former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund and current University of Chicago professor.

Rajan talked to us for our Planet Money podcast -- I'll post it later today -- and he described the Wall Street situation this way:

The U.S. government is now working on a plan to rescue Wall Street (meaning investors, banks, investment banks, investment firms, you name it) from the billions of bad debt they now have on their books. This could take something like $1 trillion of U.S. taxpayer money (yours and mine) for a rescue plan that has yet to be designed. Maybe we'd make money on the deal, if we bought bad debt or falling shares in investment firms and they later rise in value. Maybe we'd lose money, if we buy stuff no one wants and it just tanks.

The point is, Rajan says, the U.S. government is about to put the taxpayer through an enormous and involuntary investment in Wall Street, and in the worst stuff on Wall Street, the "toxic waste," largely because:

We're in an election year.

That's what he said. As he see it, the government has three choices. It could look to foreign governments to invest in the banks, which hasn't been working out so great. It could bail the banks out using U.S. taxpayer money. Or it could ask the investment firms to get its own shareholders to pony up. Of those, having the taxpayer foot the bill is the one he'd pick last.

"Election year, need to be seen to be doing something, lots of politicians jumping on -- that's why we're doing it as the first thing," Rajan says.

Rajan advocates two steps. First, troubled firms should stop paying dividends -- basically, they should shut off the flow of money so they can start to replenish their capital. Second, the firms should turn to investors, who of course are already on the hook, with what's called a "rights offering."

"Essentially, go to shareholders and say, 'I'm going to give you one more share at half the market price,' " he argues. "Shareholders really have no alternative but to put in that money. This would recapitalize a whole bunch of strong institutions. . . . We haven't even started doing the coercion would would be needed to get private sector initiative."

Over the weekend, he says, the picture of just what Congress and regulators have in mind should start filling in. "It really matters how this thing is structured," he says. He's hoping -- we all are -- that any government bailout will be cleverly designed so that taxpayers don't get skunked.

**(Adam Davidson):**
This is the Planet Money podcast. This is our, what is it, our fifth emergency crisis week podcast of this very tumultuous week.

Today is September 19th. This week we're giving the time because things change so quickly. You need to know when we record these conversations. This is at 11.39 a.m. Eastern Time.

I am very, very happy that Raghu Rajan is joining us. Raghu, hello.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Hi.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Hi, Raghu Rajan was the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. He's now a professor at the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago. And he's going to walk us through a lot of the finer points of this crisis, and he's going to answer a lot of your questions.

We're also joined, of course, by Laura Conaway. Hi, Laura.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Good morning.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So Laura, do you want to just start by asking some of our listeners questions?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Well, yeah, the big one that's coming through, and this one's actually coming from listeners. I got it today in an edit meeting with people at NPR. Everybody wants to know where is the new bailout money coming from? This money they're saying a trillion dollars now to do this kind of super bailout and buy out lots of bad assets.

Whose money is that? Where's that money coming from?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, first, we don't know what the form of this bailout will take. Will it be a buyout of assets? Will it be capital infusions and so on?

But initially, the money is coming from your pocket. It's taxpayer money, which is going to be invested.

Hopefully, it will not be invested at too high a price. And the government will hope that eventually when asset prices recover, it will make some money off this.

But initially, it's your pocket, and it could be wasted.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So we are about to make an involuntary, by we, I mean the taxpayer, an involuntary investment in Wall Street, a big one.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
From all counts, yes.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And when you say you hope our money will get invested, but not at too high a price, you mean not at too high a risk?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, both. From the little that we can glean so far, and the weekend will tell us more, the government is going to buy the two sets of proposals, which are quite distinct.

One is where the government buys some of the toxic waste that sits on bank balance sheets. And the question there will be, at what price will it buy? Because in many of these cases, there is no market for these assets. If the government overpays relative to their fundamental value, essentially that difference is a gift from the taxpayer to Wall Street. If the government sort of holds on to these assets, and over time, you know, these assets recover in value, well, the government has made some money on behalf of the taxpayer. So the real question is, what price will it get those assets at?

The second alternative is for the government to buy shares in these firms directly, rather than buy the assets that these firms hold. And in that case, the question is, what price does it get the shares at? And in the long run, again, do these firms do reasonably well so that it makes money off it?

**(Laura Conaway):**
We've been talking an awful lot here at Planet Money about how people bought and sold things that they don't know what they're worth and that, in a lot of cases, they think are actually worth less.

So it seems to me that if an object is worth less and the government buys it for anything, it's already paid more than it was worth. Do you know what I mean?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Yes, well, so here's the issue. Some of these assets, currently, there is no market for these assets. Nobody's buying, nobody's selling, right?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah, they're junk.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, there is some value, except nobody knows what it is, right? And if you take the market value, and because there's no market, well, some people will say the market value is exactly zero, which is what you just said.

And therefore, anybody paying even a cent for these things is overpaying, right?

The other view is, well, people are too scared to buy into this stuff. They are certainly risky, but there is some value. And the government can come in because it's risk-averse. It has an infinite pocket, or at least infinite, as far as the taxpayers go. And, you know, it can buy into the stuff, create a support price. And because these assets truly have value, that support price is not going to be overpaying. And so long as it's set low enough, eventually the government will make money when these asset markets recover.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Is that Henry Paulson calling?

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah, sorry about that. That's actually my phone. And I apologize, I keep turning it off and it keeps ringing. That's our boss calling, but we'll leave that aside. We'll call our boss back later.

Raghu, I'm curious about sort of where the debate is in your profession among economists. Is your sense that pretty much everyone agrees this is a good idea, we have to do it? Or is this fairly hotly debated right now?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, I would say that there is a sense that something has to be done. But I would say many people are very queasy at the idea of governments entering markets and actually buying up assets there, setting a price when, in fact, the market is unwilling to set a price. And for the reasons that Laura mentioned, people are very worried, first about setting the wrong price and therefore offering a ton of money to people who made the biggest mistakes.

And the second is the concern that maybe this is the wrong way to call an end to the problem. All you've done is interfered with the market for a little while. A lot of speculators unload their bad assets onto the government. And then once the government runs out of money, because you need a pretty deep pocket and it's not clear the government wants to spend the amounts required, then the fall in prices resumes. And all you've done is wasted taxpayer money at that point.

**(Adam Davidson):**
There are hedge fund investors and other investors who are thinking, oh, boy, this is a huge opportunity. We can make a fortune off the United States government right now.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, that's where it really matters how this thing is structured, right?

Do you go directly to the firms and say, I'm going to buy your assets from you? Or do you say, I'm going to buy it on the open market?

If you say, I'm going to buy it on the open market, well, there are lots of potential speculators who've essentially bought up some of these assets in anticipation and will buy these assets in anticipation in order to unload it on you, especially if you set a higher price than what the market will bear.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So it sounds like what you're describing is a situation where if the U.S. government goes in a little bit here, they could really get skunked.

They kind of got to go in all the way.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Quite possibly, exactly. And this is where it starts getting dangerous, right? How much are you willing to go in? And at what point are you going to stop and say, we just can't do it?

People make the analogy to what is called the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was an entity set up by the government to take over the assets of failed savings and loans corporations in the 1980s. There's a big difference between that proposal, which was thought to be effective, and this one.

In that situation, the government effectively owned these savings and loans associations because they had gone bust and the government was the insurer. And so all these assets came onto the government balance sheet, and the government didn't have to set a price. It just had to figure out how to sell these assets slowly over time, and that's what it did quite effectively. In this case, you have to buy assets.

And then the question is, how much do you buy? Who do you buy from? Where do you buy? And none of those questions have been answered yet, and I don't know. We'll know at the end of this weekend what the answers are.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Do you see smart ways for the government to do this? 

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, I mean, my own personal view is that the real problem we have in the industry is a shortage of capital. And the real question we should be pondering is, how do we recapitalize these financial firms, making sure that it's not...

**(Adam Davidson):**
Hey, Laura? Sorry, I'm so sorry. Ellen keeps calling me. I think I just...

**(Laura Conaway):**
You got to grab this.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Do you want to just take over the podcast?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah, sure.

**(Adam Davidson):**
OK.

**(Laura Conaway):**
I'm sorry. Would you mind backing up just that, just starting again?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Yeah, I think the real problem in this industry is the lack of capital. And what we need to figure out is ways of recapitalizing this industry.

Now, why is that an important problem?

It's important for the average listener because when the banking system is short of capital, what they're going to do is try and shrink the kinds of things they do. So if they're making loans, they're going to shrink loans. If they're offering credit card loans, they're going to shrink that. Mortgage loans, all that.

That is what people fear the most, that the credit contraction that is going to take place as a result of the shortage of capital is going to impinge every household and thereby create a recession, which is much deeper than the current recessionary conditions we have.

So how do you stave that off? You try and recapitalize the industry.

Now, there are three ways of doing it. One is the government comes and recapitalizes. The second is you find new shareholders, sovereign wealth funds here and there, private equity funds to put up capital. And the third is you ask your own shareholders to put up more capital.

Now, I would say the government putting in capital is really the last thing we should try when we've tried everything else and it hasn't worked.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And that's the first thing we're trying.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Unfortunately, again, because of all the things you said, election year need to be seen to be doing something, lots of politicians jumping on. That's why we're doing it as the first thing.

Now, we've tried getting outsiders to try and pony up capital a little bit, but we haven't coerced the banks to do it.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Meaning other countries like China.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Exactly. China, Korea.

But I think the solution we haven't tried so far is asking the shareholders to pony up a little more. Certainly, it's in their incentive because if you've got a fragile bank, if you put more capital, it's going to make it more solid and reduce the chances of it going bust.

But even for the well-capitalized banks, and this is where I think the focus should be, if they have more capital, then they can do what people want the government to do. They can go out and buy these assets. And I would far rather have Goldman Sachs buying, you know, the strange assets that it created than having some government bureaucrat decide that they want to buy those assets. My sense is Goldman Sachs will have a far better sense of what to pay.

So I would propose that we do it in two steps. We ask all these guys to stop paying dividends. That will at least stop the leakage of capital from these financial firms. And second, I would say, go out and raise more capital from your own shareholders. There's a very effective way of doing it, which is called a rights offering. Essentially, go to your shareholders and say, I'm going to give you one more share at half the market price. And shareholders really have no alternative but to put in that money. And this would recapitalize a whole bunch of strong institutions. Get JP Morgan, get Wells Fargo, get Goldman to do it. There's a whole lot of excess capital now sitting on their banshees, which they can then use to revive some of these markets, which are defunct.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So the message we're getting from the government right now seems to be that the firms aren't able to save themselves. And you're saying poppycock.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Yes, I'm saying we haven't even started doing the coercion, which would be needed to get private sector initiative. Now, a lot of firms are unwilling to raise capital because they're worried about the signal it'll send.

If I try, if I'm Citibank, and I say I need another $20 billion of capital, my shareholders are going to say, oh my God, what do they know that we don't know, right?

But if the government says all of you guys go out and raise capital, and I'm telling you, you have to do it, then they're going to go and ask the shareholders, why go to the government for capital before you've gone to your own shareholders?

**(Laura Conaway):**
So can I just say back to you what I'm hearing, is that because we're in an election year because of political pressure, we are about to embark on a $1 trillion investment of taxpayer money in the Wall Street system that you think is actually the worst of the three possibilities on the table. We're actually about to do it.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Yeah, now, the reason why it's comforting to do it is you know it's going to happen. There's no risk, right, in the sense that if you put enough money into the banking system, you will revive it. And, you know, taxpayers bear the cost over time, and all the issues of bad incentives and moral hazard that people keep talking about is postponed to the future, right? It's not going to happen on my bail week.

So the incentive for politicians with short-term horizons is to do it the fast and efficient way, no matter what the cost. But the public should be worried about the long-term cost of doing this and ask the question, have we tried other solutions? Are we panicking too early?

And my sense is, you know, we are doing all these things in a state of panic. This proposal, whatever it is, and I have to remind you, we don't know what it is. So I'm talking about the various bad alternatives that could emerge.

There could be a clever design which deals with some of the issues I've talked about, right? And in that sense, I would postpone judgment till we actually see what it is.

But I am worried that what we've jumped from is a situation where, you know, in the case of Lehman Brothers, the government took a courageous stand, and I think a well-deserved one, of saying, well, we're not gonna bail out every firm which gets into trouble. These guys have had enough time to raise capital. They should have raised capital. They didn't. They created their own funeral. That's one view.

And then two days later, we bail out AIG, which again could be justified on some grounds because it was too connected to fail. But then another day later, we talk about bailing out the whole system.

Where did we jump from refusing to bail out Lehman to bailing out the entire system? We need some ounces.

**(Laura Conaway):**
All right, can we shift gears just a little bit? Now that you've painted such a clear picture for me of how this is, in fact, the taxpayer's money being spent.

A lot of my people wanna know about the eventual effects on the economy of this kind of thing. And if it is the taxpayer money, I think we can all sort of understand that a trillion dollars invested, let's call it invested right now, in the market. Let's say we get that back in more.

But that trillion dollars, we would be saying you can't use that right now for roads and schools and troops and so on. All those expenses would have to be either cut or picked up from somewhere else.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, not necessarily because the government could issue more debt. And so those trillion dollars will sort of be financed by the government and won't necessarily come from cutting its budget.

But it does raise questions of eventually making the choice between certain programs which do benefit people versus not doing those programs because eventually it has to be paid for.

**(Laura Conaway):**
One person wrote in to say, what's this got to do with the price of milk?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
At this point, nothing.

It could, in a roundabout way, affect the price of milk in the following sense that if, in fact, the economy collapses, because large financial institutions collapse, that would really have a serious effect on the ability of dairies to produce milk and so on, their ability to get financing from the local bank, and could have effects on both the production of milk and the pricing.

But I think we're some way from that as of now.

**(Laura Conaway):**
How does this affect sort of ordinary walking around life? What are the sort of trickle down or ripple out effects?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
Well, if the government succeeds in refloating the financial system, then I think what it will suggest is less of an effect over the next couple of years in terms of access to loans.

So student loans will not become excessively costly, mortgages will not become excessively costly, and they'll be relatively easy to get. Loans to small businesses will still be available.

If, however, a substantial portion of the financial system is troubled and tries to shrink its balance sheet, then you could have what is called a very severe credit crunch, in which case they'll become unwilling to lend, and small businesses will have to shut down some of them, and ordinary retail credit that many of us benefit from, credit cards, student loans, and so on, will become harder to get.

So it will impact the ordinary citizen if this gets out of hand.

**(Laura Conaway):**
It feels like, in moving toward a hypothetical intervention by the government, that there are a couple of missed opportunities.

One is the opportunity to get Wall Street to reform itself by making Wall Street go out to its own shareholders and saying, we need to recapitalize, we've gotta get more money into these lending institutions.

And the second is that, in a broader sense, the trillion dollars is really, it's a, if you divide it up by all sorts of taxpayers, by all the taxpayers in the country, what they're kinda hoping is that we won't notice it quite so much at the granular level at each household, but there's a missed opportunity in terms of what else could be invested in with that money.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
The real issue is absolutely what you just said, that could we have taken action earlier? And to some extent, I think all of us, and I have to admit hindsight is 20-20, have been surprised by the level of the problems and the virulence of the market once it recognized the problems.

So I would say, yes, there is a regulatory lapse. They should have asked these banks to recapitalize more forcefully early on. They did not, and so it has come back to the taxpayer. But I would also say that many of us, including academics who don't have skin in the game, thought that this was actually a crisis, but not as deep as we have just seen it become.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Raghurajan, thank you so much.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
You're most welcome.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And that's Planet Money for today. Wow, what a place.

Adam's off talking to our bosses at NPR, and we're trying to figure out what in the heck this mega bailout might mean.

Thanks for listening in, Friday, September 19th.

Take care.
