**(Adam Davidson):**
Hi, and welcome to the Planet Money Podcast. I'm Adam Davidson, here with Laura Conaway.
How are you doing?
Dan Costello.
Hey there.
And Alex Bloomberg.
Hello.
Today is Tuesday, September 23rd. It's 5.34 p.m. Dan, quickly, where are we in the
news?
The biggest thing that happened today is that Paulson Bernanke met with the Senate
Finance Committee and received a testy reception.
This was not the welcome that they had hoped, the we're going to just pass the bill that
the president sent, no matter what.
Far from it, yeah. There was a bit of skepticism about the timing of when, most people think
this will pass, but skepticism about the timing of it and exactly what it's going
to look like.
Was Jim Bunning in full effect?
He was in full effect. I think he called un-American, and this was socialism.
Oh, I was wondering what you were going to say. Was the S-word used?
It was used. Took a little while to get there, but it came out.
But we don't know what the bill will look like. We don't have, I mean, we've heard
a lot of possibilities, but we don't yet know where they're going to shoot.
Yeah, at the end of the day, Paulson didn't back down. I mean, he really stood firm
and he didn't give many specifics, which is exactly what he says. He wants, as he
says, to have this pass quickly, get on the ground running, and not be stymied
by any of these other additions to the bill.
And Laura, you just blogged something out of the White House?
Yeah, I did. There was a press gaggle phone call today, and Tony Fratto, deputy
press chief of the White House, said that this bill, which I have actually been
thinking of as sort of quite hastily drawn together, had been considered by
any number of policy people actually for months.
The two-page bill?
Yeah, that the policy implications of this had been worked out by certain
members of the policy staff for months.
Wow. So we're going to play some interviews today. Yesterday, I got a
chance to catch up with Tim Adams. He used to work for Henry Paulson in
the Treasury Department. Tim Adams was undersecretary for International
Affairs at Treasury. He's now in private consultation with the Lindsay
Group. I know you've been a close advisor to the president even before he
was president, and you worked hard to get him elected and re-elected.
Right, right.
It looks like, I mean, it's hard to give a huge ringing endorsement to his
economic policies. How do we weigh that? What did he get wrong? What did
you get wrong?
Well, I think everyone makes mistakes. We're human, and you certainly, it's
easy to Monday morning quarterback lots of different decisions. But I think
we are where we are because of 20 or 30 years, as we described at the
top of the show, 20 or 30 years worth of decisions. And some were made
in this administration, some in previous administrations. Remember, in
the late 90s, we had the dot com tech bubble, which was the largest equity
bubble, if you measure it on a PE basis, the largest equity bubble since
the 1920s. So our system is prone to bubbles, as are most systems.
And we just think about, we need to think about how do you respond to
them, but more importantly, how do you prepare for them? And that's the
real task going forward that I think Congress won't wrestle with so much
this week, but next year, they'll wrestle with how do you build a new
regulatory structure and system for 21st century finance?
I feel like you dodged my question a little bit.
I did dodge it. But I think there's a lot of blame to go around.
I think the system itself had lots of failures. I think the incentives
were wrong for a lot of the players. I think there were a lot of
regulatory entities that should have done a better job, not only in this
administration, previous administrations. I think we changed laws in ways that
had unintended consequences.
Can you give an example?
Well, we lift the leverage ratios in 2004 when Mr. Donaldson was head of
the SEC, and we didn't think enough about what that meant for the
unregulated institutions such as investment banks.
And just to explain what that means to listeners who might not be
familiar, that means if it used to be if an investment bank had 100
bucks, they could lend out, I think it was 12 to 1, they could lend
out 1,200 bucks, then you lifted the restrictions and they could lend
out 3,000 bucks, 30 to 1, which now, at least, I mean, with the
benefit of hindsight, looks like a dangerously highly leveraged
situation. Is that fair to...?
Indeed. I think you had a lot of people who were in institutions
were buying and selling and rating instruments that they just didn't
understand. We didn't understand the complexities associated with them.
And I think what we're now finding out is that we didn't understand them.
And it was, again, a failure across the system. It was a failure.
The rating agencies understand it was failure of management in many of
these institutions, which were handsomely compensated, but failure
of management to understand what they were buying and holding and selling.
And you had a lot of institutions that were making loans and then
simply securitizing them and getting them off their books.
So they didn't have the incentive to ensure that it was good quality lending.
What did you get most wrong, personally? What did you not understand,
that you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself?
You know, I think all too often, we look at the trees rather than
the entire system. And it's easy for the different regulators to go
into the entities they regulated and to look at specific practices that
caused them problems. But there wasn't enough attention paid to the
whole system being in question. And because we assumed the whole
system would work itself out, that if there were problems,
it would be an institutional specific or just one node in the supply
chain. But in fact, the entire supply chain failed.
And I think it was just we were... And by entire supply chain,
basically what you're saying is you thought, okay, there's a chance that
one investment bank or four banks or whatever will collapse,
but that the whole system of money moving around the country and around
the world, that was fundamentally sound. That was solid as a rock.
Right. We just all assumed that everyone knew what they were buying
and selling and that the computer models that were in the basements
of a lot of these institutions and the guys who wanted to be physicists
but couldn't and ended up creating these models, that they really
captured the full range of risk in the various outcomes, the so-called
fat tail distributions of potential outcomes, and that they would
understand what those different outcomes would look like and would
manage to them. But in fact, we didn't. And they were just far
too complex and people just didn't understand them. And after a while,
I think they quit trying. Wow. Wow. They quit trying. It's Alex
Bloomberg, Adam's partner in Planet Money. And Adam, you and I
talked yesterday to Brad Setzer, who's at the Council on Foreign
Relations, and he is a former Treasury official under Clinton.
And we brought him in so that you could ask him about one
specific part of this proposed bill from the White House,
this proposed $700 billion bailout bill. Section 10, maximum
amount of authorized purchases. The secretary's authority to
purchase troubled assets under this act shall be limited to
$700 billion, outstanding at any one time. And the main thing I
want to get out of this conversation with you is how much
is $700 billion? How should we think about that? And what will
that do to the dollar, to me, to our listeners? So first of
all, what is $700 billion? Is that real money? Or is that
play money for, you know, I know a million dollars means
nothing to the, when you're thinking about the global
economy, $100 million means nothing. Does $700 billion mean
nothing?
No, $700 billion is a very large sum. It's, it's equal,
it's more than the US oil import bill.
Even for a year, for a year, significantly more,
even at these massive, even at these massive prices. It is
so the government could have just bought us all as much
gas as we want it. And given it to us. All right. If you
want to sort of a simple visual, yeah. It's equal to
the entire US trade and current account deficit. So it's the
equal to the amount that we borrow from the rest of the
world in every given year, which is a very large sum. So I
think by any measure, this is a, it's about 5% of US GDP.
It's a, it's real money.
Does anybody besides the US government have $700 billion
domestically? Or is that just, is that a sum that only
governments have?
Well, the US government doesn't actually have $700
billion. It has the ability to borrow $700 billion and has
the ability to promise with credibility to repay someone
$700 billion plus interest. Right. But some years out.
But could ExxonMobil.exxonmobil or GE, they
couldn't, that's, this is a sum that's beyond. There's no
one company. There's no, even one industry really, that
could get $700 billion together.
Well, I mean, the oil industry probably would be the
closest because oil, selling oil is a very profitable business
right now. And if you, if the oil industry went out
and borrowed a ton of money, sort of took its entire
profits, borrowed some more from the banks who are willing
to lend to oil companies, because, you know, oils were
something, then you could maybe mobilize a fund of this
size. But, you know, a big investment bank would have a
balance sheet of roughly a trillion dollars, a big, very
leveraged investment bank. And that doesn't mean that
they have a trillion dollars they can give away
willy nilly. That's their entire portfolio. And part of
the problem is that a big part of that portfolio is
illiquid, meaning that they can't sell, sell off something
that they currently hold.
When I think of illiquidity, I think liquid is cash in your
pocket. Eliquid is your house. It's worth something, but
you can't give it to someone. You have to do a lot of
stuff.
I think it's even worse in your house, because this is
assets, claims on your house. And since no one knows
quite what you could sell your house for, particularly
now, they don't really know what a bundle of the
mortgages on a whole bunch of different houses is worth.
So it's like your house cubed.
And how many countries? I mean, Japan could borrow
700 billion.
Yes, Japan could borrow that.
Could Great Britain?
Great Britain, it'd be, could they probably, but it
would be, you're getting above 10% of the GDP, well
above 10% of the GDP of any major European country. So
it'd be a phenomenal sum.
Now, he did say there is one country, Alex, if you
remember, one country that actually has 700 billion
and I guess I will guess China, China could give us
that 700 billion and in some ways will lend it to
us, which I find totally I can't I'm still staggered
by that. Literally, there's three entities on earth, if
you don't count the oil industry, three entities on
earth that could borrow $700 billion, the United
States, Japan and China, and only one of them
actually has it, which is China, which is
interesting, because throughout history, as I
understand it, and maybe parts of my details are
wrong, but generally, the richest country at any
given time, whether that was Spain at one time or
Portugal or the United Kingdom or the United
States for a long time, the rich country always
had money that it would lend to poor countries
and the situation where we have a poor country
lending us money is highly unusual.
I've got a listener question today from Leah
Drillius of St. Paul, Minnesota. She's looking
at the $700 billion bailout bill, and she's
looking at one part of it in particular.
I've read that the administration is balking at
the idea of cutting out golden parachutes for
banking executives. And I'm trying to figure out
if there's a reason beyond protecting special
interests that they'd be doing that. So there's
an economic reason such as some sort of
variation of supply side economics, you know,
if these executives walk away with all this
money, that'll somehow benefit the taxpayer.
Otherwise, I can't see the justification in it.
That's a really good question.
It's an excellent question, Leah. And I'll just
say quickly, the argument is not that it
benefits the economy by giving these
executives millions of dollars that they would
then spend on stuff. The argument is if we
cut their pay, then banks that are in a
shaky position are less likely to participate
because the executives aren't going to want
to participate in this buyout because they
don't want to lose their salary.
That strikes me as just such a bogus argument,
though, because I mean, if banks that are in
a shaky position will end up like Lehman
Brothers, you know, I mean, isn't.
But if you're on the fence and if you're
an executive, you're I mean, maybe some of
them are thinking about the company itself,
but some might look at a job offer from
Google or someone else. You know what I
mean? These are the very people whose
expertise you need right now.
So they literally they will say they're
worried about people saying, screw it. I
don't care about the global economy.
I don't care about my own company.
If I don't get my 22 million dollar
walking bonus, I'm going to go away.
I mean, it's basic. Look, economics is
the science of partially the science of
incentives. And I don't it's not a
moral. Well, actually, that's not true.
Adam Smith called it a moral science.
Right. Theory of moral sentiments was
one of his main books. But but but the
point is not economics does not talk
about the moral better parts of our
nature. It talks about our incentives.
And if you take away an incentive to for
an individual to benefit themselves,
it's remarkable how easy it is for
individuals to convince themselves that
what's in their own best interest.
At the street level, a lot of people
would like to offer these bankers an
incentive to leave.
Yeah. And I also don't feel like
they're in any sort of negotiating
position at this point. Like you can't
like who really like you're you're
you're coming to the government for the
government to bail you out, basically.
And you're going to demand, you know,
executive pay. It doesn't seem like
from a purely economic point of view,
it doesn't seem like that.
Right. From a purely economic point
of view, I mean, not to get
wonky, but if you it's a labor
market issue. I mean, if you don't
pay these people enough money, they
could leave to other industries or
realize that they don't have enough
skin in the game to go through the
next six months or 12 months or two
years. Right. And clearly they've
been going to be brutal in all
ways. Wait a second.
Wait a second. I mean, there is
hard to find. There are clearly many
people on Wall Street who have made
colossal errors.
Sure. I'm sure some of them are
schmucks.
Some of them are right.
They're a fair amount of
responsibility. I think a fair
amount of them probably don't.
There's a news bit, though.
Dan, they're talking about this
tomorrow on the Hill, right?
This executive pay thing.
Yeah. And they're probably not
getting it much farther on the
issue than we've gotten here at
the table. I mean, it's it's one
of these talking points.
It gets a lot of people fired up.
But the question is, it makes you
mad. But what do you do about it?
All right. Well, this has been

It’s 5:34 PM Dan quickly where are we in the news Today is the Polson Bernanke receiving reception this was not the welcome to stay at. Hope the we’re going to just pass the bill that the president sent no matter what far from it. Yeah, it was about the timing of the wind timing of it and was Jim Bunning, and Pulisic. He was in full affect Rika? un-American , but we don’t know what the deal will look like we don’t have any. We’ve heard a lot of possibilities but we don’t yet know where they are. Yeah, at the end of a possum conduct out really stood firm and he didn’t give me exactly what he says he wants as he says to have this pass quickly get on the ground running and not be standby  And Laurie you just block something about the white something out of the White House yeah I did. There was Chris Gago phone call today Antoni Fredo, deputy press, chief of the White House said that quite hastily drawn together has been considered by any number of policy people actually for months to page yeah, the deposit because of this had been worked out by certain members of the policy staff for months , so we’re gonna play some interviews today yesterday got a chance to catch up with Tim Adams. He used to work for Henry Paulson Adams was under secretary for international treasury is now a private in private consultation with and with the Lindsay. I know you’ve been a close advisor to the president before he was president, right  Now and then you he worked hard to get them elected and reelected right track it you know it it looks like it is hard to give a huge ringing the doors economic policies. How do we wait? What did he get wrong way? I think everyone likes him for humans and you you certainly , I think we are where we are because of 20 or 30 years and some were made in as the.com tech Bubba which was the largest equity bubble if you took our system and we just think about how do you respond to them in here for them and that’s the real attachment  This week but next year they’ll wrestle with how do you build a new regulatory structure in the system for 20%? I feel like you’re dodging my questions I little bit I think there’s a lot of wrong and for a lot of the players I think they were a lot of regulatory at her job none of the consequences. Can you give an example well we play we lift the delivery ratios in 2004 when you , didn’t think about enough about what that bitch for the unregulated. I just explain what that means familiar that means if used to be in it if an investment bank had 100 bucks they could lend a 12 to one they could lend out the thousand 200 bucks then you lifted the restrictions and they could lend out 3000 bucks 30 to one which now at least  Looks like a dangerously highly leveraged. You had a lot of people who were fusions for buying and selling and in writing instruments and understand the complexity selfie with them and founding out. Is it management jelly and I am at we’re making love in Chipley sure that it was good quality windy. What did you get my person? What did you not understand? If you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself you know we we we look at the you look at the trees rather than this entire system and it’s easy trip  is easy for the different regulators to go into the entities be regulated, and he look at the typical practices to causing problems, but it wasn’t enough pages. The whole system question and system, so it would work itself out if there were problems, it would be a hint civic or just one node in the supply chain failed, and I think it was just we were , OK there’s a chance of one investment banker for banks, or whatever will collapse, but but that the whole system of money moving around the country and around the world that was fundamentally Sinta that was solid. Everyone knew what they were buying and selling in the day of the computer models  if you wanted this really capture the full range of risk in the berries Alka so cool that hail distributions it and it would they would understand what is different and complexity try wow wow you quit track of Adam you and I talked yesterday to Brad on formulations, and he is  And you bought a mansion so that you could ask him a very about one specific part of the proposed bill section 10 maximum amount of authorize purchases the secretaries authority to purchase troubled assets under the sac show me shall be limited to $700 billion outstanding at any one time and the main thing I want to get out of this conversation with you is how much is $700 million. How should we think about that and what will that do to the dollar to meet Her  Listeners what is 700 billion is that real money or is that play money from you know I know $1 million means nothing to them $100 million with nothing to 700 billion me nothing no it’s equal it’s more than you as well in portal for a year for your significant more even at these massive even at these massive prices it is so the government could’ve just bought us all week  if you want to sort of a simple visual out it’s equal to the entire US the people to the amount we borrow by any measure does anybody besides the US government have $700 billion in Mexico what US government doesn’t actually have $700 billion as he ability to borrow rest $700 billion  Due to promise with credibility three pay, someone $700 billion right but I’m yours out book at Exxon mobile Exxon Mobil OMG E they couldn’t that’s this is the song that beyond is this it is there’s no one company there’s no $700 billion together well, I’m in the oil industry probably will be the closest Cazuela  if he oil industry went out and borrowed a ton of money, took his entire profits borrowed some more from the banks were willing to enter welcome yeah then you could maybe mobilize a big investment big berry library‘s it means they have $1 trillion if you get a higher portfolio, is it a big part of that portfolio is a liquid  They can’t sell so often when I think of illiquidity I think liquid is cash in your pocket illiquid is your house is worth something but you can’t give it to someone to do a lot of stuff and it’s even worse in your house because this is assets claims on your house and since no one knows quite with your house for now they don’t really know a bundle of the mortgages. A whole bunch of different houses is worth so it’s like your house cute how many countries in Japan could borrow 700 billion in great Britain it be could they probably but it would be getting above 10% of the GDP well above 10%  Phenomenal song now he did say there is one country Alex if you remember one country that actually has 700 billion China could give us at 700 billion then I can still stagger by that entities on earth and only one of them actually has it throughout history as I understand it and maybe wrong, but generally the richest country at any given time being at one time Portugal, whole United Kingdom with United States. From a long time the rich country always had one what country  I’ve got a listen. Her question today with Julius Saint Paul Minnesota. She’s looking at the $730 bill out bill and she’s looking at one part of it. In particular the idea of holding her shoes were and I’m trying to figure out if there’s an economic . As executives walk away with all this money that’ll somehow benefit Bapak fair otherwise I can’t do the job question Leah and quickly to the argument it’s not that it’s benefits economy by giving these executives millions of dollars to spend on Septi argument is Hiten cut their Paden banks that are in the shaky position are less likely to participate because the executives aren’t gonna want to participate in this buyout because I don’t want to  Worry that’s well you know any business but if you were on the fence in a few companies look at a job or someone else right now, so they literally they will say that they’re worried about people saying screw it I don’t care about the global economy I don’t care about my own company. If I don’t get my $20 million walking bonus, I’m gonna go away  And sciences yeah and I don’t it’s not a moral well actually that’s not true Adam Smith Kali tomorrow is Maine bucks, but but but the point is not economics does not talk about the moral better parts of our nature and talks about our incentives and if you take away two for an individual to benefit themselves, it’s remarkable how easy it is for individuals  at the street level a lot of people would like to offer these bankers and then send it to me yeah and I also don’t feel like they’re in any sort of negotiation like you’re you’re you’re coming to the government for the government to bail you out basically and you’re gonna demand you know  he doesn’t like it from a purely economic point of you. It doesn’t seem like that right on a human. If you don’t pay money than six months or 12 months to you right clearly many people on Wall Street who make colossal errors I’m sure some of them are schmucks some of them aren’t there a fair amount of responsibility I think Fairmount of a problem , they’re talking about this tomorrow on the hill right from Megan get much farther on the issue then all right well this has been planet money podcast for Tuesday, September 23. I’m Adam Davidson thank you to work on her way down Costello and Alex Bloomberg we have so much analysis observations, funny stuff podcasts all sorts of stuff at npr.org/
