Hi Adam David Silva national public radio money podcast it is September 22 this Monday at 11:36 AM. We’re having to say exactly when we are talking this week because things are moving so quickly that now Mike’s mini oven changed by the time podcast right now the looking at the legislative proposal from the treasury department to congress just a few minutes ago. Senator Chris died his Democratic response a separate bill. We thought it would be fabulous to hear from John Macy, who is definitely in Avila school and more to the point  reading specialist in business law banking law, the interaction between the government and the banking and financial system. Call Janet. It sounds like an interesting week for someone with all of those specialties. The most interesting I’ve ever had. In fact, I would say oh by the way, I should mention work on the way. Of course this morning is here  has been entire life studying banking and securities law and my hunch is your sort of everything you do is looking at decisions made in the 1930s that have impacted your entire lifetime. Sure there have been the changes since then but relieved quart room feet of American commerce the cord live with that then and you weren’t around then and you might’ve felt well. I’ll never be around for. That historic no long is that , that’s exactly right this is this is important is the events of the 1930s and in Nl any any remorse I felt nothing around then can we drop in on one particular part of this which is the power shift but I look at the early going of this is Phil it feels to me like there’s an awful lot of power that Congress is heading over to the treasury secretary, and I’d like to read  if that’s OK to proposal for treasury authority to purchase troubled SS draft nine 2108 this came out yesterday, Sunday evening and they’re coming at the trouble asset relief act Tara section 2 paragraph be necessary actions the secretary of treasury secretary is author to is authorized to take such actions as a second secretary, deems necessary to carry out the authorities in this act without limitation  really strong language without limitation very strong language that the one thing that we learned from this document is that something new about the balance of power opportunity for Congress they rarely have the opportunity to policy making it to 54 constitutional context is is, this is this bill constitutional and Congress give this much power to the executive shouldn’t there be checks and balances will fit the the  watching the checks and balances that is the response by people like Nancy Pelosi‘s power that’s their constitutional prerogative, but if they if they give it up we’re talking about the treasury secretary buying some ass is it really that big of power shift is basically been given a credit card however, you want but you can’t warranty can’t patriot I can’t listen in on our phone calls a minute is it really that big of power shit it is because he basically is given the power to shape the Economy  is able to decide which financial institutions get to survive and we don’t get to survive and there’s no there’s no a limitation with respect to figure me out the price or to the kind of financial institutions that are included sample. We’re following this believe that this is about financial institutions, the way that the 1930s regulations  expect broader than that for example did leave the automobile company at the plenary authority to determine the winners and losers in the economy. Can you give us a another example history of this kind of power shift? No, the even the even the declaration of war still brought with it , if not for anything else because Congress retain the ability to authorize spending isolation, if you look at section 10, the mat maximum amount of this is this includes the authority to spin the the other section. It really caught. My eye was in a lot of other people that I was section 12 I’m gonna read that decisions by the secretary, treasury secretary, pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion. Meaning, of course , and no injunction or other form of equitable relief may be issued by any court of law or any administrative agency is is that unusual or is that kind of standard bureaucratic language? It’s very unusual it’s it is it is constitution gives Congress the power to find him a of the of the federal courts, so the  section is limited or non-reviewable of a glimmer Persian into this. Do you know of any other build it that says this someone in the government can never be reviewed in anyway not an economic may be some legislation national security, but nothing related to the economy I want to read an email you sent me earlier today OK this email was I don’t think that there is ever been such a powershift evening time of war and that’s because you think of in war there is oversight. This is truly unprecedented I don’t think any other administration would’ve had the Hotspur to do this even Nixon Roosevelt would find it amusing, but he wouldn’t have dreamed of going this far. Push pause it, obviously want Congress way way out of the loop for some reason , I was gonna ask if you agree with that but you wrote wrote it and I stand by it yes I do Adam because imagine you’re going through a partner you’ve been working with the last 200 years well I want to remove you from the fire but you don’t have any more power  to the power of the purse it’s it’s incredible to think that that essentially executive branch can walk Congress into me what it is into we’re going to get a whole new economic landscape and I think a whole new political landscape as well. Laura because that is when you have a real crisis, a way to deal with the way unilateral  that’s what really so remarkable about this. It says you Congress you’re only gonna be sending the gears of our efforts to fix this problem so you got to get out of our way are you or your part of the problem and as far as I can tell her we wanna push back a little bit but we certainly understand we can’t get in the way of this.

Hi. I'm Adam Davidson with National Public Radio's Planet Money Podcast. It is September
22nd. It's Monday at 11 36 a.m. We're having to say exactly when we are talking this week
because things are moving so quickly that what we say now might, many of it, much
of it might change by the time you listen to this podcast. Right now we are looking
at the legislative proposal from the Treasury Department to Congress. Just a few minutes
ago Senator Chris Dodd gave his sort of democratic response, a separate bill. We thought it would
be fabulous to hear from John Macy who is deputy dean of Yale Law School and more
to the point a leading specialist in business law, banking law, the interaction between
the government and the banking and financial system. Boy John, it sounds like an interesting
week for someone with all of those specialties. It is an interesting week, the most interesting
I've ever had in fact I would say in terms of my own academic specialties. Oh
by the way I should mention Laura Conaway of course is here. Good morning Laura. So John I
was thinking that a guy like you who has spent, you've spent your entire life studying banking
and securities law and my hunch is you're sort of, everything you do is looking at decisions
made in the 1930s that have impacted your entire lifetime. Sure there have been big
changes since then but really the core drum beat of American commerce, the core laws were set then
and you weren't around then and you might have felt well I'll never be around for a period that
historic, no longer. Is that, am I right on that? That's exactly right. This is just as
important and just as historic as the events of the 1930s and any remorse I felt had
not been around then I feel as though it's been compensated for. Can we jump in on one
particular part of this which is the power shift. When I look at the early going of
this bill it feels to me like there's an awful lot of power that Congress is handing
over to the Treasury Secretary. And I'd like to read if that's okay. Yeah go for it Adam.
This is the legislative proposal for Treasury authority to purchase troubled assets draft
921.08. This came out yesterday, Sunday evening, and they're calling it the Trouble Asset Relief
Act. Tara, section two, paragraph B, necessary actions. The Secretary, of course meaning the
Treasury Secretary, is authorized to take such actions as the Secretary deems necessary to
carry out the authorities in this act without limitation. That strikes me as really strong
language without limitation. It is very strong language. The one thing that we learned from
this document is that is something new about the balance of powers that that wasn't so clear
before which is that the balance of powers is really an opportunity for Congress and they
rarely have failed in the past to avail themselves of the opportunity to to assert
themselves and their policymaking and influence policymaking. And obviously what this legislation
is is a gambit to to deprive, essentially to deprive Congress of that for at least with
respect to the economy. So placing this in a sort of constitutional context. First of all,
is this, just at a first read, is this bill constitutional? Can Congress give this much
power to the executive? Shouldn't there be checks and balances? Well, we're watching the
checks and balances. That is, you know, the response by people like Nancy Pelosi and Chris
Dodd saying, well, we don't want to give up this power. You know, that's their constitutional
prerogative. But if they give it up, no one's going to second-guess that decision. At least,
you know, the courts are not going to do so and certainly the executive branch isn't. We're
talking about the Treasury Secretary buying some assets. I mean, sure, it's a lot of assets,
but is it really that big a power shift? He's basically being given a, you know, a credit card
and told, all right, go spend it however you want. But he can't declare war. He can't,
you know, it's not the Patriot Act. He can't listen in on our phone calls. I mean,
it's, is this really that big a power shift? It is because he basically is given the power
to shape the economy in the sense that he is able to decide which financial institutions get
to survive and which financial institutions don't get to survive. There's no limitation
with respect to figuring out the price or to the kind of financial institutions that are
included. So, for example, you know, people typically kind of, most people who are following
this believe that this is about financial institutions, the way that the 1930s regulation
Glass-Steagall was about was about banks. But this is much broader than that. For example,
under this legislation, the automobile companies, the big three auto companies would not have to go
to Congress for a bailout. The Treasury could just buy their bad assets and put money into
them that way. So, basically, this is turning over to the Treasury plenary authority to
determine the winners and losers in the economy. Can you give us any other example
in history of this kind of power shift? No. Anything that's big? No. No. I mean, even the,
even the, you know, the Patriot Act or even the, you know, declaration of war
still brought with it a substantial oversight, if not for anything else, because
Congress retained the ability to, you know, authorize spending. But, you know, of course,
in this legislation, if you look at section 10, the maximum amount of authorized purchases,
this includes the authority to spend, you know, the $700 billion that's been so much in the press.
The other section that really caught my eye was, and a lot of other people's eye,
was section 12. And I'm going to read that. Decisions by the Secretary, again, Treasury
Secretary, pursuant to the authority of this act are non-reviewable and committed to agency
discretion, meaning, of course, I guess, the Department of the Treasury, and no injunction
or other form of equitable relief may be issued by any court of law or any administrative agency.
I mean, is that unusual or is that kind of standard bureaucratic language?
It's very unusual. It is essentially, I think, constitutional in the sense that,
that, you know, the Constitution gives Congress the power to define the jurisdiction
of the federal courts. So, to the extent that the section is limited in the sense that only
decisions by the Secretary are non-reviewable. So that leaves a little bit of a glimmer for some
judicial incursion into this. But do you know of any other bill that says this,
someone in the government can never be reviewed in any way?
No, not in economic legislation. There may be some, you know, legislation. I'm unfamiliar with
respect to national security. But nothing related to the economy has ever had a provision
anything like this. I want to read an email you sent me earlier today. Okay. This email was,
I don't think that there has ever been such a power shift, even in time of war. And that's
because you think in war there is oversight. This is truly unprecedented. I don't think any
other administration would have had the Chutzpah to do this, even Nixon. Roosevelt would find
it amusing, but he wouldn't have dreamed of going this far. Bush-Polson obviously want
Congress way, way out of the loop for some reason. I was going to ask if you agree with
that, but you wrote it. So I wrote it and I stand by it. Yes, I do, Adam. What do you
mean by Chutzpah? I'm going to use some Yiddish. Why is this Chutzpah, Dick?
Okay. Well, it's Chutzpah because the main reason is because, and perhaps the reason
no other president would have attempted this, is nobody would have thought it would succeed.
Imagine you're going to a partner you've been working with the last 200 years, 250 years,
and you say, well, I want to remove you from, I'm not going to fire you. You still have
your job. You can still be called Congress, but you don't have any more power. And certainly
with respect to the power of the purse, you're just going to give us a blank check.
It's incredible to think that essentially the executive branch can bluff Congress into,
or play a chicken game with Congress, which is really what it is, into abdicating their core
legislative powers. So we're going to get a whole new economic landscape out of this.
And I think that's right. And I think a whole new political landscape as well, Laura,
because the message this sends is that from a sort of political science point of view is
when you have real crisis, the way to deal with it is to get Congress out of the way
and let the president act unilaterally. That's what's really so remarkable about this. It says,
you, Congress, you're only going to be sand in the gears of our efforts to fix this problem.
So you got to get out of our way or you're part of the problem. And as far as I can tell,
the leadership in Congress seems persuaded because they're saying, well, we want to
push back a little bit, but we certainly understand we can't get in the way of this.
Thank you so much, John Macy of Yale Law School. And thank you, Laura Kanaway of Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson with NPR's Planet Money Crisis. Week three coverage continues at npr.org.
Thank you.
