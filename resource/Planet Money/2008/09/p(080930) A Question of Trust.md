As Congress continues to talk about a possible rescue of Wall Street, the stock market bounces back a little. One voter tells us everyone is looking out for themselves, while two economists look for a bailout the public would be willing to buy.

Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money podcast. 

Today is Tuesday, September 30th. It's about 547 here in New York. It's Eastern Time. I'm Laura Conaway. 

The news today is a little more mixed than yesterday. The stock market remains an e-ticket rollercoaster. Yesterday it fell 778 points after Congress spiked that big Wall Street bailout. Today, there's word that Congress will keep working on some kind of rescue plan. The stock market rose 485 points. I guess they like that. 

To me, the big picture here is that ordinary people don't know what's going to happen. They don't know whether the doomsday crowd is right in saying that if there's no bailout, we're going off the cliff. They don't know whether the bailout was wrong or whether it was the wrong form of something that needed to happen. They just don't know who to trust. 

Here's Planet Money listener Terry Weiss of Dayton, Ohio. 

**(Terry Weiss):**
My gut reacts to it. And the way that I hear all of my co-workers and friends talking, we think it's a bad idea. 

We know that something has to happen, but this feels insanely rushed and the ideas are coming from people that frankly we don't trust right now.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Is there anyone you do trust right now? 

**(Terry Weiss):**
I would have to say, I don't know. 

I mean, that's a really horrible way to feel. I feel like we're caught between people who gave us bad advice, people who thought up these stupid investment tools that they had no idea what was going to happen when they fell apart. And then we're looking at a new president with a new administration. 

So we feel like squeezed in between all this.

**(Laura Conaway):**
When I look out at the political landscape right this second, what I see is a world in which, as you say, no one feels that they can trust anyone.

**(Terry Weiss):**
Well, I think that that was demonstrated even by the, I heard different things about how some of the investment banks, nobody even wanted to lend amongst themselves because they didn't trust each other. 

Right now, people are kind of looking out for themselves.

I mean, when I hear things, you hear somebody on television saying, never get panicked, never sell. It'll always get better. 

I don't necessarily believe that anymore because those are the people that were walking around looking like deer in the headlight. Like, what in the world's going on? 

And then you see footage of the traders on the floor, you know, cursing at people in Congress, what are those idiots doing? They should be shot for this. 

Well, how do we know that this was even the right thing? Maybe it was best for that investor, but maybe it's not best for me. Maybe it's not best for my kids.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Do you trust Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke?

**(Terry Weiss):**
Probably not as much as I should.

**(Laura Conaway):**
How about Henry Paulson?

**(Terry Weiss):**
No, not at all.

**(Laura Conaway):**
President Bush?

**(Terry Weiss):**
Depends on who he's listening to at the time.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Nancy Pelosi?

**(Terry Weiss):**
Absolutely not.

**(Laura Conaway):**
You're running out of people.

**(Terry Weiss):**
I know I am, and that's frustrating.

**(Laura Conaway):**
That was Terry Weiss, a mom who works as a proofreader in Dayton.

Next, I turn to John Macy. He's a deputy dean at Yale Law School. He's also an economist. We've had him on the show before.

When I found John Macy today, he was sitting in the dentist chair. He says the government needs to do something, but it needs a lot better pitch to the public. Macy reached back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the Great Depression, for an example.

**(John Macy):**
The sales of the bailout bill have been made on the following basis.

Number one, they say Main Street and Wall Street are joined at the hip, and what's good for Wall Street is good for Main Street.

Number two, they've been saying, if you don't pass this, you just don't get it, suggesting that people are naive or unsophisticated if they don't get this.

You know, I think that any gains to Main Street are extremely tangential at best, and I think the disapproval by the House illustrates that fact.

I think we're having what can only be described as a populist moment right now in the United States, and I don't think that the people who were ineptly selling this bailout bill have any idea of about who they're selling it to or what people are thinking.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Do you yourself believe there needs to be some kind of government intervention here?

**(John Macy):**
Yes.

**(Laura Conaway):**
How would you then go about selling that government intervention to the American people?

**(John Macy):**
Well, I think that you have to predicate the plan on some kind of bottom-up rather than top-down stimulus.

The idea that you're going to bail out the banks who got into this mess as opposed to the mortgage holders, I think it's just misguided.

It might be convenient for the Secretary of the Treasury or the Chairman of the Fed, but it's misguided from a political standpoint or from an equity standpoint or from a kind of a fairness and justice standpoint.

So I think you have to do something for the people who got stocked with all these very strange mortgages and variable-rate mortgages of kind of infinite variety.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So in other words, you're saying that you need a bill that would no longer be referred to as a Wall Street bailout, but would be referred to as a homeowner bailout?

**(John Macy):**
I don't think it takes a master political analyst to realize that a Wall Street bailout is not a particularly enticing proposition.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Can we talk about what FDR did?

**(John Macy):**
Sure. 

FDR came in and he declared a bank holiday. He shut out the down the banks. That was the very first thing he did.

**(Laura Conaway):**
What year are we talking here?

**(John Macy):**
This is early 30s, 32, 33.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So right in the Depression, FDR comes in and says, bank holiday.

**(John Macy):**
Right.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And proceeds to do what?

**(John Macy):**
Close down the banks so people sort of calm down. Think of the difference, Lyle. This is quite interesting.

FDR came in and his goal was to instill calm into the marketplace, to restore confidence in the financial system, right?

The Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Fed's goal has been to instill panic in the financial system because unless people are panicked, they're not going to vote for this bill.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Right. 

So FDR comes in, he sits down, he starts having fireside chats and saying, okay, people, here's what we're going to do.

**(John Macy):**
Right.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Right? It wasn't a fireside chat.

Wasn't that a big part of sort of selling it?

**(John Macy):**
Yeah, but think about a fireside chat.

We're sitting there calmly, rationally discussing this instead of in front of a fire, calm, soothing voice. So a fireside chat is very different than yelling fire in a crowded capital market.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Thanks to Yale Professor John Macy. We hope the rest of your dentist visit went well.

And finally, I turn to the first economist who ever said to me, hey, there are better ways to save Wall Street than this big bailout bill.

Raghu Rajan teaches at the University of Chicago. Rajan may not have thought much of that particular bailout bill, but he does say the market needs to know help is coming.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
I think the markets need to be reassured that something is being done because right now we have a banking sector which is essentially in a state of panic, unwilling to lend to each other.

We need to be thinking about recapitalizing the banking system, whether through private money or through public money or through some combination.

And I think we will come to that very soon.

**(Laura Conaway):**
How long do we have?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
If people believe that something is on its way and that there is some direct intervention with some of the weakest banks, you could have at least the banking market reviving for a little while. And that will buy us a little bit of time.

But I don't think we have a lot of time. I think that we are at a point where lenders are very, very nervous. And we need to convince them that there is a comprehensive plan underway.

I saw some talk today of the FDIC trying to insure deposits over $100,000, which essentially means that all bank debt is insured. And these are the kinds of measures that are being contemplated.

And if you're contemplating these kinds of measures, I think you're pretty near looking at the whole banking system and deciding whether to temporarily take it over.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Are we looking at a month?

**(Raghu Rajan):**
In terms of time?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah.

**(Raghu Rajan):**
I'd say a couple of weeks without anything being done is about the outer limit.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Raghu Rajan also told me that the government hasn't got to do everything at once. He thinks you could take maybe a series of small steps and that you'd learn something along the way about what was really needed.

That's the Planet Money podcast for today, Tuesday, September 30th.
