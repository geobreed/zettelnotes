**(Adam Davidson):**
Hi, and welcome to the Planet Money Podcast. 

I'm Adam Davidson, here with Laura Conaway.

**(Laura Conaway):**
How are you doing?

**(Adam Davidson):**
Dan Costello.

**(Dan Costello):**
Hey there.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And Alex Bloomberg.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Hello.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Today is Tuesday, September 23rd. It's 5.34 p.m. 

Dan, quickly, where are we in the news?

**(Dan Costello):**
The biggest thing that happened today is that Paulson Bernanke met with the Senate Finance Committee and received a testy reception.

**(Adam Davidson):**
This was not the welcome that they had hoped, the we're going to just pass the bill that the president sent, no matter what.

**(Dan Costello):**
Far from it, yeah. There was a bit of skepticism about the timing of when, most people think this will pass, but skepticism about the timing of it and exactly what it's going to look like.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Was Jim Bunning in full effect?

**(Dan Costello):**
He was in full effect. I think he called un-American, and this was socialism.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Oh, I was wondering what you were going to say. Was the S-word used?

**(Dan Costello):**
It was used. Took a little while to get there, but it came out.

**(Adam Davidson):**
But we don't know what the bill will look like. We don't have, I mean, we've heard a lot of possibilities, but we don't yet know where they're going to shoot.

**(Dan Costello):**
Yeah, at the end of the day, Paulson didn't back down. I mean, he really stood firm and he didn't give many specifics, which is exactly what he says. He wants, as he says, to have this pass quickly, get on the ground running, and not be stymied by any of these other additions to the bill.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And Laura, you just blogged something out of the White House?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah, I did. There was a press gaggle phone call today, and Tony Fratto, deputy press chief of the White House, said that this bill, which I have actually been thinking of as sort of quite hastily drawn together, had been considered by any number of policy people actually for months.

**(Adam Davidson):**
The two-page bill?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah, that the policy implications of this had been worked out by certain members of the policy staff for months.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wow. 

So we're going to play some interviews today. 

Yesterday, I got a chance to catch up with Tim Adams. He used to work for Henry Paulson in the Treasury Department. Tim Adams was undersecretary for International Affairs at Treasury. He's now in private consultation with the Lindsay Group. 

I know you've been a close advisor to the president even before he was president, and you worked hard to get him elected and re-elected.

**(Tim Adams):**
Right, right.

**(Adam Davidson):**
It looks like, I mean, it's hard to give a huge ringing endorsement to his economic policies. How do we weigh that? What did he get wrong? What did you get wrong?

**(Tim Adams):**
Well, I think everyone makes mistakes. We're human, and you certainly, it's easy to Monday morning quarterback lots of different decisions. 

But I think we are where we are because of 20 or 30 years, as we described at the top of the show, 20 or 30 years worth of decisions. And some were made in this administration, some in previous administrations. 

Remember, in the late 90s, we had the dot com tech bubble, which was the largest equity bubble, if you measure it on a PE basis, the largest equity bubble since the 1920s. So our system is prone to bubbles, as are most systems. And we just think about, we need to think about how do you respond to them, but more importantly, how do you prepare for them? 

And that's the real task going forward that I think Congress won't wrestle with so much this week, but next year, they'll wrestle with how do you build a new regulatory structure and system for 21st century finance?

**(Adam Davidson):**
I feel like you dodged my question a little bit.

**(Tim Adams):**
I did dodge it. But I think there's a lot of blame to go around.

I think the system itself had lots of failures. I think the incentives were wrong for a lot of the players. I think there were a lot of regulatory entities that should have done a better job, not only in this administration, previous administrations. I think we changed laws in ways that had unintended consequences.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Can you give an example?

**(Tim Adams):**
Well, we lift the leverage ratios in 2004 when Mr. Donaldson was head of the SEC, and we didn't think enough about what that meant for the unregulated institutions such as investment banks.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And just to explain what that means to listeners who might not be familiar, that means if it used to be if an investment bank had 100 bucks, they could lend out, I think it was 12 to 1, they could lend out 1,200 bucks, then you lifted the restrictions and they could lend out 3,000 bucks, 30 to 1, 

which now, at least, I mean, with the benefit of hindsight, looks like a dangerously highly leveraged situation. Is that fair to...?

**(Tim Adams):**
Indeed. 

I think you had a lot of people who were in institutions were buying and selling and rating instruments that they just didn't understand. We didn't understand the complexities associated with them.

And I think what we're now finding out is that we didn't understand them. And it was, again, a failure across the system. It was a failure. The rating agencies understand it was failure of management in many of these institutions, which were handsomely compensated, but failure of management to understand what they were buying and holding and selling.

And you had a lot of institutions that were making loans and then simply securitizing them and getting them off their books. So they didn't have the incentive to ensure that it was good quality lending.

**(Adam Davidson):**
What did you get most wrong, personally? What did you not understand, that you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself?

**(Tim Adams):**
You know, I think all too often, we look at the trees rather than the entire system. 

And it's easy for the different regulators to go into the entities they regulated and to look at specific practices that caused them problems. 

But there wasn't enough attention paid to the whole system being in question. And because we assumed the whole system would work itself out, that if there were problems, it would be an institutional specific or just one node in the supply chain. 

But in fact, the entire supply chain failed. And I think it was just we were... 

**(Adam Davidson):**
And by entire supply chain, basically what you're saying is you thought, okay, there's a chance that one investment bank or four banks or whatever will collapse, but that the whole system of money moving around the country and around the world, that was fundamentally sound. 

That was solid as a rock.

**(Tim Adams):**
Right. We just all assumed that everyone knew what they were buying and selling and that the computer models that were in the basements of a lot of these institutions and the guys who wanted to be physicists but couldn't and ended up creating these models, that they really captured the full range of risk in the various outcomes, the so-called fat tail distributions of potential outcomes, and that they would understand what those different outcomes would look like and would manage to them. 

But in fact, we didn't. 

And they were just far too complex and people just didn't understand them. And after a while, I think they quit trying. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Wow. 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Wow. They quit trying. 

It's Alex Bloomberg, Adam's partner in Planet Money. 

And Adam, you and I talked yesterday to Brad Setzer, who's at the Council on Foreign Relations, and he is a former Treasury official under Clinton. And we brought him in so that you could ask him about one specific part of this proposed bill from the White House, this proposed $700 billion bailout bill. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Section 10, maximum amount of authorized purchases. The secretary's authority to purchase troubled assets under this act shall be limited to $700 billion, outstanding at any one time. 

And the main thing I want to get out of this conversation with you is how much is $700 billion? 

How should we think about that? And what will that do to the dollar, to me, to our listeners? 

So first of all, what is $700 billion? Is that real money? Or is that play money for, you know, I know a million dollars means nothing to the, when you're thinking about the global economy, $100 million means nothing. 

Does $700 billion mean nothing?

**(Brad Setzer):**
No, $700 billion is a very large sum. It's, it's equal, it's more than the US oil import bill. Even for a year, 

**(Adam Davidson):**
for a year, 

**(Brad Setzer):**
significantly more,

**(Adam Davidson):**
even at these massive, 

**(Brad Setzer):**
even at these massive prices. It is

**(Adam Davidson):**
so the government could have just bought us all as much gas as we want it. 

And given it to us. 

**(Brad Setzer):**
All right. If you want to sort of a simple visual, yeah. It's equal to the entire US trade and current account deficit. So it's the equal to the amount that we borrow from the rest of the world in every given year, which is a very large sum. 

So I think by any measure, this is a, it's about 5% of US GDP.

It's a, it's real money.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Does anybody besides the US government have $700 billion domestically? 

Or is that just, is that a sum that only governments have?

**(Brad Setzer):**
Well, the US government doesn't actually have $700 billion. 

It has the ability to borrow $700 billion and has the ability to promise with credibility to repay someone $700 billion plus interest. 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right. 

**(Brad Setzer):**
But some years out.

**(Adam Davidson):**
But could ExxonMobil.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
exxonmobil or GE, they couldn't, that's, this is a sum that's beyond. 

There's no one company. There's no, even one industry really, that could get $700 billion together.

**(Brad Setzer):**
Well, I mean, the oil industry probably would be the closest because oil, selling oil is a very profitable business right now. And if you, if the oil industry went out and borrowed a ton of money, sort of took its entire profits, borrowed some more from the banks who are willing to lend to oil companies, because, you know, oils were something, then you could maybe mobilize a fund of this size. 

But, you know, a big investment bank would have a balance sheet of roughly a trillion dollars, a big, very leveraged investment bank. 

And that doesn't mean that they have a trillion dollars they can give away willy nilly. That's their entire portfolio. 

And part of the problem is that a big part of that portfolio is illiquid, meaning that they can't sell, sell off something that they currently hold.

**(Adam Davidson):**
When I think of illiquidity, I think liquid is cash in your pocket. Iliquid is your house. It's worth something, but you can't give it to someone. You have to do a lot of stuff.

**(Brad Setzer):**
I think it's even worse in your house, because this is assets, claims on your house. And since no one knows quite what you could sell your house for, particularly now, they don't really know what a bundle of the mortgages on a whole bunch of different houses is worth.

So it's like your house cubed.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And how many countries? I mean, Japan could borrow
700 billion.

**(Brad Setzer):**
Yes, Japan could borrow that.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Could Great Britain?

**(Brad Setzer):**
Great Britain, it'd be, could they probably, but it would be, you're getting above 10% of the GDP, well above 10% of the GDP of any major European country. So it'd be a phenomenal sum.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Now, he did say there is one country, Alex, if you remember, one country that actually has 700 billion and 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
I guess I will guess China, 

**(Adam Davidson):**
China could give us that 700 billion and in some ways will lend it to us, 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
which I find totally I can't I'm still staggered by that. Literally, there's three entities on earth, if you don't count the oil industry, three entities on earth that could borrow $700 billion, the United States, Japan and China, 

**(Adam Davidson):**
and only one of them actually has it, which is China, which is interesting, because throughout history, as I understand it, and maybe parts of my details are wrong, but generally, the richest country at any given time, whether that was Spain at one time or Portugal or the United Kingdom or the United States for a long time, the rich country always had money that it would lend to poor countries and the situation where we have a poor country lending us money is highly unusual.

**(Laura Conaway):**
I've got a listener question today from Leah Drillius of St. Paul, Minnesota. She's looking at the $700 billion bailout bill, and she's looking at one part of it in particular.

**(Leah Drillius):**
I've read that the administration is balking at the idea of cutting out golden parachutes for banking executives. 

And I'm trying to figure out if there's a reason beyond protecting special interests that they'd be doing that. So there's an economic reason such as some sort of variation of supply side economics, you know, if these executives walk away with all this money, that'll somehow benefit the taxpayer.

Otherwise, I can't see the justification in it.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
That's a really good question.

**(Adam Davidson):**
It's an excellent question, Leah. And I'll just say quickly, the argument is not that it benefits the economy by giving these executives millions of dollars that they would then spend on stuff. 

The argument is if we cut their pay, then banks that are in a shaky position are less likely to participate because the executives aren't going to want to participate in this buyout because they don't want to lose their salary.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
That strikes me as just such a bogus argument, though, because I mean, if banks that are in a shaky position will end up like Lehman Brothers, you know, I mean, isn't.

**(Adam Davidson):**
But if you're on the fence 

**(Dan Costello):**
and if you're an executive, you're I mean, maybe some of them are thinking about the company itself, but some might look at a job offer from Google or someone else. You know what I mean? 

These are the very people whose expertise you need right now.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So they literally they will say they're worried about people saying, 

screw it. I don't care about the global economy. I don't care about my own company. If I don't get my 22 million dollar walking bonus, I'm going to go away.

**(Adam Davidson):**
I mean, it's basic. Look, economics is the science of partially the science of incentives. And I don't it's not a moral. 

Well, actually, that's not true. Adam Smith called it a moral science.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Theory of moral sentiments was one of his main books. 

But but but the point is not economics does not talk about the moral better parts of our nature. It talks about our incentives.

And if you take away an incentive to for an individual to benefit themselves, it's remarkable how easy it is for individuals to convince themselves that what's in their own best interest.

**(Laura Conaway):**
At the street level, a lot of people would like to offer these bankers an incentive to leave.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Yeah. And I also don't feel like they're in any sort of negotiating position at this point. 

Like you can't like who really like you're you're you're coming to the government for the government to bail you out, basically.

And you're going to demand, you know, executive pay. 

It doesn't seem like from a purely economic point of view, it doesn't seem like that.

**(Dan Costello):**
Right. 

From a purely economic point of view, I mean, not to get wonky, but if you it's a labor market issue. I mean, if you don't pay these people enough money, they could leave to other industries or realize that they don't have enough skin in the game to go through the next six months or 12 months or two years. 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right. 

And clearly they've been going to be 

**(Dan Costello):**
can be brutal in all ways. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wait a second. Wait a second. I mean, 

**(Laura Conaway):**
there is hard to find. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
There are clearly many people on Wall Street who have made colossal errors.

Sure. I'm sure some of them are schmucks. Some of them are 

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
right.

**(Adam Davidson):**
They're a fair amount of responsibility. I think a fair amount of them probably don't.

**(Laura Conaway):**
There's a news bit, though.

Dan, they're talking about this tomorrow on the Hill, right?

This executive pay thing.

**(Dan Costello):**
Yeah. And they're probably not getting it much farther on the issue than we've gotten here at the table. 

I mean, it's it's one of these talking points. It gets a lot of people fired up.

But the question is, it makes you mad. But what do you do about it?

**(Adam Davidson):**
All right. Well, this has been Planet Money podcast for Tuesday, September 23rd.

I'm Adam Davidson.
