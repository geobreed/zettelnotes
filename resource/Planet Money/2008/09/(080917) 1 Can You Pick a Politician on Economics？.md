Any financial decision consultation need to be done with professional but in a time of crisis there is always actions that come from panic, [[Clouded Judgment Behavior]] like panic sell when market is down.

Government has a lot of move power. By action or inaction, they can hammer a message. But not all received the same, or even being understood correctly. 

About regulation too, the focus on the amount does not alleviate the problem. [[Financial Policy Independence]] has to be maintained to make financial policy free from political use.

[[Economic Bubble Period]] also will always exist as long as capitalism exist.

# Points

- questions answering in September 16th 2008
	- Lehman Brothers has a small rescue package from Barclays Bank
	- AIG supposed to be save by bank consortium but cancelled, waiting for government response
- Retirement money with Solomon Smith Barney, worrying? Should it be taken out and buy gold?
	- consult personal financial advisor
	- usually bad to panic sell
	- stock, mutual fund should be for the long term
	- money in FMFM, already lost though, including Lehman, Merrill Lynch
	- owning gold also don't need to be literal bar but can be paper certificate
- What about potential class action suits from shareholders of Fannie, Freddie, Lehman, Merrill, AIG? Is it against CEO or boar of directors and be paid by insurance company?
	- there will be many lawsuits
- About FDIC insurance for savings for less than 100,000 deposit defined by ownership, if account with a child is it two people one account?
	- again, consult FDIC and local bank
	- if I have personal, family, and company account, that's 3 accounts. Three separate categories ownership
	- if I have 4 personal account in my name like checking or saving account, all of that only being covered up to 100,000. One actor, one category of ownership.
- Just finished master's degree worry about debt accumulation in recession slash depression economy, any thoughts?
	- we don't know the future, we don't know your circumstances, we're not financial advisor but education is always good
- Will Lehman Brothers pensioner get their pension checks?
	- yes but maybe
- Will highest income tax rate to 91% like in 1950s and 60s return?
	- greed exist
	- it can be a problem but also solution
- How federal government stabilize short term in financial market?
	- they could try eliminate volatility and the swings
	- they could say they're going to bail out every institution
	- but at what costs? direct cost taxpayer and indirect in the moral hazard of FMFM
	- for specific, they don't lower interest rate that shows fed don't want to risks causing inflation. That is a strong message, that fed will not going to step in to help as easily.
	- next is, they say they won't bailout Lehman Brothers, but now they had a meeting with AIG, so the message is Lehman is not as big a problem as AIG.
- Bank of America absorb Merrill Lynch, won't it make fewer larger companies that's too big to fail?
	- fewer companies is bad, competition is good, no concentrated power in the market
	- this is the death of investment bank business model.
	- investment bank advise people, structure money into new form and then sell it, they are more speculative thing.
	- they live by borrowing, and if the market loses confidence and there is panic they're gone.
- For single issue voter, what should they look for in a candidate about this economic crisis.
	- independence of a great fed chairman from government influence
	- trade is good, trade helps America
	- unilaterally lower trade barriers
	- focus on smart and stupid regulation not more or less
	- we just learned that investment bank acts like insurance companies for the rest of the economy and maybe need to be less leveraged
	- identify awful stupid rules, maybe mark to market accounting, the need to record market worth that day, that create barrier and destroy initiative. The record also based on nothing.
	- the more you understand economics, the less you can really listen politician.
- US market hold steady, maybe even gaining, where does this based on? Is there a silver lining?
	- overall general pull is upwards. Great Depression is also looks like a blip.
	- there also sectors that doing great, like agriculture, American wine company or auto parts manufacturer.
- Noting economic bubble and the tendencies, tech stock, home value bubble. Has the economy always bubble based? And what's the next sector vulnerable?
	- there is always bubble since there is capitalism.
	- even though two in a close row is odd, but there is argument it's the same bubble.
	- we don't know next bubble is. 
	- by nature, a bubble is irrational exuberance, moment when a lot of people believe the fundamental rules has changed.
	- just hope you don't lose money in it.
- How does peak oil apocalypse fit into financial collapse? 
	- peak oil is a theory when we reach maximum amount of oil and from there, just less and less oil and the price goes up and up before mass adoption of cheap energy and the whole system will collapse.
	- it's possible that energy might get more expensive. 
	- when we don't understand something, our mind goes to worst case scenario.
	- Any new technologies, like CDO and mortgage backed securities, these take a while to figure out. We are in early stages of financial tool.
	- hopefully next time we're more intelligently using these tool.

**(Adam Davidson):**
It is Financial Crisis Day 3. This is the Planet Money Podcast. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm here with Laura Conaway. Hello. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
How are you doing? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
We are trying this experiment which we tried yesterday and we liked it. Answering your questions. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Or do you guys have questions?

**(Adam Davidson):**
We have a lot of questions. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah. So what's happening right now as we speak is that I think AIG is out there trying to get a deal to stay alive. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Right. With this fast-moving story, we should say it's six minutes until four on September 16th. 

Lehman Brothers seems like it might at least have a small rescue package from Barclays Bank. AIG, the giant insurer, was supposed to be saved by a consortium of banks. It looks like that has fallen apart. We're waiting to find out if the federal government's going to step in or what's going to happen there. 

People are very nervous. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Our first question, straight from the apocalypse, from Ari. My retirement money is with Solomon Smith Barney. How much should I worry? Should I take the hit and take out the money and keep it under my mattress or buy gold and keep it in a safe? Seriously, are these legitimate concerns? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
These are certainly legitimate concerns. It would be a huge mistake in my personal view to sell now. I should say I'm not in a position to give financial advice. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
No, you certainly are not. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Consult your personal financial advisor. 

But it is a classic sucker's move to panic sell during a crisis. If you own stocks, if you own a mutual fund, you should own those for the long term. 

And overall, over time, stocks go up. We have every reason to think stocks will go up again. You shouldn't be even looking at it. I don't even look at my 401k statement during times like this. I'll look at it sometime around Christmas. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
If you lost your money in Fannie and Freddie, forget it. You already lost your money. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Oh, yeah. If you own Lehman stock, if you own Fannie and Freddie stock, if you own Merrill Lynch stock, I mean, that's baked in. That's done. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
You don't need to look. You don't need to look. There's nothing to hide under your mattress. We have a special guest, Mike Pascoe, who's over here acting like he's about to strangle. Yes. 

**(Mike Pascoe):**
No, I just wanted to. I love the yesterday's podcast. I just wanted to serve the function of if there's something that confused me, I want to jump in. Let's say you really did want to own gold. 

Does that mean to literally buy literal gold? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Well, now it's much easier. It's much easier now. They have something called an exchange traded fund where you can just on your computer using Ameritrade or E-Trade. We're not endorsing any of those, but using some very easily. You can buy and sell gold all day to your heart's content. 

I don't recommend it, but it's very easy to do without ever physically owning gold. You're owning a paper certificate that's worth its weight in gold. That's it. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
All right. Next question. C. Burke wants to know, what about potential class action suits by shareholders of Fannie, Freddie, Lehman, Merrill, AIG? 

His understanding, her understanding is a lawsuit against the CEO or board of directors would be paid by an insurance company. Is this true? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
There are going to be so many lawsuits, so many shareholder lawsuits, so many investor lawsuits. It will blow your mind. I mean, literally, this is Google securities lawsuit or investor lawsuit. You will find so many. 

This is going to be a multi-billion dollar business. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Next question. Patricia, I think she's talking about your talk today on Talk of the Nation. I'm not sure, but she's asking a question about FDI insurance for savings. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
FDIC. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
FDIC, excuse me. If your deposit in any one bank is less than 100,000, you're okay. Is one account defined by the ownership of the account or by the account itself? In other words, if you have an account with a child, is that two people, one account? What is that? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
I got this email earlier and I looked it up. I posted a link, so it's on npr.org slash money to the FDIC website with the relevant information, but I'll quickly summarize. As I understand it, I'm not a lawyer. Consult the FDIC. Consult your local bank. 

But my understanding is this. If I have an account in my name at a bank and my wife and I have an account in our name at the same bank and I also as a company, I have my own company that's incorporated, I have that account at the bank. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Three accounts. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Three accounts. 

Each one of those is covered up to $100,000 because there are three separate categories of ownership. But if I myself have four accounts that's just in my name that add up to $120,000, only the first 100,000 are covered. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
You're one actor. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
When you're one actor, one category of ownership. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
alright

**(Mike Pascoe):**
So a checkings and a savings account. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah, if I have a checking account, a savings account.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
They don't each get $100,000 of insurance. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
My checking account alone would expose me to risk then. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
You have over $100,000 in checking. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Oh yeah, and you should see my secondary in tertiary. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wow. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
That's right. You're working for me. I'm kidding. 

All right. Emily is 32 and working in nonprofit administration. She recently concluded that a master's degree would really increase my career opportunities and earning power. 

However, I'm worried I will accumulate a significant amount more debt only to find myself in a recession slash depression economy. Any thoughts?

**(Adam Davidson):**
I think overall education is always good. It dramatically increases your long term earning potential. We don't predict the future here. We don't believe anyone who says they can. So we don't know how long there's going to be a recession. 

But you know, they generally don't last that long. The long term, the most pessimistic economists I talked to say by end of 2009, we should be picking up. 

I can't give you advice because I don't know enough about your circumstances. And even if I did, I'm not a financial advisor or anything, but education is a really good idea.

**(Laura Conaway):**
From Kay, I think this might be a yes or no question. 

My 82 year old dad used to work for EF Hutton as an account executive and he is currently receiving his pension check from Lehman Brothers. Will he keep getting his pension checks?

**(Adam Davidson):**
My gut sense would be yes, but this is something that is ugly about pensions. They can get tied up in bankruptcy proceedings and the like. So that, you know, I would, I would consult a lawyer, I guess, on that one.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Okay, Jim, what do you think of returning the highest income tax rate to 91% as it was back in the 1950s and 60s? 

It seems to me that would remove the temptation to create wildly ruinous investment products like toxic waste.

**(Adam Davidson):**
That seems like a shockingly awful suggestion. 

I would say that that's one of the most destructive things I could possibly imagine. I think it's pretty easy to imagine what would happen if the, I mean, I would say that a lot more has been gained than lost by rich people wanting to become rich. 

I think that, you know, rich people would have a huge incentive either to leave the country altogether or to spend an awful lot of their energy avoiding paying income taxes. Seems like a lousy idea. 

The problem here was not greed. People keep saying the problem was greed. In my view, greed is a fixed entity. Sure, the problem was greed, but the problem's always greed. Greed exists.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
And sometimes the solution is greed.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And sometimes the solution is greed. 

I mean, for me, the beauty of capitalism is that at its best, it harnesses greed towards, you know, the invisible hand, Adam Smith, greater social purpose. So, yeah, I think I can't imagine a worse idea. That's a horrible idea.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Kerry, what can the federal government actually do to stabilize the financial market in the short term? They're pumping tons of money in there for one thing, right?

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah, I mean, the thing is the federal government could do, you know, they could really eliminate the volatility and the swings. 

They could say we are going to bail out every institution that does poorly. We are going to guarantee a fixed bottom to stock prices. We are going to guarantee all of this stuff. The problem is what's the cost? 

The issue isn't can the federal government do it. It's what happens if the federal government does it.

First of all, there's a direct cost. We taxpayers have to pay that bill. And if it's not us paying the bill, it's our children and grandchildren paying the bill through debt. So that's a direct cost. 

But there's an indirect cost. Capitalism works best when you take risks and you win if it succeeds and you lose if it fails. If the federal government made the precedent that, well, if things get rocky enough, we're going to come in and rescue everybody and we're going to make everything OK, then people would take bigger risks. They'd worry less about the downside to their actions. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
So a more moderate response. What are they doing to stabilize the market right now? Give me two, if you could, small specific things. Nothing is small here, but two discrete things the federal government has done in the last couple of days. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Well, one thing is something they didn't do today. They did not lower the interest rate. 

So we thought that or some people thought there was a good chance the Fed would lower the interest rate today. What that would do is effectively add more money to the economy, which would mean that banks and then other customers would feel like, oh, there's more money out there. We can borrow more for less money. We'll grow more. 

But the Fed clearly thought that has a risk of causing inflation and also sending a signal that we're always going to be there to help you out when things get bad. 

So not doing that today was a very powerful and strong message that the Fed is not going to step in every time things get ugly and make things a little calmer, a little easier. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
OK, that's one. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
That's one. 

The second thing they did was, well, this is a contradictory thing. On Sunday, they said we aren't. Another thing they didn't do is they said we're not bailing out Lehman Brothers, which was supposed to send a strong signal. The federal government is no longer going to bail out big, troubled financial institutions. 

The problem is even as we speak, they're meeting with A.I.G. and they might bail them out. So I don't know how strong that message is. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
If they did that, presumably they would do that because they would think that a failure of A.I.G. would be a large hit to the system in a way that the failure of Lehman Brothers would not be. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yes, that's right. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Dan wants to know about mergers and acquisitions. Bank of America soaking up Merrill Lynch said, won't there just be fewer larger companies that are, quote, too big to fail? 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yes. As a general rule, having fewer bigger companies is not great. 

It's nice to have competition. It's nice to have, you know, you don't want power concentrated in a few small companies as a general rule. What we may be witnessing, and this is all through the financial press, is the death of the investment bank business model. Since the Great Depression, there's been two different business models for banks. One is a regular bank, 

**(Laura Conaway):**
the savings bank, 

**(Adam Davidson):**
savings bank. It's the Bailey Savings Bank, like from It's Wonderful Life. I take your deposit. I lend it to Mike. End of story. 

The investment bank model is much more is much different. Investment banks don't actually tech. I mean, at the core, it's not that they own things. They advise others. They structure money into new forms and sell it to other people. It's a more speculative thing. 

The core thing, though, is that investment banks borrow money short term. They borrow money every day, billions of dollars a day and lend it out long term. They do that because you can borrow money cheaply overnight and lend it out for more over the long term. 

So investment banks, they can't survive a bad afternoon. They are every day they have to re-borrow all of their money. And if the market loses confidence in them, even for just a few hours, even for a panic, yeah, boom. 

Whereas an actual commercial savings bank, they actually own something. They actually have wealth. So they are more rugged. 

So there's a theory and we'll see there are only two investment banks left. On Friday of last week, there were four. A year ago, there were five. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
That's amazing. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Big investment banks. There are other smaller investment banks. 

**(Mike Pascoe):**
So let's say that yesterday or two days ago, I became a single issue voter in a presidential election. And I want one of the candidates, I would vote for either one who says the right thing about how to handle this economic crisis. 

What sorts of things would you look for one of these two candidates to say? Or maybe the answer is actually it's just the Fed should keep doing what it's doing.

**(Adam Davidson):**
If I could imagine my dream candidate's speech, it would be first of all, as president, there's not a whole lot I can do.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
That would lose you so many votes.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yes. 

But of the things I can do, here's what I will do. I will appoint a really great Fed chairman and let the Fed do its job. I'm not going to tell him what to do. I'm going to let him be politically independent. 

I don't know if I'm going to raise taxes or cut spending, but I'm going to do something to make sure that we spend less money than we get.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
No budget deficits. You want a candidate who emphasizes that?

**(Adam Davidson):**
No, I'm okay with budget deficits, but less of a budget deficit.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
ok

**(Adam Davidson):**
So, okay, I'm going to just tell everyone that trade is good. 

Trade helps America. And the more trade, the better for America. There's going to be some people who are hurt in the short run, but even they are going to benefit in the long run. 

Trade is good. Trust me on this. I'm going to unilaterally lower trade barriers. 

I'm trying to think what else I wouldn't want. 

I've already eliminated even the remote responsibility of my candidate winning.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
You've lost almost every voter except the Columbia and Harvard business school guy. 

But what about regulation? What do you want them to say about regulation?

**(Adam Davidson):**
I'm going to have them say more or less is not the way to talk about regulation. Smart and stupid is the way to talk about regulation.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
Well, the people who want less always say that, right?

**(Adam Davidson):**
I guess, yeah. 

But more isn't good either. I mean, I think smart regulation is the way to go. 

I could get into some of the things that I think of, although, you know, I'm not saying I'm the last word in this. I mean, I think that the parts of our economy that act like insurance companies, like, you know, we're suddenly learning that investment banks kind of act like insurance companies for the rest of the economy, that maybe they shouldn't be quite as leveraged as they were. Maybe there should be a change there. 

I think that there are an awful lot of kind of arbitrary and stupid rules, like this mark to market accounting, where every financial institution every day has to put a number on exactly how much it's worth that day. Even if there's no it, it creates a barrier to acting and it destroys companies and destroys initiative.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
And from what I understand, some of those numbers are so just based on nothing.

**(Adam Davidson):**
They're based on air. Yeah. 

I hear populist rhetoric like let's tax the oil companies and let's end Wall Street greed.

That just doesn't seem serious to me. It doesn't seem helpful. It seems really silly. I mean, obviously I was referring to Barack Obama just now, but John McCain, you know, his comments, I don't find helpful either. I mean, when he says the fundamentals of our economy are strong. The day that two of four investment banks disappear. I mean, I get what he was saying and I was saying because the people is the people are strong and the core system.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
So I guess you could excuse it by, oh, it's actually just a platitude.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Right. Exactly. It's either a platitude or ignorance.

I think in the middle of the worst days of the subprime crisis, when he said what this needs more than anything is less regulation. I mean, he actually just said less.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
Yeah.

**(Adam Davidson):**
I don't think that's necessarily what we need.

So, yeah, I mean, I think when you the more you understand economics, in my view, the less you can really listen to any politician, which is why like someone like Paul Krugman or Brad DeLong on the left and any number of people on the right. I just don't see how they get into candidates. I just I honestly don't understand it. How do you how do you get into liking a candidate?

**(Laura Conaway):**
Rose says she's noticed that the markets, at least in the U.S., are holding relatively steady, maybe even gaining. What, quote, good news is this based on? Is there a silver lining or happy ending somewhere that I'm not aware of?

**(Adam Davidson):**
You know, markets, the general pull is upwards. You know, if you look over the at a at a graph over the last 100 years or whatever, I mean, you see down bits and then it goes up again. I mean, even the Great Depression, if you look at the graph, looks like a blip. And we assume that we're in a blip period.

So overall, the silver lining is we, I, most people who run the economy, which is not I, obviously, but, you know, have confidence in the long term viability of the system.

Also, there are sectors that are doing great. This is a fabulous time to be in agriculture. It's a fabulous time to be exporting things to the rest of the world. The dollar is cheap. You're selling a lot. 

So, you know, it's not a great time to be a financial company. It's a wonderful time to be an American wine company. It's a wonderful time to be an American auto parts manufacturer, much better than it was a few years ago.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Which brings us to Chris, who is noting economic bubbles and the tendency of the economy to have them. Tech stock bubble, home value bubble, he says. Has the economy always been so bubble based? And what's the next sector vulnerable to this sort of thing?

**(Adam Davidson):**
There have been bubbles since the dawn of capitalism. There have been bubbles for a long time. There are many, many bubbles over the years. 

It does seem a little quick, a little odd to have two big bubbles right in a row. There is an argument that they're actually the same bubble, kind of. It's complicated.

We don't know what the next bubble is. There's a theory that it's, you know, green technology. You know, by its very nature, a bubble is a time of irrational exuberance, a time when people believe that the world has fundamentally changed and the old rules no longer apply. So where will that happen next?

I don't know. I just hope I don't lose money in it, I guess.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So we've saved a haymaker for you right here at the end from RR. 

How does peak oil apocalypse fit into our financial collapse? How far offer we from a long emergency or world made by hand type collapse?

**(Adam Davidson):**
That doesn't feel on the table in any way, shape or form. 

Peak oil, for those who don't know, is a theory very popular on the internet. Search peak oil. You'll see lots of stuff on it that basically we are not going to find. We've used, how do I say this? 

We have reached the maximum amount of oil and from here on out, it's just less and less oil.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Ski slope going down.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah, and the price goes up and up and we aren't going to be able to have cheap energy and the whole system will collapse. 

There have been many, many times in the last couple hundred years that we have been told we have reached the end of our system for one reason or another. 

I don't buy it. I think that yes, energy might be more expensive. It's possible, although it's worth noting that oil prices are now below 100. You know, there's a time when $92 barrel oil would not be seen as a good thing. But you know, it is these days. 

There's a lot of really smart minds working on cheaper energy. I just I think people's minds when they don't understand something is to go to the absolute worst possible scenario. 

I don't think I think we're fine. I think a year from now, two years from now, three years from now, you know, a recession or a downturn. It always feels this bad. And then, you know, three years from now, I'm not going to be able to get on the radio. People aren't going to listen to the podcast as much because they're not going to care about economics because they're too busy doing their job and spending their money. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
i'm ringing the bell. That's it.

**(Mike Pascoe):**
Would you say we've hit peak podcast then?

**(Adam Davidson):**
Not yet.

**(Laura Conaway):**
You've got 31 seconds.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Mike, any questions?

**(Mike Pascoe):**
I would just like to point out that too many bubbles together equals foam.

**(Adam Davidson):**
We are in a foamy period. That is actually a language that people use. 

This is a frothy frothy is another word that people use for the radical volatility. 

Let me just quickly, I will end on this. We are something like 20 years into a new financial system. Starting in the 80s, really hitting its stride in the 90s and taking a leap forward in this decade is a new financial system of credit derivatives and complicated financial instruments. All this stuff you might hear about CDSs and CDOs and mortgage backed securities. Well, mortgage backed securities are a little older, but collateralized debt obligations and some other things. 

These are new things. We haven't figured them out yet. Any new technology, the printing press, paper money, metal money, democracy, I mean these take a while to figure out. We're in the early stages of this financial tool. 

I think the smart people who I trust and have convinced me that these tools are good tools. They were used very poorly and this is the first major hiccup. This is very standard. You try something out, you screw it up real badly, and then you think, boy, I got to use it a little more intelligently next time. 

Hopefully, hopefully that's what is happening now.

**(Laura Conaway):**
So we're at npr.org slash money.

**(Adam Davidson):**
npr.org slash money and we are eager for your questions either there or at planet money at npr.org.
