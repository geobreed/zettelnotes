An interview with Scott Talbott a lobbyist from the financial industry. 

Their position is support the White House Bill for the Treasury to buy the toxic assets and save the financial industry. Take some partial culpability with the actions of Community Reinvestment Act that require them to make aggressive lending to low and moderate income. But the incentive is for the bank is to not see the consequences and eventually set the risk too low of a price. 

The argument that 2008 financial crisis have [[The Prime Mover]] is not persuasive. There is a lot of regulations that was conceived by good intention and was considered smart ended up become a mistake when paired with bad incentives.

Financial industry does see that they are seen by the public that they will get [[The Golden Parachute]]

# Points

- September 22nd, 11:12 am
- an interview with Scott Talbott a lobbyist of the financial industry, Financial Service Roundtable, encompassing banks, financial institutions, insurance companies
	- what's at stake for financial industry this week, what they want and don't want?
		- this is a huge bill that affects housing sector, U.S. economy, major players, taxpayer and homeowner
		- Congress and Treasury shoring up the economy, the housing market and from Main Street will trickle down to taxpayers
	- so you support the White House Bill?
		- we support it, the market need help right now
		- Treasury put it out but it's the administration proposal
		- we support Congress' fast move on
			- broad authority from Congress to Treasury
			- flexibility for Treasury to utilize its program, $700 billion program
				- to purchase illiquid assets from financial institution
				- to help recapitalization
				- to reopen normal operation including consumer lending, mortgage, cc, auto loans, student loans
				- restart housing market simultaneously saving Wall Street and Main Street
	- when public hear the Treasury bring $700 billion to buy bad assets, what they hear is giving money to a bunch of people who already made a profit off of them and cause this whole mess in the first place, how do you deal with that?
		- there is a couple of issues here, if we analyze the root of all this, the subprime lending market
			- there is a requirement under Community Reinvestment Act, to aggressively lend to neighborhoods and outreach loans, especially low and moderate-income neighborhoods
			- there's a large degree of culpability in the industry
				- real estate brokers to mortgage brokers to financial institutions
				- no one stopped
	- to this pin this event on a prime movers or a single event is an argument that not particularly persuasive. There was lax lending standards. A complete collapse of prudent lending practices and risk was priced too cheaply. So what pushed your group to accept the consequences of their bad decisions. In normal times capitalism would welcome disappearance of institution that taken risk and doesn't pay off
		- this is an intersection of politics and policy and the capitalism magic is shown on Lehman, although only Lehman currently
		- but there is also a number of CEOs terminated etc
		- but also we enter unusual area with the concept of too big to fail with AIG
			- not because AIG made bad mistakes
			- but AIG insures the shipping world, barbershops, bakeries
			- the downstream effect on those institution will erase their insurance and they can't operate
			- this effect justifies the Treasury stepping in
	- this seems good for your membership, to not pay the price for the risks they took
		- disagree, look at DOD
			- they already have huge losses and decrease in share value which hurts companies and shareholder
			- the government taking priority ownership, through debt or equity position in companies
			- there is a provision to limit executive comp, the executives, for those company that participate in the program
	- for our listeners, they see that those guys are walking scot-free and you're saying they lost major. But they're not bearing the full consequences of their decision, maybe you're saying that the system can't be saved without preventing those people from feeling the full consequences for both institution and executives
		- from executives standpoints, they will feel the pain if this compensation provision remains
		- but we opposed that essentially the government setting the price control for executive compensation
		- essentially it says, secretary shall require limits on compensation to include incentives for executives  to take risks that the Treasury secretary deems inappropriate or excessive

With Congress determined to pass a $700 billion bailout bill for Wall Street this week, bank lobbyist Scott Talbott gives us his view of the action. He wants the economy back on his feet — but he wants no limit on pay for the boss.

Listen Up: What A Bank Lobbyist Wants Right Now

Just press play.

Scott Talbott, chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, will spend this week trying to get the best possible deal for his clients — the bankers and investors whose miserable balance sheets almost brought down the global economy last week.

Now those bankers stand to get a bailout from the federal government. Congress and the U.S. Treasury are working out a bill that would allow the Treasury secretary to buy up $700 billion in bad debts.

Talbott says the banking industry does bear some responsibility for things going so wrong, though not sole responsibility. Among his concerns this week: erasing a proposed provision to limit executive pay.

Update: Congress says White House agrees to limit executive pay.

SCOTT TALBOTT: 
This is a hyperdrive, blitzkrieg, no huddle of lobbying. This is the Super Bowl and New Year's Eve all rolled into one. This is watershed. This is historic. This is extraordinary.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:
And you are listening to the PLANET MONEY podcast. I'm Adam Davidson. This is our continued crisis week coverage. This is Week 2, I guess we could say - Week 3, depending on how you're counting. It is Monday, September 22. We give the time here. It's - because things change so fast. It's 11:12 in the morning. The Chris Dodd bill literally just was released. We know that congressional Democrats and the White House are in fierce negotiations. And we thought it would be very helpful to talk to Scott Talbott. Scott is - I guess you could call him the leading lobbyist for the financial industry. He - is that fair, Scott?

TALBOTT: 
Well, I'm one of them. Yes.

DAVIDSON: 
OK. He runs lobbying for the Financial Services Roundtable. They represent, basically, the hundred largest companies that care about what's happening this week - banks, financial institutions, insurance companies. And, Scott, you - how does this week compare to any other week in your life?

TALBOTT: 
This is like no other. This is an amazing week. I - over the weekend, I received 600 emails, was on no less than five conference calls and had countless number of individual phone calls. And that was just the weekend. Rolling into this week, it will be more of the same but on steroids. The day started for me around 6:30 and won't end tonight until about 11:30 or 12, and then we'll get up tomorrow and do it all over again.

DAVIDSON: 
Was I the first guy to talk to you this morning?

TALBOTT: 
Yes, you are.

DAVIDSON: 
All right.

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:
Go, Adam. Go.

(LAUGHTER)

TALBOTT: 
Adam, you get the star.

DAVIDSON: 
OK. And I should say, we're here with Laura Conaway. So let's do the top line. What's at stake for the financial industry this week? What are they paying you to make sure it does happen? And what are they paying you to make sure it does not happen?

TALBOTT: 
Sure. This is a huge bill. And the housing sector and subsequently the U.S. economy, as well as the major players and the taxpayers, as well as homeowners, are at risk. And the Treasury, along with the Congress, are taking huge steps - this is enormous; I can't overstress the enormity of this act - are taking this huge step to shore up the housing market, to shore up the economy, to shore up individual players in the financial services industry, everybody from Main Street. And all of the effects of these will trickle down to Main Street and to the taxpayers.

DAVIDSON: 
I'm getting the sense you support the White House bill.

TALBOTT: 
We support the White House proposal. It's actually - Treasury put it out, but it's the administration's proposal. We support Congress' efforts to move quickly. They want it - we want to get it done this week. The markets need the help right now. We support having broad authority from Congress to the Treasury, which we see in the draft Dodd bill that I have in front of me. We support flexibility for the Treasury Department to utilize its program, which is a $700 billion program, to purchase illiquid assets from distressed financial institutions to help free up capital and cash flow to allow those institutions to regain operations as normal, which includes lending to consumers - both mortgage, credit card, auto loans, student loans, the whole bit. This program will help restart the housing market and the economy and at the same time save Wall Street and Main Street.

CONAWAY: 
Scott, can I just jump in...

TALBOTT: 
Sure.

CONAWAY: 
...For the average listener or commentor coming in. I'm just going to represent their side for...

TALBOTT: 
Sure.

CONAWAY: 
...Just a second. What they hear when you talk about the Treasury coming in and spending 700 billion or 1 trillion or whatever it's going to be...

TALBOTT: 
Seven hundred billion.

CONAWAY: 
...To buy up these bad assets, what they say is, $700 billion to a bunch of people who made a - you know, a gabillion (ph) dollars already off my back.

TALBOTT: 
Right.

CONAWAY: 
I know you've heard that.

DAVIDSON: 
And who caused...

CONAWAY: 
Caused the mess in the first place.

DAVIDSON: 
...The crisis through their faulty risk management.

CONAWAY: 
Yeah.

TALBOTT: 
Sure.

CONAWAY: 
How do you deal with that?

TALBOTT: 
Sure. Sure. Well, there's a couple of issues here. If you look at the subprime lending market, which is really the root of all of this, we've got sort of two issues. One, there is a requirement that financial institutions, under - it's called the Community Reinvestment Act - aggressively lend to neighborhoods and outreach loans. So there's sort of a, you know, well, we were asked to do it. We're required to do it. At the same time, there's a large degree of culpability in the industry, ranging from real estate brokers to mortgage brokers to financial institutions to those...

DAVIDSON: 
Including your members. They do...

TALBOTT: 
Including my members, absolutely.

DAVIDSON: 
They bear a fair amount of the responsibility.

CONAWAY: 
And they're saying, we bear some responsibility here.

TALBOTT: 
Sure. The answer is, we started with the requirement that we lend - that institutions lend to neighborhoods, especially low and moderate-income neighborhoods. And then there was some degree of culpability from the mortgage broker to the bank, to the securitization, to the investor - all along the line. No one stopped and said, hey, the emperor has no clothes.

DAVIDSON: 
I got to say, Scott, I'm not a big believer in prime movers and single events that set things into motion. I'm particularly - I just got to say, just put my cards on the table. I'm particularly unpersuaded by the argument that this is all a result of the government saying you got to lend to poor people.

TALBOTT: 
Oh, no, no, no.

DAVIDSON: 
There was tremendously lax lending standards. There's a complete collapse of prudent lending practices, and risk was simply priced far too cheaply. So what...

TALBOTT: 
(Inaudible).

DAVIDSON: 
...Happens this week that pushes your membership to - I don't know if the word is be punished but to accept the consequences of their bad decisions. In normal times, I think, anyone who believes in capitalism - and I'm certainly someone who believes in capitalism - would welcome the idea that major institutions disappear when they take risks the size and scope that they took that didn't pay off. That's a good thing. I think most of your members agree with that idea, right?

TALBOTT: 
Sure, sure. Yeah, this is an interesting intersection of politics and policy. In general, the market - if we believe the market forces should work their magic - and we saw that with Lehman, and we saw that - well, especially with Lehman. And however you...

DAVIDSON: 
I know. It's hard to think of anywhere else where the markets have worked their magic lately.

TALBOTT: 
Well, there've been - you know, there've been a number of CEOs have been terminated, etc., etc. But now we've crossed into - and you make a good point, Adam - we've crossed into an unusual area where the concept of too big to fail, the entire country is in trouble. And we're beginning to see where the government says, you know what, if AIG - we cannot allow AIG to fail, not because AIG made bad mistakes but because AIG insures the shipping world, the barbershops, the bakeries. And if AIG insurance is gone, then all of those the down - the domino effect, the downstream effect on those institutions will be they will not have insurance and therefore cannot operate. And the catastrophic effects on the economy in general justify the Treasury stepping in. This is historic and unprecedented.

DAVIDSON: 
This seems like a great week for your membership. I don't see how they end up, as a result of this action, paying the price for the risks they took.

TALBOTT: 
Oh, I disagree - looking at the DOD, a couple of things. One, they are - already have huge losses and huge decreases in share value, which hurts not just the companies but the shareholders as well, you know, the investing public, pension funds, etc., etc. Looking - turning to the DOD bill specifically, they are talking about the government taking ownership, priority ownership, either through debt or equity positions in the companies. So now, you have the government as an owner of your company. Secondly, there is a provision in here to limit executive comp for those company - the executives of those companies that participate in the program, which hits - you know, that goes all the way right up to the top.

DAVIDSON: 
I don't like class warfare. I'm not into that. But I think they're - I feel the anger. I feel the frustration that our listeners let us know, that family members and friends of mine have let me know about. Those guys are walking off scot-free. And you're saying, no, not scot-free. They've lost major - you know, they've lost stock options. They've lost a lot of things. But they're not - they are not bearing the full weight, the full consequences of their decisions. And it - maybe what you're saying is it's just there is no way. You can't save the system without preventing those people from feeling the full consequences. Is that...

TALBOTT: 
Well, I mean, are you referring to institutions or are you referring to executives?

DAVIDSON: 
I guess both.

TALBOTT: 
Yeah. I think from the executive standpoint, if this compensation provision remains in, they will certainly feel the pain there. As far as the financial institutions...

DAVIDSON: 
Now, I should say, you are working hard to get rid of that compensation provision.

TALBOTT: 
We're opposed to that. I mean, that essentially is the government setting the price controls for executive compensation.

DAVIDSON: 
And what we're talking about is - is it Senator Dodd? I know that Barney Frank in the House wants to say that any institution that gets part of this government bailout, their executives can only make a certain amount of money. They can't get golden parachutes where they get millions and millions of dollars when a company collapses or - right? That - is that a - have I described that right?

TALBOTT: 
Yeah, yeah. Essentially, here's the language. It says, secretary shall require limits on compensation to include incentives for executives to take risks that the Treasury secretary deems inappropriate or excessive.

DAVIDSON: 
Now, can I just...

CONAWAY: 
And you want that out?

TALBOTT: 
Yes.

DAVIDSON: 
Scott, thank you so much. That was Scott Talbott, the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. Scott, you - you know, I feel like we had a frank exchange there. I appreciate your doing that. I hope we can talk with you as this as this unfolds both this week and over the next year.

TALBOTT: 
Sure.
