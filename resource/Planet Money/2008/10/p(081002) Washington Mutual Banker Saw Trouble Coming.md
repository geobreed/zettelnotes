MARCY KAPTUR: Now, you're very anxious. I can hear your voice there. For the sake of the country and...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Right.

KAPTUR: ...Even the sake of the markets, I think you should operate prudently and with a little bit of calm in your voice today.

(SOUNDBITE OF JEFF TWEEDY SONG, "SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE")

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

Hi, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY podcast. Today is Thursday, October 2. I'm Laura Conaway. It's about 5:22 p.m. here in New York. We just heard the soothing words of Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio. She was talking to a TV reporter this week. And so we all calmed down.

News of the financial crisis helped. It kind of hit a natural pause today. The Senate voted for the $700 billion bailout bill last night. We're expecting a vote in the House of Representatives on Friday. Meanwhile, we got an email from a listener named Cody (ph) today. Cody writes, everyone everywhere in every form of media seems to be saying the same thing. We need to do something about this economic crisis. But what if we don't? What would be the long-term picture of inaction? Well, Cody, I'm about to play a very, very rich interview with someone who has an answer - his own answer - to your question.

His name is William Longbrake. He served as chief financial officer for Washington Mutual from 1982 through 2002. Longbrake stayed with the bank all those years after - until it collapsed and failed last month. He sat down and talked with Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg. They're reporting a couple of major stories. The first is for All Things Considered on Friday. The second is for a special edition of This American Life this weekend. Their interview with William Longbrake was kind of a breakthrough.

ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE: From a position inside the bank, as you know, as a former CFO and somebody who was probably paying attention, what was the first thing that sort of caused you discomfort? Was there an initial sign? Was there something that was going wrong right away that you saw?

WILLIAM LONGBRAKE: Oh, absolutely. There was something that disturbed me deeply. And it actually was a long time ago. It was probably about 2003, and that's when home prices began to rise at a rate that was much faster than people's incomes were rising. In the long run, if the value of houses is going up faster than incomes, it begins over time, as that gap grows, to create an affordability problem for a lot of buyers. In other words, home prices simply get out of their reach.

And what - and that's exactly what happened in our economy, you know, is that housing prices felt good when they were going up. Everybody was giddy with all the wealth that they were accumulating. And they - a lot of them spent it and so forth. But the problem was that all the time, as housing prices were getting higher and higher and higher, the affordability was declining. And eventually, the ability of a lot of people to buy homes just disappeared. And we had too many houses.

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: Now, would you go into a meeting at Washington Mutual and say, hey, guys, I'm feeling a little weird about this? Home prices are...

LONGBRAKE: (Laughter).

BLUMBERG: You're laughing.

LONGBRAKE: Oh, I absolutely did that.

BLUMBERG: And what did they say?

LONGBRAKE: I'm laughing because you're asking that question. I said 2003. I did that. And yet the bank failed. So you might say, well, OK, why did that happen?

BLUMBERG: They didn't listen to you.

LONGBRAKE: Well, that would be one answer.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: So who - let me imagine. Let me imagine I'm the CEO of Washington Mutual. Bill Longbrake sends me an email. He gives me a call and says, hey, home prices are going up really fast. It makes me nervous. I think there's risk here we're not aware of. And I say, huh, let me call - well, let me call down to the mortgage department. Hey, guys, what's going on? We're making more money than we've ever made in our lives, and we think we will continue to make more money than we've ever made in our lives for a long time. And the CEO goes, well, I could listen to Bill and make - and not make more money than I've ever made in my life. Or I can listen to the mortgage sales guys and ignore Bill and make more money. It seems like an easy choice.

LONGBRAKE: Well, and - unfortunately, it was. And then, it was more than just the mortgage guys. It was all of Wall Street. It was all of the investors saying, hey, this is great. You're making good profits. There's opportunity. Just go for broke. Go for it.

DAVIDSON: You saw signs of trouble in 2002, 2003. People stopped paying back their loans. Basically, that's where it first shows up, sort of (inaudible) early?

LONGBRAKE: Well, that's actually exactly right, is that the delinquencies on loans actually began to build during 2006 two years ago. And...

DAVIDSON: So all of a sudden, you're loaning money to people, and - whereas before they'd paid it back, now they couldn't pay it back.

LONGBRAKE: Well, not everybody, but, you know...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

LONGBRAKE: ...Enough that were not paying it back that it became very obvious.

BLUMBERG: And can I just ask the - I think this is obvious also. But - so Washington Mutual was doing this, as were lots of other banks, doing the stated income...

LONGBRAKE: Yes.

BLUMBERG: ...Even the no-income, no-asset loans, the ninja loans as they're called, you know?

LONGBRAKE: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: And that's where you start seeing the actual numbers. You're seeing...

DAVIDSON: You're a CFO, and you're looking at your balance sheet, and you're like, this - now delinquencies are rising. We've loaned this money out. It's not coming back at 7%. It's coming back at 6% or 5% because people are defaulting. And then, we can't resell the houses now because there's - the market has started to decline. And so if we buy a house that - if we - if the person bought a house at, you know, 700,000, we can only sell it now at 600,000, so now we're taking a loss, right?

LONGBRAKE: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: Right.

LONGBRAKE: When the losses began to accumulate - and that's from the delinquencies that you mentioned a moment ago - and then the sales of homes at depressed prices or reduced prices, the losses began to occur. Then, what many companies did is they went out to find new sources of stock. In the case of Washington Mutual, it went out in April of this year and to a group of private investors and raised $7.2 billion in new stock. And that was intended to cover losses and actually help the bank bridge the gap in time to absorb the losses that were coming off of the loan portfolio. Unfortunately, that didn't work, but oftentimes it does. Oftentimes, getting an additional capital is a way to make up for the losses that are now coming in and help the institutions survive. And many would have done that. And some, like Washington Mutual, it wasn't enough. Others will survive.

BLUMBERG: As somebody - I feel like sometimes out in the public, there's the sense that, like, it's a huge multinational. In this case, it wasn't multinational. But it's a huge, $300 billion corporation. And, you know, it - was there - how did it feel to be watching it go down? Was it, like - was there an emotional component for you? Were you actually sad, did you actually sort of feel depression about it?

LONGBRAKE: Well, let me give you an analogy. So Washington Mutual failed last Thursday. My sister-in-law died on Tuesday. And she died of cancer. We had known that she had a very aggressive cancer for two years. And we knew that survival was unlikely. And as the time of her death approached, it became more and more apparent that it was imminent. So we all go through the grieving process and - with loved ones. And particularly, when we have time to absorb what's happening, we have. You know, it doesn't make it any less painful when the actual event occurs. But we do have the opportunity to understand and go through that grieving process and cope with it. And the same thing was true with Washington Mutual. It wasn't like one day it was a great company and the next day it was put into receivership by the FDIC. No, it progressed over a very long period of time. And so, yes, there were emotional moments for me, unhappy moments, angry moments. That's what you do through - go through the grieving process. But I had long since prior to last week come to accept the likely outcome.

BLUMBERG: But it wasn't...

LONGBRAKE: Does that makes sense to you?

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. But - and the thing that strikes me is that the very fact that you would compare it to the loss of a loved one means that there was actual - there was grief.

LONGBRAKE: Yeah. Absolutely. Definitely, there was grief on the part of many of the employees in the company. And some were better...

DAVIDSON: And you've devoted...

LONGBRAKE: I was just going to say, some were better prepared for that than others.

DAVIDSON: But, I mean, you have devoted - you said '82, so 26 years..

LONGBRAKE: Twenty-six years.

DAVIDSON: ...Of your life to this place.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. So I understand how this affects a company that was in the mortgage market, you know, like, companies like yours, Washington Mutual, and others that were sort of making a lot of home loans. How does it spread, though? I mean, that's what's being talked about now is that this - that there's, like, it's gone from being a mortgage problem to a system-wide problem. It's spreading. Do you have any sense of, how does that happen? How does somebody, you know, who is making a lot of loans in the mortgage market spread to a bank that wasn't making as many - that wasn't in the mortgage market as much?

LONGBRAKE: Well, it spread in two different ways, so let's take them one at a time.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

LONGBRAKE: First of all, if you go back to the Washington Mutual example, a large amount of the funds that were used to finance those loans that were made came from other institutions. Then, also, a lot of the loans that were made by Washington Mutual were put into securities and sold to investors.

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: And the investors would be pension funds, you know, money market mutual funds - you name it.

BLUMBERG: Other banks?

LONGBRAKE: Other banks. Insurance companies.

BLUMBERG: OK.

LONGBRAKE: Foreign governments.

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: A lot of investors came from abroad. But - so all these people are now holding paper - or securities, I should say, that have losses in them.

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: As the housing prices turn down and delinquencies rise and losses begin to incur, the losses are not just in the bank but amongst a broad set of investors. And then on the other side, the borrowed funds from these investors say, well, if the bank fails, will I get paid off? Because unlike a depositor, who's insured by the FDIC, the company that lends to the bank is not always protected.

BLUMBERG: I see.

LONGBRAKE: And so what happens in a panic? It's like yelling fire in a theater. You want to race for the exit. And it creates - everybody, you know, you don't think, you just go. And that's what's happened here in the last few weeks is you've literally got a panic. It's, don't ask questions, just get your money out.

BLUMBERG: Right. And if - you as an institution, you need people to lend you money. Like, that is the entire business model of a bank. If you can't get people to lend you at two and 3%, you don't have any money to lend out at six or 7%. So you have no way of making money. The lending side is critical, right?

LONGBRAKE: Yeah, absolutely critical. Yes.

BLUMBERG: And so what you're saying is, if there becomes, like, sort of a - if your bank becomes tainted with, like, the fear that we're going to lend you money and you're not - and we're not going to get it back, then all of a sudden, your business model sort of goes down the tubes pretty rapidly? If you can't raise that money, you can't sort of operate, right?

LONGBRAKE: If the bank suddenly has less funds available to lend, then the relationship they have with the small business customer - I'm just trying to give you an example here.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

LONGBRAKE: The small business customer needs to have a draw on their line of credit for, let's say, making a payroll payment or something of that sort...

BLUMBERG: Buying some equipment...

LONGBRAKE: ...And the bank doesn't have the money to give to them.

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: Or personalize it this way - the homeowner has an equity line of credit which they can draw upon to pay for junior's college expenses or for a vacation or home repairs or whatever, you know? Lots of people have home equity lines of credit that they use that way. What the banks have now been doing, since there's less funding available, is they have been arbitrarily reducing the lines of credit. And so suddenly, what people thought they could borrow is not available any longer.

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: So those are real consequences for people and for businesses, particularly small businesses. And it creates uncertainty. It creates anxiety. And at the worst, it actually makes it impossible for them to do - pursue business plans or pursue personal plans that they were intending to do. And that has a consequence for the functioning of the economy.

BLUMBERG: So that's the consequence of, like, a bank going down, a bank like Washington Mutual or whatever going down. And that's a consequence in the real economy. Then the way it sort of spreads to other banks - and let's make sure I understand this. I lent you money. I'm a bank. I lent you money. I'm a company. I lent you money in the form of a bond or something like that. And then I'm - and then if you go down, then I don't - then that's a loss for me, basically, right? And so then I'm - and that starts to cascade. So just like you had losses on your lending side, now they have losses on their lending side. And they're going through the same process that you went through, where you have to, like, borrow money and raise capital. And you - that - people start to worry about you.

LONGBRAKE: Yeah, that's exactly right. Fear takes hold. You don't know who to trust. You don't know who's the next one to fall and cause you a loss, so take no chances. Just get your money out of there and to a safe place. That's why, back on the 19th of September, when, really, this current panic started, the Treasury bill rate that day - yeah, the 13-week Treasury bill rate - went to zero.

BLUMBERG: Right, because people...

LONGBRAKE: Because people just wanted to be in a safe asset even if it had no yield to it.

DAVIDSON: Bill, I feel like I want it to be rational panic. Am I right? Because if it - I mean irrational panic because if it's...

LONGBRAKE: Well...

DAVIDSON: ...Irrational panic, with a little bit of time, everyone will calm down and figure things out. If it's rational, that means we really are as bad off as it seems. With irrational, at least we got a shot at coming out of this OK with some time.

LONGBRAKE: Well, so let me kind of rain on your parade a little bit. It is irrational panic at the moment, and that's what the Congress and the president and the secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve are all trying to deal with, is to take the panic out of the current situation by passing a piece of legislation. But there is a more fundamental issue. And so just passing a piece of legislation and taking away the irrational panic is not going to suddenly mean that the economy is going to do marvelous and recover. You're still going to have losses that the system has to absorb, and until that's completed, there will continue to be negative pressure on financial institutions and probably negative consequences for the economy as a whole.

DAVIDSON: Right.

LONGBRAKE: I hope that doesn't sound too dark, but that's...

BLUMBERG: It's pretty dark, Bill.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Well, because what you're saying is, like, that, like, it's going to - this process is going to continue sort of no matter what. If housing is at the bottom of all this, then loans are going to continue to deteriorate in value, and you're going to continue to have to raise money.

LONGBRAKE: No. The process we need - you're not going to stop the home price fall. Essentially, the objective has to be to get them back to reasonable levels. And in the process of that occurring is to contain the damage, the collateral damage that's occurring.

BLUMBERG: Right. So to keep - to make sure that, like, if you're - to make sure that the panic doesn't spread, to make sure it doesn't go to...

LONGBRAKE: Right, because the - you know, the panic actually can make things far, far worse than they need to be.

DAVIDSON: So what - let's just say for now, the worst happens. I mean, does it mean, like, I walk around Manhattan and there's a few more stores closed, there's a few more people out of work, but basically my life is the same? Or does it mean, like, I need a lot of canned soup in my basement and bottled water and...

LONGBRAKE: Well, I don't think we're looking for a replay of the 1930s here, but...

DAVIDSON: But people are talking about - I mean, the word Great Depression comes up an awful lot lately.

LONGBRAKE: Well, that - and that's because the kinds of events that are happening in the financial markets right now we have not seen since the 1930s, quite frankly. We've had other financial crises over the last few decades, but nothing quite to compare with the current one. So it's understandable that you would get these kinds of comparison. That doesn't mean that we're headed in that direction.

DAVIDSON: It strikes me that - oh, sorry.

LONGBRAKE: Well, I was just going to say that the student of history, if you go back and study the '30s there were enormous mistakes made on the policy front that did get into that amplification and magnification that we were talking about a moment ago where the panic did ensue and everything. You got up to 25% unemployment in the country.

DAVIDSON: Right.

LONGBRAKE: I don't believe that's going to happen because, again, we have things in place today that we didn't have in those days. We have unemployment benefits, insurance benefits to keep income propped up. We have deposit insurance, which we didn't have back then. And so there are a lot of safety net types of things that will cushion the blow. And I am optimistic ultimately that the Congress and the administration and the Federal Reserve will do things that help cushion the necessary correction so that doesn't evolve into a panic and a depression type of outcome.

DAVIDSON: Now, let me just paint another picture, which I think you're going to tell me is absolutely ridiculous and is not at all possible. So this other picture is a true meltdown of our financial system where there is - I go to the ATM machine. There's no cash there because the bank doesn't have enough cash to put it there because they can't get a line of credit. I go - I want to write a check. But my bank is under FDIC receivership and so is every other bank around. And there's a chaos that has ensued. My employer can't pay me because they can't get the short-term loan to make payroll this month. And I'm starting to, you know, trade my furniture for chickens in order to eat because our monetary - you know, our financial system has broken.

BLUMBERG: And I don't know who has chickens. I don't even know where to go...

DAVIDSON: There is a place near me in Brooklyn that sells live chickens.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: I'm going to go there today and just make sure they have enough. I'm going to get to know them.

BLUMBERG: Honey, don't forget to bring the stuffed chair. Don't forget to bring the rocking chair. We need some chickens today.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. That we become a barter economy, that money ceases to have any meaning - is that on the table?

LONGBRAKE: No. Absolutely not. So you were right. That's utterly ridiculous.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Right. Let me play the other - let me just - my question is the following. I hear people sort of talking about, like, very dire consequences, but then when people lay out the dire consequences, it sounds like a pretty severe recession, which I've lived through, we've all lived through. And - or maybe not even that severe a recession. Maybe, like, you know, late '70s, early '80s, something like that. Now, the, you know, the bailout bill that, as we are talking now, was defeated. It's coming up for a vote again in the Senate tonight. It's $700 billion in public money that's going to go to - sort of by necessity, it's going to go to the same people who made some bad decisions probably, right?

And there is a sense, I think, on behalf of the public - and, you know, part of me shares that sense - that is this, you know, if we believe in the free market, which I think we do, isn't there an argument to be made that won't the market sort of sort itself out? There are banks that are strong. They will take over the banks that are weak. They will start lending. They have to lend. That is the only way a bank makes money. There are people with cash. They have to lend it out. That is the only way they make money. You know, there are companies that are solvent, that are good credit risks, that are, you know, people are going to be happy to lend money to. Isn't there - is there an argument to be made that why should the taxpayer be on the hook for, you know, bailing out companies that didn't make good decisions?

LONGBRAKE: You've raised basically what I would say are two different issues.

BLUMBERG: OK.

LONGBRAKE: One has to do with the bailout, but the other has to do with what is the responsibility of the public authorities now?

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: If you're a true believer in free markets, you could argue - and those true believers do - is the market will correct itself. Well, but at what cost? And the process and what we were discussing earlier was the potential for an ordinary downturn and correction, a necessary correction and purging of excesses to spin out of control and move into panic and perhaps even depression. So there is a role for public authorities, for public policy to manage the correction in a way that it doesn't spin out of control and create needless damage and potentially lead to panic. So...

BLUMBERG: Right.

LONGBRAKE: ...That would be my first point. And that's what the Congress and the administration are attempting to do. And when they say dire consequences if you don't do this, they're referring to we can't promise that the market will self-correct in an orderly fashion. It might be that very bad things happen if we don't intervene. The other point I would make has to do with the - let's come back to the 700 billion because it has billed as a bailout. And it really is not, but it's the fault of the administration for not explaining that properly. What is being proposed is a fund of Treasury money - up to 700 billion - to purchase distressed assets at fair market prices. And if that is done appropriately in terms of the price discovery and buying those assets, then the Treasury will end up with the balance sheet that we talked about earlier, is it will have not 700 billion in face value loans, but 700 billion in loans fair value or what's recoverable value against 700 billion in Treasury securities where we've done the borrowing, so the balance sheet will equal.

It will hold those until the crisis passes. They will collect the principal payments, and eventually whatever's left, they will sell. But there is every chance that at the end of the day, the Treasury will end up even, so there will be no loss whatsoever to the taxpayer. It might even end up with a profit. There's a chance there will be a loss, but it's certainly not anywhere close to 700 billion. So simply to say this is a bailout of Wall Street and it's going to be 700 billion lost to the taxpayers is just - it's not the correct interpretation, but that's - nobody has explained that at all particularly well. And so it's easy for everyone to say, oh, 700 billion, we're bailing out Wall Street. The taxpayers are bearing the burden. That's a bad thing.

CONAWAY: That was William Longbrake, former chief financial officer of Washington Mutual. He talked to Alex Blumberg and Adam Davidson.

And that's the PLANET MONEY podcast for today, Thursday, October 2. We're off to watch the great vice presidential debate. I'm Laura Conaway. Take care.

Now you're very anxious I can hear your voice there. For the sake of the country and even the sake of the markets. I think you should operate prudently and with a little bit of calm in your voice today.

Well Cody, I'm about to play a very very rich interview with someone who has an answer, his own answer to your question.

Exactly.
And that's where you start seeing the actual numbers.
You're a CFO and you're looking at your balance sheet and you're like, now delinquencies are rising.
We've loaned this money out. It's not coming back at 7%. It's coming back at 6% or 5% because people are defaulting.
And then we can't resell the houses now because the market has started to decline.
And so if we buy a house, if the person bought a house at 700,000 we can only sell it now at 600,000 so now we're taking a loss, right?
Exactly.
Right.
When the losses began to accumulate and that's from the delinquencies that you mentioned a moment ago
and then the sales of homes at depressed prices or reduced prices, the losses began to occur.
Then what many companies did is they went out to find new sources of stock.
In the case of Wash Mutual, it went out in April of this year to a group of private investors and raised $7.2 billion in new stock
and that was intended to cover losses and actually help the bank bridge the gap in time to absorb the losses that were coming off the loan portfolio.
Unfortunately that didn't work, but oftentimes it does.
Oftentimes getting in additional capital is a way to make up for the losses that are now coming in and help the institution survive.
And many would have done that and some like Wash Mutual it wasn't enough, others will survive.
As somebody I feel like sometimes out in the public there's this sense that like it's a huge multinational,
in this case it wasn't multinational, but it's a huge $300 billion corporation.
How did it feel to be watching it go down?
Was there an emotional component for you?
Were you actually sad?
Did you actually sort of feel depression about it?
Well, let me give you an analogy.
So Wash Mutual failed last Thursday.
My sister-in-law died on Tuesday and she died of cancer.
We had known that she had a very aggressive cancer for two years and we knew that survival was unlikely
and as the time of her death approached it became more and more apparent that it was imminent.
So we all go through the grieving process with loved ones and particularly when we have time to absorb what's happening
it doesn't make it any less painful when the actual event occurs.
But we do have the opportunity to understand and go through that grieving process and cope with it.
And the same thing was true with Wash Mutual.
It wasn't like one day it was a great company and the next day it was put into receivership by the FDIC.
No, it progressed over a very long period of time.
So yes, there were emotional moments for me, unhappy moments, angry moments.
That's what you do through the grieving process.
But I had long since prior to last week come to accept the likely outcome.
Does that make sense to you?
And the thing that strikes me is that the very fact that you would compare it to the loss of a loved one
means that there was grief.
Yeah, so there definitely was grief on the part of many, many of the employees in the company.
And some were better, I was just going to say some were better prepared for that than others.
I mean you have devoted, you said 82, so 26 years of your life to this place.
Yeah.
So I understand how this affects a company that was in the mortgage market.
Companies like yours, Washington Mutual, and others that were sort of making a lot of home loans.
How does it spread though?
I mean that's what's being talked about now is that it's gone from being a mortgage problem to a system wide problem.
It's spreading.
Do you have any sense of how does that happen?
How does somebody who is making a lot of loans in the mortgage market spread to a bank that wasn't in the mortgage market as much?
Well, it spread in two different ways, so let's take them one at a time.
First of all, if you go back to the Washington Mutual example,
a large amount of the funds that were used to finance those loans that were made came from other institutions.
Then also a lot of the loans that were made by Washington Mutual were put into securities and sold to investors.
Right.
And the investors would be pension funds, money market mutual funds, you name it.
Other banks?
Other banks, insurance companies, foreign governments.
Right.
A lot of investors came from abroad.
So all these people are now holding paper, or securities I should say, that have losses in them.
Right.
As the housing prices turn down and delinquencies rise and losses begin to occur,
the losses are not just in the bank, but amongst a broad set of investors.
And then on the other side, the borrowed funds from these investors say,
well, if the bank fails, will I get paid off?
Because unlike a depositor who's insured by the FDIC,
the company that lends to the bank is not always protected.
I see.
And so what happens in a panic, it's like yelling fire in a theater.
You want to race for the exit, and it creates everybody.
You don't think, you just go.
And that's what's happened here in the last few weeks, is you've literally got a panic.
It's don't ask questions, just get your money out.
Right.
And if you, as an institution, you need people to lend you money,
like that is the entire business model of a bank.
If you can't get people to lend you at two and three percent,
you don't have any money to lend out at six or seven percent.
So you have no way of making money.
The lending side is critical, right?
Absolutely critical, yes.
And so what you're saying is if your bank becomes tainted
with the fear that we're going to lend you money and we're not going to get it back,
then all of a sudden your business model sort of goes down the tubes pretty rapidly.
If you can't raise that money, you can't sort of operate, right?
If the bank suddenly has less funds available to lend,
then the relationship they have with the small business customer,
and I'm just trying to give you an example here,
is the small business customer needs to have a draw on their line of credit
for, let's say, making a payroll payment or something of that sort.
Or some equipment.
And the bank doesn't have the money to give to them.
Right.
Or personalize it this way.
The homeowner has an equity line of credit
which they can draw upon to pay for junior's college expenses
or for vacation or home repairs or whatever.
Lots of people have home equity lines of credit that they use that way.
What the banks have now been doing since there's less funding available
is they have been arbitrarily reducing the lines of credit.
And so suddenly what people thought they could borrow
is not available any longer.
So those are real consequences for people
and for businesses, particularly small businesses.
And it creates uncertainty, it creates anxiety,
and at the worst, it actually makes it impossible for them
to pursue business plans
or pursue personal plans that they were intending to do.
And that has a consequence for the functioning of the economy.
So that's the consequence of a bank going down,
a bank like Washington Mutual or whatever going down,
and that's a consequence in the real economy.
Then the way it sort of spreads to other banks,
and let's just make sure I understand this.
I lent you money, I'm a bank, I lent you money,
I'm a company, I lent you money
in the form of a bond or something like that.
And then if you go down,
then that's a loss for me basically, right?
And that starts to cascade.
So just like you had losses on your lending side,
now they have losses on their lending side
and they're going through the same process that you went through
like borrow money and raise capital
and people start to worry about you.
That's exactly right.
If fear takes hold, you don't know who to trust,
you don't know who's the next one to fall
and cause you a loss,
so take no chances, just get your money out of there
into a safe place.
That's why back on the 19th of September
when really this current panic started,
the Treasury bill rate that day,
the 13-week Treasury bill rate went to zero.
Because people just wanted to be in a safe asset
even if it had no yield to it.
Bill, I feel like I want it to be rational panic.
Am I right?
I mean, irrational panic.
Because if it's irrational panic,
with a little bit of time,
everyone will calm down and figure things out.
If it's rational,
that means we really are as bad off as it seems.
With irrational, at least we got a shot
at coming out of this okay
with some time.
Well, so let me kind of rain on your parade
a little bit.
It is irrational panic at the moment
and that's what the Congress
and the President
and the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve
are all trying to deal with
is to take the panic out of the current situation
by passing a piece of legislation.
But there is a more fundamental issue
and so just passing a piece of legislation
and taking away the irrational
panic is not going to suddenly
mean that the economy is going to
be marvelous and recover.
You're still going to have losses that the system
has to absorb and until that's completed
there will continue to be negative
pressure on financial institutions
and probably negative
consequences for the economy as a whole.
I hope that doesn't sound too dark
but that's kind of it.
Well, because what you're saying
is that this process
is going to continue sort of no matter what.
If housing is at the bottom of all this
then loans are going to continue to deteriorate
in value and you're going to continue to have to raise money.
The process we need
you're not going to stop the home price fall.
Essentially
the objective has to be
to get them back to reasonable levels
and in the process of that occurring
is to contain the damage
the collateral damage that's occurring.
Right. So to make
sure that the panic doesn't spread
to make sure it doesn't go down.
Right. Because the panic actually
can make things far, far worse
than they need to be.
Let's just say
for now the worst happens.
Does it mean
like I walk around Manhattan
and there's a few more stores closed
there's a few more people out of work
but basically my life is the same?
Or does it mean I need a lot of canned
soup in my basement
and bottled water?
I don't think we're looking for a replay
of the 1930s here.
But people are talking about
the word Great Depression comes up an awful lot lately.
That's because the kinds of events
that are happening in the financial markets
right now we have not seen
since the 1930s. Quite frankly
we've had other financial crises
over the last few decades but nothing
about the current one. So it's
understandable that you would
get these kinds of comparisons. That doesn't mean
that we're headed in that direction.
It strikes me that, oh sorry.
Well I was just going to say
that student history
if you go back and study the 30s
there were enormous mistakes
made on the policy front that
did get into that amplification
and magnification that we were talking
about a moment ago where the panic didn't
so when everything you got up
to 25% unemployment
in the country. I don't
believe that's going to happen because
we have things in place today
that we didn't have in those days. We have
unemployment benefits, insurance
benefits to keep income
propped up. We have
deposit insurance which we
didn't have back then. And so
there are a lot of safety net
types of things that will cushion the blow.
And I am
optimistic ultimately that the
Congress and the administration and the Federal
Reserve will do things
that help cushion
the necessary correction
so that doesn't evolve into a panic
and a depression type of outcome.
Now let me just paint another
picture which I think
you're going to tell me is absolutely ridiculous
and is not at all possible. So this
other picture is a true meltdown of
our financial system where there
is, I go to the ATM machine
there's no cash there because the bank doesn't
have enough cash to put it there because they can't
get a line of credit.
I go, I want to
write a check but my bank
is under FDIC receivership and so is
every other bank around and
there's a chaos that has
ensued. My employer
can't pay me because they
can't get the short term loan
to make payroll
this month. And
I'm starting to
trade my furniture
for chickens in order to eat
because our
financial system has
broken. And I don't know who
has chickens. I don't even know where to go. There
is a place near me in Brooklyn that sells
live chickens. I'm going to go there today
and just make sure they have enough.
I'm going to get to know them. Honey, don't forget to bring
the stuffed chair. Don't forget to bring the rocking
chair. We need some chickens tonight. Yeah.
That we become a barter economy
that money ceases to have any
meaning. Is that
on the table? No, absolutely
not. So you're right. That's
utterly ridiculous.
Let me play the other
let me just my question
is the following.
I hear people sort of
talking about like very dire consequences
but then when people lay out the dire consequences
it sounds like a pretty severe recession
which I've lived through. We've all lived
through.
Or maybe not even that severe recession.
Maybe like you know
late 70s, early 80s, something like
that. Now
the bailout
bill that as we are talking
now was defeated. It's coming up for a vote
again in the Senate tonight.
It's $700 billion
in public money that's going to go to
sort of
by necessity it's going to go
to the same people who
made some
bad decisions probably, right?
And there is
a sense I think on the
behalf of the public and you know
part of me shares that
sense that is this
you know if we believe in the free market
which I think we do, isn't there an argument
to be made that
won't the market sort of sort itself out?
There are banks that are strong. They will
take over the banks that are weak. They will start
lending. They have to lend. That is the only way a bank
makes money. There are people with
cash. They have to lend it out. That is the only way they
make money. You know there are companies
that are solvent, that are good credit
risks, that people are going to be happy to lend
money to. Isn't there
an argument to be made that
why should the taxpayer
be on the hook for
bailing out companies that
didn't make good decisions?
You raised basically
what I would say are two different
issues. Okay.
One has to do with the
bailout, but the other has to do with
what is the responsibility
of the public authorities. Now
if you're a true believer in
free markets, you could
argue, and those true
believers do, is the market will
correct itself. Well
but at what cost
in the process and what we
were discussing earlier was the potential
for an ordinary downturn
and correction, a necessary
correction and purging of excesses
to spin out of control and
move into panic and perhaps
even depression. So there is
a role for
public authorities, for public policy
to manage the
correction in a way that it doesn't spin
out of control and create needless
damage and potentially
lead to panic. So that would be
my first point.
And that's what the Congress and the administration
are attempting to do. And when they say dire
consequences, if you don't do this, they're
referring to, we can't promise
that the market will
self-correct in an orderly fashion. It might
indeed very bad things happen
if we don't intervene.
The other point I would make has to do
with the, let's come back to the $700
billion because it has been
billed as a bailout
and it really is not, but it's
the fault of the
administration for not explaining that
properly.
What is being
imposed is a fund
of Treasury money
up to $700 billion to
purchase distressed assets
at fair market
prices. And if
that is done
appropriately in
terms of the price discovery and
buying those assets,
then the Treasury will end up
with the balance sheet that we talked about
earlier, is it will have
not $700 billion in
face value loans, but $700
billion in loans
fair value or what's
recoverable value against
$700 billion in Treasury securities
where we've done the borrowing, so the balance sheet
will equal. It will hold those
until the crisis passes.
They will collect
the principal payments and eventually
whatever's left they will sell.
But there is every chance that
at the end of the day,
the Treasury will end up
even, so there will be no loss
whatsoever to the taxpayer. It might
even end up with a profit.
There's a chance there will be a loss, but it's certainly
not anywhere close to $700
billion. So simply to say, this is
a bailout of Wall Street and it's
going to be $700 billion
loss to the taxpayers is just
not the correct interpretation.
Nobody has explained that at all
pretty well. And so
it's easy for everyone to say, oh
$700 billion, we're bailing out
Wall Street, the taxpayers are
bearing the burden, that's a bad
thing. That was William Longbreak,
former Chief Financial Officer
of Washington Mutual. He talked to Alex
Bloomberg and Adam Davidson.
And that's the Planet Money podcast
for today, Thursday, October
2nd. We're off to watch the great vice
presidential debate. I'm Laura Conaway.
Take care.
