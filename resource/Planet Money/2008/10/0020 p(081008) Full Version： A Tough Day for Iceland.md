If you got a truncated version of the Oct. 7 Planet Money, here's the real deal. We're making stops in Iceland, New York City and the Federal Reserve.

**(President Bush):**
In my presidency, we have faced tough times after the terrorist attack of 9-11, and we came through strongly. And we're going to come through this.

No question the times are tough, but no question America will emerge.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.

I'm Alex Bloomberg, and I'm here with Laura Conaway.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Nice to see you.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
And today is Tuesday, October 7th. It's 4.45 p.m. here in New York.

And that clip we just played was President Bush speaking earlier today about the economy. More bad news there.

The stock market has lost more than 1,400 points in the last five sessions. That's 13% of its value. The Federal Reserve has made some moves, and we'll talk about that a little bit later.

A lot of people have been asking on the blog how they can follow the economy. Should they look at the stock market or what part of the stock market?

Adam Davidson and I talked earlier today to a trader named Vinnie Catalano.

And just before we play this interview, you should know one term that we use. We talk about the credit markets. Just a way to think about that, if the stock market is a place where you can go and own a piece of a company, the credit markets is where you go and you look and you see how much it costs to borrow money.

That's true whether you're a person buying a mortgage or a gigantic multinational corporation trying to borrow a billion dollars.

If you want to find out how much it will cost you to borrow money, what the rate will be, you go to the credit markets.

That's where you look.

**(Adam Davidson):**
The reason I wanted to talk to you, Vinnie, is you had a post today that was just screamingly, it was just exactly something I have been saying all week.

Can you just spell it out?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Surely.

The title of the blog posting today is Keep Your Eye on the Credit Markets Ball.

It's not really the stock market, it's the credit market.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wait a second, Vinnie.

We hear every hour on the news, the front of the news. Dow Jones collapses 800 points, falls below 10,000. Dow Jones falls another 700 points.

That's what we hear all the time. That's got to be the most important information.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Actually, I beg to differ.

It is important. It does matter, but right now what really matters most is what's going on in the credit markets.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
You're saying that for everyday people, the stock market, sure it's going to affect their 401Ks, their pension funds and everything like that, but on their day-to-day life, the economy, their microeconomy of their lives is much more affected by these things called the credit markets.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That is correct, but also their investments and their stock market investments will be affected by whether or not this freeze thaws.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right.

So if you were advising people, don't look at the Dow Jones if you want to freak yourself out. Here's what you look at to freak yourself out, and you're saying you want to look at two indices in particular.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That's correct.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
what are they now?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Well, I would look at the treasury bond rates, specifically the three-month rate, treasury bills actually, and see if they are going up in yield, which means that less money is going into them and people are getting less panicky, and then I would look at what the rate is between the banks that they lend to one another.

That's called the LIBOR.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Okay.

So the treasury yield, so the three-month treasury, that is the secret, that's the sort of secret gauge of how panicked people with money are about where they're going to put it.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That's correct.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
And the higher that goes...

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Exactly right.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So if I'm...

Okay, so I'm an investor, I'm not an investor, I'm a person, I'm getting up in the morning and I'm like, I'm going to try to figure out how freaked out I should be today. I go...

Where do I go?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Where you can go is frankly a great location, totally free is Yahoo Finance.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So I go to Yahoo Finance and I type in three-month treasury, right?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Well, actually on the left-hand side on the navigation bar, there will be a link to bonds.

In fact, let me look at it right here on the screen.

**(Adam Davidson):**
I'm going to do it too, Vinny.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
It'll say, view more bonds. And it'll be under the market summary.

Okay?

And if you don't have market summary opened up when you go there, open it up, click on it.

And there's two indices underneath, there's two links. One says, view more indices, which is good for stocks, the other one is view more bonds. And all you have to do is click on the view more bonds and voila.

**(Adam Davidson):**
All right.

So I'm looking at the three-month.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
It's the US treasury bond rates right there.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
All right. So the three months, so I look at the three-month and what's...

What are you seeing, Vinny?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
I'm seeing 0.74% today versus 0.35 yesterday versus 1.67 a month ago.

What it's telling me is that rates are going up a bit, less money is going into treasuries, fear is diminishing a bit, but it's not as good as it was a month ago.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So 

**(Adam Davidson):**
the higher the number is, the calmer we can be.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Correct.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And so, okay.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
That's very helpful.

**(Adam Davidson):**
That's really helpful.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
And that's because generally, the lower the treasury rate, that means the more people, the more investors are taking their money out of other things like lending it to each other and to banks and to us and to everybody else who needs money, and they're just giving it to the government because they're afraid that if they lend it to us, we're not going to pay it back.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That's correct.

It's called a flight equality. This is a panic equality.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right.

Because no matter how good an investment I may be or my business may be, I can't print money like the U.S. government can.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That's correct.

And this is where everybody goes and they're taking money out of money markets, professional investors too, taking them out and stuffing them into treasuries, three-month treasuries, and this is a great gauge to see just how significant the fear factor is and whether it's alleviating.

Now, by the way, if I may mention, several days ago, this rate was, you're ready, 0.05%. It was almost at 0% yield.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Meaning the U.S. government could borrow money for three months and pay no interest effectively.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Effectively no interest. That's correct.

That's how great the fear was. That's sticking it under the mattress. That's the equivalent.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So if our listeners wake up in a week from now and they click on Yahoo Finance and they go to view more bonds and they find the three-month treasury rate at 0.00 or 0.01 or something like that, that's when they start throwing their hands in the air and wailing at the sky?

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Yes, definitely.

And that's where, that's right, and that's where your stock market portfolio, let's take the Dow Jones.

The Dow Jones would be closer to 8,000 than to 10,000 if you saw something like that because it's telling you that the fear is still great and no matter what the government is doing, it just doesn't seem to be working.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Now, you said there's another number.

So that's one of the numbers. And walk us through this other number. You said the LIBOR number.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Sure.

The other number you can find on Bloomberg.com.

**(Adam Davidson):**
All right. Let's go there.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Kind of have to hunt around for it a little bit, but it's called the TED spread, okay?

And what the TED spread is, it's a very simple calculation. It's one rate compared to another. It's how much banks are lending to one another minus the three-month treasury rate.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Okay.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Okay?

And that's another measure of fear. And if you want to see that rate come down because you want to see that they are lending money to one another, the banks are, and you want to see that rate come down, and that's not happening because that rate right now is in excess of 4%.

This rate, by the way, was right around before all the panic and everything else occurred. It was more like 1%. It's now up at 3.5%.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wow.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
So, you know, it's basically 250% higher in fear than it was not too long ago.

And again, this is like the safest of the safe of money between banks, overnight money, and that's how great the fear is. And these are the two you want to watch.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So in other words, what you're saying is like, here's the safest, if I have a lot of money, the safest place I can put it, if I don't want it lost, I put it in U.S. treasuries.

That's the safest place because in order for me not to get my money back, the U.S. government has to disappear, which won't happen.

Now, the second safest place I can put my money is I can loan it to another bank overnight.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Well, no, that doesn't quite happen that way because banks are lending to one another.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right. That's what I'm saying.

No, no, I'm a bank.

No, no, I'm a bank in this situation.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Right.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
So I'm a bank.

The safest place I put my money is the treasuries. The second safe as a bank, the second safest place I can put it is I can loan it to another bank, one of my fellow banks overnight. They're going to give it back to me the very next day. They're a bank.

So that's considered a very safe rate.

And what you're saying right now is the rate that the government is charging me is zero and the rate that a bank is charging me is four percent, basically.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
No, you can look at it that way. That's correct.

Think of it this way as far as the banks are concerned. Make me your bank, OK?

You can borrow from the Treasury, from the Fed, at two percent. And anything above that is profit.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
OK.

So if you were to lend it out to another bank, because the other bank needs it for their businesses, that they're lending it to, right?

If you can lend it from one bank, like one of the core banks, like a JP Morgan, you lend it to another bank, maybe a smaller bank, at a three percent rate or a four percent rate. I mean, you know, that's where you can go with this to earn a terrific rate of return.

And they're afraid. They're just fearful of doing this.

So these are measures to watch to see if the deep freeze is thawing.

If you look at them, the easiest way is the Treasury, like I mentioned before. And this one becomes a little bit more involved to monitor.

But this is what will give you an indication of how stocks ultimately are going to do better or they're not going to do better. I mean, this is, if you're looking for something

that's the epicenter of the storm, this is it.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
The Ted spread.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Yes, because they've got to get businesses to lend. They've got to get banks to lend to businesses. They've got to get investors to put money into short-term instruments.

I just saw, for example, the state of Massachusetts has postponed the $700 million bond issue because of the money market conditions, because they can't get the money at the rates that they want them at.

Last week, Schwarzenegger and the state of California says, if we don't get money within the next 30 days, we're going to have to start laying people off.

This isn't because the state is out of business or out of money. What it means is that the way businesses function is that they go to the markets to borrow on a short-term basis. Businesses do this.

For example, many businesses make no money throughout the whole year and they make all their money at the end of the year around Christmastime.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Like a toy company or an electronics company or something.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Exactly.

Well, how do you maintain your cash flows, pay your bills and all of that throughout the year?

You basically don't accumulate all the money and then dole it out month after month after month. Now what you typically do is that you borrow on a short-term basis, knowing that at the end of the year, you're going to make it all back and then you're going to pay off all the bills and you'll have a nice profit at the end of the year.

Well, when you shut down that borrowing, then the ability to make payroll, to buy equipment that's going to be sold for later on, that becomes impaired significantly.

Now you're impacting the real economy. That's the big danger here, not the stock market. The stock market is simply reflecting this danger.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right, and so what you're saying is the reason Massachusetts can't borrow money, the reason California can't borrow money, nobody's lending it to them.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
Correct.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
And that fear to lend to anybody is, that is this TED spread number. That is this 4% number.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
That's correct, yeah.

If you look at, all you have to do is monitor this. This is the epicenter. This will tell you whether or not the actions by the Treasury and the Fed and the other central banks and the manifestation of that is going to be whether or not you see this TED spread start to decline.

And if you do, then you know that things are starting to work and what will happen is you'll see the stock market reflect that and start to go up.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Great, well, thank you so much Vinnie. That was fabulous and we'd love to have you back talking about these issues.

And again, that was Vinnie Catalano, President and Global Investment Strategist for Blue Marble Research here in New York.

We're gonna link to his blog, vinniecatalano.blogspot.com.

Thanks so much.

**(Vinnie Catalano):**
My pleasure, thank you so much.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
That was Trader Vinnie Catalano talking with Adam Davidson and me. And we'll put those links that he was talking about in our interview on our blog at npr.org slash money.

**(Laura Conaway):**
You know, I came in today with this news about Iceland actually.

It said something like, Iceland is on the verge of bankruptcy. Literally, it was with a headline in the Wall Street Journal.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Right, and that is some crazy news because you sort of think that a country can't go bankrupt, but apparently Iceland is close.

The government has been making announcements about the economy there and it turns out.

**(Laura Conaway):**
They're not really true.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Yeah, they've been sort of lying about the state of their economy. And now it seems to be in free fall and no one can quite get a handle on what's happening.

So we called up Lars Christensen, Chief Analyst at Danske Bank based in Copenhagen and asked him what's going on with Iceland.

**(Lars Christensen):**
We can say Iceland has for some time been first in line to be hit on a country level by the global credit crunch.

And Iceland is probably the first country to really fall into a very, very serious recession due to the global credit crunch. And we have seen very, very sharp fall in the Icelandic corona.

On Monday alone, it fell by more than 30% and the turmoil has continued today.

**(Adam Davidson):**
That's 30% after falling a lot over the last few months, right?

**(Lars Christensen):**
Yes, yes.

We have seen since August 2007, the Icelandic corona has been in a very sharp fall and that has accelerated this week.

And we have now out of the three large Icelandic banks two have been basically nationalized, put under government control, Lidnia and Landsbanking.

So only one of the large Icelandic banks is standing.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So the Icelandic government is effectively taking almost socializing.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Effectively, the Icelandic government has nationalized two of three major banks in the country and at the moment is itself struggling very seriously to pay off its debt.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So right now Iceland is, would you call it the most destabilized economy in the world right now?

I guess we have-

**(Lars Christensen):**
I think it's by far the country in the world that is suffering the most from the credit crunch.

And comparing to other countries in the world that are also suffering from this, it's very clear that Iceland is the country that I'm in most distress.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Now why is that?

I think most of us, when we think of Iceland, we think of happy blonde people and imagine everything's very nice.

**(Lars Christensen):**
There is absolutely good reason to think about that.

But on the economic front, the banks and the households have probably been a little bit too happy and departing a little bit too much in recent years.

We've seen Icelandic debt levels and foreign debt especially accelerate very, very dramatically-

**(Adam Davidson):**
They're borrowing huge amounts of money from overseas.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Oh, that's true.

And a lot of that has been foreign currency lending. So that has been quite dramatic in terms of the raising of debt.

**(Adam Davidson):**
There was something very odd. You wrote a note today that you sent out that the prime minister announced that he was borrowing money from Russia but then Vladimir Putin said, that's not true. We're not giving them any money.

Can you explain-

**(Lars Christensen):**
Well, apparently first Icelandic government said it had reached a deal with Russia to get a loan of three or four billion euros with the Russian government.

That was later denied by the Russian government and this is highly unorthodox.

So until now, it's pretty hard to say where we are on this. So on any of the circumstances, it raised a lot of eyebrows around the world that Iceland is now maybe trying to get a loan with the Russian government.

**(Adam Davidson):**
What's next?

What are we gonna see in Iceland?

**(Lars Christensen):**
I think it's a little bit premature to take a very bleak scenario of a national default but I think it's very clear that the Iceland need outside helps get back on its feet and I think the IMF is most likely as international institution coming in and helping out to have a restructuring of the Icelandic economy and as with the American banks needing a rescue package, the Icelandic economy certainly needs a rescue package.

**(Adam Davidson):**
The whole country needs it.

The whole country needs a rescue package.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Yes.

I think the key issue here is that the banks in Iceland are significantly larger on the economy.

The balance sheet of the Iceland banks is eight to 10 times larger than the Icelandic economy and therefore you can't rescue the banks if the banks are significantly larger because of a lot of foreign exposure than the country.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So the Icelandic banks are 10 times bigger than the entire economy, meaning they're many, many times bigger than the government.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Yes.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So the government can't, that's not the case in the U.S.

In the U.S. the U.S. government.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Exactly and that's why you can't effectively have a rescue plan in the U.S. but that's much harder to do or impossible without having a serious de-leveraging and what will happen is and what we're seeing now is Icelandic banks are of course being taken over by government but it's also selling off all of these activities abroad and scaling down very, very dramatically what we call de-leveraging and of course that is having a severe impact on the credit situation in Iceland.

Effectively the Icelandic krona is now only being traded in Iceland.

So the situation is quite dramatic.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Lars, thank you so much. We're gonna be monitoring Iceland carefully because it seems like they're in serious trouble.

I guess if we wanted to say who's second most in danger would that be Hungary?

**(Lars Christensen):**
Well, I think you should look in Central and Eastern Europe.

I don't wanna point fingers. There's a lot of finger pointing at the moment so.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Let's point a few fingers.

Slovakia, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Well, I think you're closing in.

We'll see.

**(Adam Davidson):**
All right, thanks a lot Lars.

**(Lars Christensen):**
Okay, bye.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Thanks to Lars Kristensen for coming on the show. What do we got next, Laura?

**(Laura Conaway):**
I sat Adam down in the chair and I asked him to take a question from a listener.

So Adam.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Hey Laura.

**(Laura Conaway):**
I've been getting this question all day from listeners and people coming around the blog.

This version of it comes from Marissa Brandt. She says, the Fed recently announced that it will purchase commercial paper.

Is that with money from the bailout or is it additional treasury funds? How much money can the treasury really create in that way? Isn't this going to contribute to the devaluation of the dollar?

Take that.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wow, these are fabulous questions and I gotta say, we always get fabulous questions. I really like the questions.

This harkens back a little bit to something we talked about yesterday, which is how the Fed is different from the treasury department.

So the quick answer is no, this is not part of the $700 billion bailout and also, no, this is not treasury department money.

So the Fed and the treasury department have very different roles.

You remember Laura, we talked about the Fed is monetary policy, the treasury is fiscal.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Fiscal policy. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Fiscal policy. I so remember it. Tax and spend. You remember it.

Right, so the treasury is like, it's almost like a business. They make money mostly through taxes and they spend money like on roads and hospitals and aircraft carriers and things like that.

The Federal Reserve is very different. They effectively create money. They add money to the economy and sometimes they subtract money from the economy.

**(Laura Conaway):**
But this thing with the Fed and buying commercial paper, what is commercial paper and what are they buying? From whom are they buying it?

**(Adam Davidson):**
So commercial paper is like a big IOU.

A bank says, hey Laura, I need a billion dollars to get me through the next three months because I got some short-term needs for money.

I'll give you 1.1 billion three months from now if you give me a billion today.

And what I give you is this IOU. It's called commercial paper. It's basically a short-term bond.

So what the Fed is gonna do is they're gonna be the one who gives the money. So Bank of America, just to pick an example, or Citibank or whatever. 0Every time I do this thinking of a bank, I only think of banks that no longer exist.

So a bank that exists says, boy, we need a billion dollars. Now until two weeks ago, it was easy. They go to the commercial paper market. They call some guy on Wall Street and they say, hey, we need this. And the guy on Wall Street puts it up on a computer. And pretty soon some other bank that has an extra billion dollars lying around says, no problem, here's your billion. We'll take the IOU and we'll get our 1.1 billion back three months from now.

That 1.1 is a little off because no one's making 10% interest in three months. But anyway, you get the rough idea.

So now they get to go straight to the Federal Reserve. Now the Fed is gonna make it a little less attractive. They're gonna charge a fee.  They're not gonna accept as high, they're not gonna accept anything high risk. They're only gonna buy from the most top rated companies, the most secure companies. And they're going to,

so Bank of America or whomever can go straight. And the banks already can do this through other vehicles but now General Electric could go to the Fed and say, we need a billion to get us through the next three months. We wanna open some new factories. We wanna pay our payroll, whatever it is. We need a billion bucks.

That commercial paper market has completely frozen. No, there's no movement there or there wasn't until today.

So we are gonna go straight to the Fed and we're gonna ask the Fed to give us the billion dollars.

**(Laura Conaway):**
The Fed is sort of like the all night taco stand here and that they're there when no one else is.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Right.

Now what I think they're hoping and what seems to possibly be happening, they are hoping that simply by saying they will do this, it gives confidence to the market and then someone else will step in and say, well.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And what money are they using to say, we'll do this.

**(Adam Davidson):**
The Fed has money.

They have their own balance sheet, which is, but they are running through it very quickly. I don't remember the last time I looked at it but they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the last few months. 

**(Laura Conaway):**
Fanny, Freddie.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Fanny, Freddie, all this stuff. When they run out of that, they do have to go to the Treasury Department and say, hey, we need some more money.

So that comes from us, from taxpayers. I believe we are not yet there. I'm pretty sure we're not yet there, but we're close. We're closer than we've been in a very long time.

So I guess you can effectively say this is taxpayer money but it's totally separate from the 700 billion.

The idea here though is this is pretty safe. So we are gonna get paid back and we'll actually probably make money on this deal because we're only gonna lend to the most credit-worthy, trustworthy companies.

**(Laura Conaway):**
I'm smiling.

**(Adam Davidson):**
You're smiling because the most credit-worthy, trustworthy companies have been collapsing.

**(Laura Conaway):**
I'm a believer, Adam, thank you.

**(Adam Davidson):**
All right, thank you, Laura.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And thanks, Marissa Brant.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Keep those questions coming, everyone.

**(Laura Conaway):**
Yeah, we're at npr.org slash money.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
And that's the Planet Money podcast for today. I'm Alex Bloomberg.

**(Laura Conaway):**
And I'm Laura Conaway.

**(Alex Bloomberg):**
Thanks for listening.
