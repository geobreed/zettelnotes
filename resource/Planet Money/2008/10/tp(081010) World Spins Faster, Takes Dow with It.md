Wall Street set a new benchmark today. Oct. 10 marked the first time the Dow Jones Industrial Average has traveled a thousands points in a single day. Meanwhile, the wheels of the great bailout machine rolled forward. A listener asks everyone's mortgage question. And a panhandler finds his niched in the faltering global economy.

**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**
Secretary Paulson will also meet with finance ministers from the world's
20 leading economies. Through these efforts the world is sending an
unmistakable signal. We're in this together
and we'll come through this together.
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. This is where we try and take all this
confusing, overwhelming, financial, economic crisis news and just make it
understandable, interesting, even funny sometimes. I'm Adam Davidson. And I'm
Laura Conaway. That was the president you just heard over the chirping birds.
I think the CNN people headline the speech, President Bush Appeals for
Confidence. Confidence has not been the watchword of the day. I don't think too
many people on Wall Street listen to the president too carefully. Today is
Friday, October 10th. It is 537 p.m. here in New York. Yeah, Adam, I've been
watching our Twitter crowd today. We're twitter.com slash planet money and
they've spent the day watching the Dow swing around. It looks like it
doesn't know which way is up, down, north, south. Can you please tell them
what is going on? Well, honestly, I wish I could. Today, for some reason,
this was the day I liked the least. I mean, these have all been
overwhelming, confusing, frustrating days, but they've been kind of
exciting. And at most days, there's something of a clear narrative. The
narrative might change day to day. Today was just confusing. I mean,
the Dow, you know, it dropped 600 points. You think, oh, I get what's
happening. It's a full sell off. Then it creeps way back up above
where it opened. Seemed to be doing it in moments. Dina Temple
Raston was saying that she thought it was just rumors of this and that,
whether the G7 might do something this week. Yeah, I've been hearing
rumors all day long. Huge room. Oh, the U.S. government is about to
bail out Morgan Stanley. The U.S. government is about to start buying
tons of banks all over the country. The G7, the seven big
industrialized nations who are meeting in Washington this week, the
finance ministers are all meeting in Washington this week. They're
going to announce some big decision. None of it has come to pass so
far, although who knows by the time you're listening to this
podcast, maybe you'll know stuff we don't. Well, Henry Paulson is
talking in just a bit. Yeah, in one hour we're going to hear from
Henry Paulson. It might be a boring old press conference tied to
the G7 or he might say we're moving off of money and moving to
a barter system. Go on to shelves. Whatever it is, you'll find
it here at npr.org slash money. We'll be following it even after
we publish this podcast. And if you want to know more, it'll
definitely be on our blog, npr.org slash money. Yeah. The other
thing I've been getting from readers all the time is a question
about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It comes in different forms. The
thing is people out there are listening to John McCain and
Barack Obama bat this Fannie and Freddie thing all over the
campaign trail. And this weekend, our friends over at
This American Life are partners really, they're diving into the
financial crisis again. And you can hear the full show from
PRI on public radio stations all over the country. In the clip
I'm just about to preview for you. Ira Glass sits down with
another friend of ours Charles Duhigg of the New York Times.
Now Duhigg is a serious, serious guy. He's broken major
news about Fannie and Freddie all year. And I don't
necessarily get Fannie and Freddie all the way. But
Charles Duhigg does.
You've probably heard by now over the last few years, the
mortgage industry and the banking industry have been
places that were rife with invention. People coming up
with all kinds of better mousetraps, subprime
mortgages and credit default swaps and novel kinds of
mortgage-backed securities, all of which have sent the
world's economy into a tailspin these last few weeks.
As part of our ongoing coverage of that mess, we now
turn to the politics of all this. Last week on our radio
show, we debunked an idea you hear a lot from Democrats
these days, that this financial mess can be blamed
entirely on Republicans deregulating financial
markets. Today, we take a look at the other side of
the aisle. This past week, it seems to have actually
hardened into a point of Republican dogma, that the
whole financial mess can be blamed on the Democrats. On
Wednesday of this past week, I attended a McCain-Palan
rally in Lehigh, Pennsylvania. And I was amazed that
nearly every person I talked to in this Republican
crowd was quite certain who the culprits were behind
the whole financial mess.
The liberal Democrats in the House encouraged and
supported the notion that banks should be providing
loans to people who couldn't afford them in
inner city wherever.
They saw the McCain and Bush coming through with
the regulations and they refused to do anything about
it. Barney, Frank said, no, it's OK, no problems, it's
running great. And here we are today.
In this Republican version of the bailout story,
there was a pivotal moment in 2005 when
Republicans could have prevented a lot of the
mess that we're in now, where they tried to
regulate, where they tried to fix it. But the
Democrats stopped them. And the key to the whole
crisis, they say, was the mortgage companies,
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They say Fannie and
Freddie are at the center of the whole thing.
Here's John McCain at the second presidential
debate on Tuesday.
Really, the match that lit this fire was Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.
I'll bet you, you may never even have heard of
them before this crisis.
But, you know, they're the ones that with the
encouragement of Senator Obama and his cronies
and his friends in Washington that went out
and made all these risky loans, gave them to
people that couldn't never afford to pay
back.
So let's just start with the question, did
the subprime crisis start with Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac?
Absolutely not. The subprime crisis did not
start with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
This is Charles Duhigg, who covers Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac and other parts of the
subprime crisis for the New York Times.
He says that it was not Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, but Wall Street, international investors,
brokers and banks who created and popularized
subprime mortgages. Fannie and Freddie
didn't get involved in a serious way until
relatively late.
This huge subprime economy had built. Wall
Street came in and they said, we're going
to basically buy any loan that anyone can
make. And Fannie and Freddie at that point
started losing a lot of their market share.
So they started competing against Wall
Street for worse and worse and riskier and
riskier loans. And that in turn further
fueled the growth of this thing.
So what started out as a kind of small
brush fire that was worrisome was fanned
over time into a huge, huge blaze.
And Fannie and Freddie were an important
part of fanning that. But they didn't
create the subprime economy.
They weren't the single greatest input to
the subprime economy.
They were part of the problem.
Nonetheless, Republicans say that if
they'd been allowed to regulate Fannie
May and Freddie Mac back in 2005, as
they'd wanted, would have prevented
much of the current mess.
I was the one who called at the time
for tighter restrictions on Fannie May
and Freddie Mac that could have helped
prevent this crisis, could have helped
prevent from happening in the first
place. And Senator Obama was silent on
the regulation of Fannie May and Freddie
Mac and his Democratic allies in
Congress opposed every effort to rein
them in.
So, Charles, what are they talking
about? What what did Republicans try to
do a couple of years ago?
So in 2005, a couple of Republicans
introduced legislation that would have
placed greater restrictions on Fannie
and Freddie would have empowered the
regulator to basically have a tighter
hold on them. Now, what's important to
keep in mind is John McCain didn't
actually sponsor that legislation
initially. He came to it kind of, you
know, months and months after it had
been introduced and after a big report
had come out saying that Fannie and
Freddie are terrible companies.
Everyone was kind of jumping on and
John McCain jumped on to co-sponsor
the legislation. People we've
interviewed in the Senate have said
that John McCain was never a big,
you know, bugaboo on Fannie or Freddie.
But he did co-sponsor legislation.
He deserves some some credit for that.
The 2005 legislation would have
essentially done two things.
First of all, it would have cut the
number of loans that Fannie and Freddie
can hold for themselves.
So it would have avoided part of the
problem that Freddie is having right
now. And theoretically, it might have
caused Fannie and Freddie to stop
buying so many risky loans.
But that's not a guarantee.
In fact, it would have been
completely up to the regulator.
And the regulator who's holding the
position right now is a man named
James Lockhart. In the past year,
and he was a Bush appointee, in the
past year, he actually helped Fannie
and Freddie buy more and more riskier
loans because Congress over the past
year started asking Fannie and Freddie
to buy risky loans because they
thought that would help the economy.
Right now, it's a part of Republican
orthodoxy, it seems, that if we
had fixed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
in 2005, we wouldn't be in the
crisis we're in today.
Is that true?
That's absolutely not true.
So if we had fixed Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac in 2005, the crisis
might be different and it might be
slightly less. But the crisis would
absolutely still be here.
Another thing that's come up as a
political talking point is is the
question of who associated with who.
And Senator McCain said in
Pennsylvania this week that
executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac have advised Senator Obama.
The executives of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac have advised him and
he's taken their money for his
campaign.
In fact, he's received more money
from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac than
any other senator in history with
the exception of the chairman of
the committee overseeing them.
The McCain campaign also has an ad
linking Barack Obama to an
executive at Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac.
Obama has no background in
economics. Who advises him?
The Post says it's Franklin
Reigns for advice on mortgage
and housing policy. Shocking.
Under Reigns, Fannie Mae
committed extensive financial
fraud. Reigns made millions.
Fannie Mae collapsed.
Taxpayers? Stuck with the bill.
Barack Obama.
Bad advice.
Bad instincts.
Not ready to lead.
Franklin Reigns, right, which is
based on apparently Barack Obama
and Franklin Reigns once bumped
into each other at some type of
get together.
What Barack Obama said is that
they had one conversation very
briefly once.
So it's a little disingenuous
to say that Franklin Reigns was
an adviser to Barack Obama.
Now, that being said, if you're
following the money trail, if you
want to say who's taken less or
more money from Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, Barack Obama, it
is absolutely true, is the
second highest recipient of
lobbying dollars from Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac.
Now, the reason why what John
McCain is saying is a little
disingenuous is because his
campaign manager, John
McCain's campaign manager, a
guy named Rick Davis, was a
lobbyist for Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and took over two
million dollars from them in
lobbying fees to run this
group that they had put
together to try and fight back
against more regulation.
And in fact, although although
Rick Davis left his firm when
he joined the McCain campaign,
his firm that he still owns a
pardon was receiving payments
from Freddie Mac until earlier
this year, until earlier this
year, just until a month or
two ago.
Right. Yeah. Yeah.
I think I think it ended in
August. I'm not I'm not
certain of exactly the date.
And in fact, I worked on the
story sort of breaking that.
And what they said, the reason
why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
were paying Rick Davis, John
McCain's campaign manager, is
because they wanted access to
John McCain. They thought that
maybe he'd become president
someday. And so it'd be good
to be friends with a guy who's
one of his closest aides in
general. Charles Duhigg says
it's true that Republicans have
tried to rein in Freddie Mac
and Fannie Mae for years.
And it's true that in general
Democrats have urged Fannie and
Freddie to take on more loans
and riskier loans and push
for loose spending and low
interest rates that led to the
housing boom.
And it's also true that
Republicans fought regulation of
the financial markets.
But he says none of that gets to
the overall truth of what
happened. To say that either
party had great foresight is
completely untrue.
So the blame for this is
bipartisan. The blame for this
is absolutely bipartisan.
Both parties deserve a great
deal of blame for what
happened with the subprime
mess and to try and pin the
blame on one party or the
other really muddies the
issue. A crisis like what's
going on right now can't
develop without everyone fueling
it. I mean, we're looking at
the biggest crisis in a century.
That only happens when basically
everyone drops the ball.
So there's enough blame to
give to both parties here.
When it comes down to specific
individuals, some individuals
deserve a lot more blame than
others. And the time
suspending, you know, a
couple of weeks basically
trying to point our fingers
at who deserves that blame.
And we know people who are
especially good or especially
bad. Were Barack Obama and
John McCain, either of them
especially great or especially
terrible?
No, Barack Obama cares about
a whole bunch of other
things than Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and subprime.
John McCain cares about a
whole bunch of things besides
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
subprime. They spent most of
their careers talking about
things besides Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and subprime.
This just wasn't a big issue
for them.
Thanks so much to Ira Glass
and our good friends and
partners at Chicago Public
Radio's This American Life.
You can hear that show all
weekend long on Public
Radio International stations
near you or go to this life
dot org. Thanks also to
Charles Duhigg. He's also a
good buddy of ours. He's over
at the New York Times.
Now, the other thing we've
been paying a lot of
attention to behind the
scenes we haven't talked as
much about on the podcast is
the exact mechanism of how
the U.S. government is going
to buy these troubled
assets. It's toxic waste
that the Treasury Department
is going to spend seven
hundred billion dollars on.
Probably not a garage
sale. It's not a garage
sale, but it's not that
different from a garage sale
in a way, as David
Kestenbaum, playing at
money as David Kestenbaum
found out. He talked to
one of the guys who is
on the forefront of
creating the kind of
auction that the
government is going to
use.
The hope is that just by
having the auction, it
will actually start people
trading these toxic
mortgage-backed securities
again. And I have to say
that did not make a lot
of sense to me. And I
had a long discussion with
Larry Ossibel at the
University of Maryland who's
working on a design for
the auction. And he gave
me this example of a
tiny market that was
stuck. Actually, it
involves him personally.
It was stuck because no
one knew what things
were worth. And then it
got unstuck. And I know
this isn't really
relevant, but I have to
tell you that Larry
Ossibel has this
excellent big walrus
mustache.
Suppose you own a
house. Suppose that
there are 20 houses for
sale in your
neighborhood and none
of them have sold in
the past year. What's
your house worth? No
any good ways of doing
an assessment of it? No
any ways of appraising
it? If there are 20
for sale and no
transactions are
occurring?
Yeah, I add up the
bricks and I see what I
could sell the bricks
for.
There you go. That's
why you're not an
economist. Where are
we? To continue the
analogy a little bit
more, I moved to
Washington after the
last peak in the real
estate market. And the
house that we ended up
buying, it was one of
two houses on a short
block, both of which
had been on the
market for over a
year. Both perfectly
lovely houses, but
both at asking prices
that were really
unrealistic. So we
decided we wanted one
of them and we made
what the seller surely
viewed as a really
lowball offer, but we
bargained a little. It
was a lot lower than
what they wanted. We
bought the house and a
few weeks later the
other one sold also
and at essentially the
exact same price. So
the whole notion is you
want something out
there that does what an
economist would call
price discovery. And
once there is price
discovery, then
transactions can resume.
So that's why you're
saying once this auction
is done, then maybe
the market will function
on its own. It's like
you're saying that the
machine still works. It's
just sort of out of
oil and the pump
just needs to be primed.
Well, markets have been
used for thousands of
years. It's not that
suddenly in 2008
markets have permanently
ceased to operate. It's
a matter that the
situation among
financial institutions as
well as the situation
among mortgage holders,
that is the house owners,
is bad right now. And
that has resulted in
the market shutting down.
It's not going to be a
permanent phenomenon. And
the better the market
could unfreeze, the
better we'll all be.
In other words, these
things are worth
something, right? And
anything that's worth
something, there ought to
be someone willing to
like bet it's a little
more or a little less
and you have some
market for being traded,
right? You're saying
what has it seized up
is this is real
uncertainty.
Yeah. So these are
securities that are
certainly worth an
appreciable amount.
Perhaps they're worth
60 cents on the dollar,
but nobody really knows
what they're worth.
So why isn't the market
solving this, though?
You think there's someone
to be out there.
They have their model
and they say, I think
it's worth that.
I'll buy it from you.
You know, like, why
isn't it happening
right now?
They're all terrified
to buy and they
don't know what price
to pay.
Now I have to say not
everyone agrees that
the auction will
unstick the market
for mortgage-backed
securities. I was
talking to Eric
Maskin, who's a
Nobel Prize winner in
this particular area.
He's at Princeton's
Institute for Advanced
Study, and he says
that it's possible
that after the auction,
people will still
not want to
trade these things.
They still may have
very different ideas
of what the
mortgage-backed
securities they hold
are worth.
And in fact, he
says, it's possible
the stuff left
after the auction
may be the things
people disagree
about the most.
So he says, hard
as it is to believe
after the auction
there actually may be
less of a market
for trading these
mortgage-backed
securities.
Thanks, David Kestenbaum.
You know,
Planet Money's
David Kestenbaum
got a hard time
there for not being
an economist.
You know, he is,
no joke, a PhD
in particle
physics from Harvard.
He was on the team
that discovered
the top quark.
No, no dummy
are, David.
I'm blaming the top
quark for what's
going on in the
financial world
right now.
Dan Costello
joins us now.
Hey, Dan.
How you guys doing?
Very good.
Dan, you are
a former business
reporter with
the Los Angeles
Times. By former,
we mean until,
what, six weeks ago?
Until six weeks ago.
Yeah. And you
are heading off
to graduate school
at Columbia
here in New York.
And you've been a
fabulous blogger.
My wife in particular
is a huge fan.
Thank you very much.
All right.
So what are you up to, Dan?
So today we
we took a
question from a listener,
Jen Shelton,
who listens to us
on NPR station
in Texas.
And she wanted to know
something a lot of
people want to know.
Could she's great credit.
She bought our house
in 2001.
She pays her
mortgage on time,
but she wants to know,
could my mortgage
lender come and ask me
for my
what I own today
all at once?
And so
we've gotten that
from a bunch of people.
We decided to
try to find out.
Now, my gut sense
would be, no,
they can't just say,
give us all the money today
when they told you
you had 30 years
to pay it back.
But you checked it out.
We checked it out.
So we called a
a professor at Wharton
who was known
as the mortgage professor.
He's got a syndicated column.
You can also check him out at
mtgprofessor.com.
What's his name?
His name is
Jack Gutentag.
Jack, good day.
Good day.
Gutentag.
Well, it's not
it's not the kind of a question
that that I fielded
in a number of years,
but I've been getting
that question recently myself.
In some cases,
it's precipitated by something
the lender
might be selling the loan
that the borrow is loan.
And that generates anxiety
about what's going to happen
with the new lender.
And what you're describing
is this process
where the original lender
of many mortgages
in recent years
sold those mortgages
to other people.
And then they were
securitized into stocks
and held all around the world.
Yeah.
Well, sometimes
they were securitized.
Sometimes they weren't.
But the the borrow
will get a notice
at some point
that ownership of the loan
has been transferred.
And ordinarily, that's routine.
But in in the current
state of the world,
something like that
can trigger anxiety
because the borrower
wonders, well,
can the new lender
do something
that perhaps the other lender,
the original lender,
wouldn't do?
Some of the kind of problem
arises when they get a notice
that although the ownership
of the loan hasn't changed,
the servicing has changed.
The lender has engaged
someone else
to service the mortgage
and that that can
generate anxiety.
I got a letter this morning
from from someone
who had a loan
in good standing,
like the person
who wrote you, Dan.
He was worried about
whether or not
the lender could change
the index used
on his adjustable
rate mortgage.
He was worried
because some of the mortgages
of the type he has
use LIBOR,
which is the
rather than treasury.
And could you explain
what that is, LIBOR?
LIBOR is
is an acronym
that stands for the London
London Interbank
Offering Rate.
It's an interest rate
tied to the rate
that lenders charge
each other
on loans that they make.
And these were also
always viewed as very
low risk loans.
And the rate on them
was very close,
very closely aligned
to U.S. Treasury rates.
And many recently
many mortgages
and credit cards
and student loans
are tied to LIBOR.
So this is
the interest rate that
so this affects everybody.
It affects everybody
who has a loan
tied to LIBOR.
But this guy who wrote me
had his loan
tied to a treasury index
and was worried
about whether or not
it might be switched
to LIBOR
because LIBOR rates
have diverged sharply
from treasury rates recently.
Anyway, the answer
to all of these
questions is no.
Those those things
can't happen.
The borrower
who has a loan
in good standing
has a contract
and the lender,
no matter who it is,
and the servicing agent,
no matter who it is,
has to abide by that contract.
So they're not vulnerable
to a demand
to suddenly repay the loan.
They're not vulnerable
to a decision
by a lender
that the interest rate
is going to be raised.
And they're not vulnerable
to the lender
saying that they're going
to switch the index
from treasury to LIBOR
because that
is specified in the contract.
I mean, we are still
a nation under law
and the law of contract
still holds.
So that cannot be set aside
no matter what happens
to the lender.
Hey, Jack Gutentuck,
thank you very much for that.
And Jen Shelton,
don't worry, you're OK.
We'll link to his column
at NPR.org slash money.
So keep sending those
questions in through email, Twitter.
We actually have
a new Facebook group.
I'll throw that up
in this podcast blog entry.
You can always write to us
at planetmoney at NPR.org.
So we've got this
one last piece to play.
It started earlier today
when this guy, David Folkenflick,
he's NPR's media correspondent,
came running in and he goes,
you guys, you guys,
there's this panhandler outside
and you've just got to go meet him.
And we went down,
we found him on 42nd Street
just off Times Square.
He was sitting against a wall,
kind of an average looking guy,
you know, in his 30s,
sort of dirty blonde,
brown hair, scraggly with a beard.
He had your average
black duffel bag with him.
He had a black hat
in front of him.
And I'd say there's
maybe about three bucks,
maybe not even in coins
in front of it in the hat.
And he had with him a sign,
and that sign
did make this guy worth meeting.
My name is Ron Martin
and my sign says
I will be suspending
my panhandling campaign
so as to focus
on the national economy.
I don't think I think
the market is probably
the recipient
of most of the problem,
but I think we have enough people
in this country and globally
who are removed
from the stock market
who are going to
basically pull us through.
They're going to continue
to spend money and that'll
keep the economy going.
So what's the last money
you spent?
The last money I spent
probably on beer,
beer and chips.
What kind and how much?
No, I bought coffee
and coffee
and bagel this morning.
But beer,
I don't buy Budweiser anymore,
but I think I got Coors.
Do you remember how much it was?
Yeah, I get a good deal.
Got a dollar fifty for 24 ounce.
So how's the take today
or these days?
Have you noticed the difference?
It hasn't been too bad.
It's been pretty good.
I've gotten a couple of people
even buy the sign from me.
So make bigger money there.
Wait, you've actually sold
copies of this sign?
Yes, yes.
That's that's enterprise.
I got 20 bucks for the sign.
Hey, boss, happy new year.
Caitlin Kinney
took a great picture
of the guy, Ron Martin.
It's on our blog.
Thank you, Laura.
And thank you, Caitlin.
That's a wrap for Planet
Money for today.
We will be broadcasting
from my living room on Monday.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Well, it's Columbus Day.
I don't want to come
all the way in just to.
So I'm going to
I got all the equipment at home.
I can do it from there.
And we're going to bring you
all the news from the weekend.
OK.
Don't miss Ira Glass
and Alex Bloomberg's
special reporting on
This American Life this weekend
from Chicago Public Radio.
And watch our blog.
We'll be updating that all weekend.

I don’t think too many people on Wall Street listen to the president to carefully today’s Friday, October 10. It is 5:37 PM here in New York. Yeah I remember watching a Twitter crowd today were twitter.com/planet money and they’ve spent the day watching the Dow swing around it looks like it doesn’t know which way is up down north south can you please tell them what is going on well honestly I wish I could I hate today for some reason this was the day I liked the least families of all been overwhelming, confusing frustrating days but they’ve been kind of exciting and at most days there’s some thing of a clear narrative, the narrative my change day today  Just confusing me the Dow I get was happening to four so I’m gonna creeks way back up above where it opened seem to be doing at the moment and was saying that she thought it was just rumors of this and that what is it the seven might do something this week yeah, I’ve been hearing rumors all day long huge from older US governments about the bill at Morgan Stanley the US government is about to start buying tons of banks all over the country the G7 and the seven big industrialized nations were meeting in Washington this week to finance minister  to this week they’re going to have some big decision. None of it has come to pass so far lol who knows by the time you listening to this podcast maybe on the stuff we don’t yeah in one hour we’re gonna hear from Henry Paulson it might be a boring old press conference with the seven remake say we’re moving off of money and moving to a Garden in Soekarno shelf. Whatever it is, you’ll find it here at npr.org/money will be following it even after we publish this podcast, and if you wanna know mortal deafly gonna block npr.org/money yeah, the other thing I’ve been getting from leaders all the time is a question about Fannie Mae Freddie Mac, and comes in different forms  Out there listening to John McCain and Barack Obama bat all over the campaign trail and this weekend. Our friends over this American life are partners really deep diving into the financial crisis again and you can hear the full show from PRI on public radio stations all over the country in the clip I’m just about to preview for you. I have a glass with another friend of ours, Charles Duhigg of the New York Times  a serious serious guy. He’s broken major views about Fannie and Freddie all year and I don’t necessarily get Fannie and Freddie all the way, but Charles Duhigg does you’ve probably heard by now in the last two years, the mortgage industry and then I’ll kinds of supreme mortgages, headed to hotspots novel kinds of mortgage, back securities album in the world Konomi  Spotify I’m going to politics Bob this last week on a radio show. We debunked an idea here a lot of Democrats these days Tiur Leon Republicans today we could go look at the other side of the aisle right into a point of republican dogma Democrats on Wednesday of this past week I attended anything Pennsylvania and I was amazed that nearly every person I talk to this Republican crowd was quite certain who is the culprit to work  Liberal Democrat in the house encourage in support of the notion that banks should should be providing loans to people who couldn’t afford them in inner-city wherever they saw the McCain regulations and they refuse to do anything about it. Boni Frank said no it’s OK no problem is it’s running great and here we are today , it’ll melt into thousand five Republicans to the prevented a lot of the mess that right now with a try to regulate with a try to fix it for the Democrats stop and a key to the whole crisis they say is the mortgage companies Freddie Mac Fannie Mae is a Fannie and Freddie at the center of the whole thing is John McCain at second president of the day  This fire was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I bet you may never even heard of them before this, but you know they are the ones that with the Encouragement Center, Obama and his cronies in Washington afford to pay back question did the sub time crisis start with Danny absolutely not is the prime rate crisis did not start with is Charles Duhigg  pi to the Septi prices for the New York Times. He says it was not family and 39 but Walsky international investors brokers, thanks created and popularized subprime mortgages penny. Freddy didn’t get involved and seriously this huge surprise economy. Wall Street came in and they said we’re gonna basically by anyone anyone can make in Freddy  if that points for worse and worse, and that intern further fuels the growth of person so it started out as a kind of small brushfire that was worrisome was fanned overtime into a huge huge blaze and pinion Freddy horn in Porten part, but they didn’t create. They weren’t the single greatest input. They were part of the problem, unless allowed to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back in 2005 as they want it , I was the one I was the one who calls at the time for title restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I’m happening in the first place in the center Obama was silent on the regulation, a Fannie, Mae and Freddie Mac and his Democratic Congress pause every effort to rain the men what are they talking about? What what did Republicans try to do a couple of years ago so in 2005 a couple of Republicans introduced legislation that would place greater restrictions  Howard the regulator to basically have a tiger holder. Now it’s important to give me mine is John McCain didn’t actually sponsor that legislation. Initially, he came to it kind of your months and months after his been introduced in after being reported, come out send Fania for your terrible come, and everyone was kind of jumping on a John McCain, jumped on  if people have interviewed him in the Senate I said to John McCain was never a big deal, but if you want Fania Freddy, but he did cosponsor legislation deserve some some credit for that did you thousand five legislation to things personal would’ve cut the number of loans that anybody can hold for themselves so it would’ve avoided part of the problem. The Freddy is happening right now in theoretically, it might have caused Fannie Freddie to stop buying so many risky lungs, but that’s not a guarantee. In fact, it would’ve been completely up to the regulator, and the regulator who’s holding the position right now is the name of James Lockhart in the past year  in the past year he actually helped anybody buy more and more risky airlines because Congress over the past year started asking anybody to buy whiskey ones because I thought that would help McConnell right now it’s a part of a Republican orthodoxy. It seems that that if we had fixed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2005, we wouldn’t be in the crisis rain today  is that true that’s actually not true so if we fixed handyman Freddie Mac in 2005, the prices might be different, and it might be slightly less, but the crisis would absolutely still be here at circle talking point is is on the question of who associated with it considered, McCain said  he might have advised Samator Obama executors a Fannie, Mae, and Freddie Mac of advised him, and he’s taking their money for his campaign back. He’s receive more money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and any other senator in history with the exception of the chairman of the committee overseeing an ad Lincoln, Barack Obama to Nl executive at  Franklin rate for advice on mortgage under extensive financial phone range made millions Barack Obama Franklin reign which is based on. Apparently Barack Obama and Franklin reigns once bumped into each other and ever get together. It went Barack Obama had one conversation very briefly once so it’s a little disingenuous to say that Franklin rangers advisor to Barack Obama know that , he said, did you find a money tree if you want to say who’s taking less or more money from Barack Obama it is absolutely true is the second highest recipient of logging dollars from Fannie Mae and Budi you’re the reason why with John Makena saying is a little disingenuous is because his campaign manager, John McCain‘s campaign manager again and Rick Davis was a lobbyist for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and took over $2 million from them in logging fees it to run this group to bed, put together to try and fight back against more  Regulation and in fact all those other Rick Davis left his firm when your joints in the king campaign, his firm that he still owns a pardon, was receiving payments from Freddie Mac until earlier this year, right yeah yeah I think it I think it ended in August and August done I’m not certain exactly the date. In fact, I work on the story of breaking up and what they said the reason why family and Freddie Mac are paying Rick Davis, Jonathan campaign manager, because I want to access to John McCain. They thought that maybe you can come president Sunday  Would be good to be friends with a guy who’s one of his closest eight general transferred. It says it’s true that Republicans have tried to rain in years and it’s true that in general Democrats go to Danny ready to take on mobile airlines and push through spending low interest rates go to the house and grow and sausage  Through the Republicans pot regulation of financial markets. This is none of that. It’s the overall trip to say that either party hat, great foresight is completely untrue. Both parties deserve a great deal of blame for what happened with the prince and the tramp in the blame on one party or the other really much is the issue a crisis like what’s going on right now? Can’t develop without everyone if you mean we’re looking at , the biggest crisis in a century that only happens when basically everyone drops the ball so there’s enough blame to give to both parties when it comes down to specific individuals some individuals deserve a lot more claim and others couple weeks talking to people who are especially good or especially bad with Barack Obama and John McCain either of them especially great especially careful. No Barack Obama cares about a whole bunch of other things then , John McCain cares about a whole bunch of things besides 10 minutes spent most of their careers talking about things besides Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc. a big issue for them. Thanks so much to Ira glass and art good friends and partners of Chicago Public radio is this American life here that show all weekend long on public radio international stations near you go to dislike.org. Thanks also to Charles Doohickey , also a good buddy Haris he’s over at the New York Times know of the other thing we can hang a lot of attention to behind the scenes we haven’t talked as much about on the podcast is the exact mechanism how the US government is going to buy these troubled asset toxic waste of this treasury department is gonna spend $700 billion on. How would we not a garage sale? It’s not a garage sale  in from the garage sailing away as a David Kebon Mal Adam found out he talk to one of the guys who is on the forefront of creating the kind of auction that the government is going to use is it just by having the auction will actually start trading these toxic mortgage back securities again say that did not make a lot of sense to me. I had a long discussion with Larry, awesome bell University of Maryland. He’s working on design for the auction and he gave me this example of a tiny market that was stuck  in Boston personally it was because no one knew what things were worth and then it got unstuck and I know this isn’t really relevant but I have to tell you that Larry Asavela has this excellent big walrus mustache suppose you want to hat suppose that there are 20 houses for sale in your neighborhood and none of them have sold in the past year. What’s your house worth  Know any good ways of doing an assessment of it no no anyways of appraising it if there are 20 for sale and no transactions are occurring yeah OK kk out of the bricks and Ecy like it’s on the bricks there you go that’s why you’re not in the car where are we to continue the analogy little bit more and I moved to Washington yes, the last hit in the real estate  The house that we ended up buying it was one of two houses on a short live both of which have been on the market for over a year but perfectly lovely houses but both at asking prices of a really unrealistic and we wanted one of them, and we made with the seller Shirley to use as a really Loboa her at all  With a lot lower than what they wanted. We bought the house and a few weeks later the other ones sold also another essentially exact same price. The whole motion is he wants something out there that does verdant Hannah basketball price discovery and once there is a price discovery then that’s why you’re saying once this auction is done then maybe the market will functional it’s like you’re saying that that even machine still works at Welly  Market something used for thousands of years it’s not the suddenly in 2008 markets of Permanente sister operate. It’s a manner that the situation among us as well of the situation among Morgan’s holders is bad right now and that has resulted in the market, setting that it’s not going to be a permanent phenomenon and the better the market could unfreeze the better little bit  Are worth something right anything it’s worth something they’re all to be someone’s going to the market for being treated right using what is the sun is real on yeah so that serve you are securities that are certainly worth and appreciative of that. Perhaps they’re worth $.60 on the dollar but nobody really knows what they’re worth. Why isn’t the market to be out there they have the model , they’re all terrified to buy. They don’t know what price to pay and I have to say not. Everyone agrees that the auction will unstick the market for mortgage back securities. I was talking to Eric mask and it was a Nobel prize winner in this particular area study and he says that it’s possible that after the auction people will still not want to trade these things they still may have very different ideas of what the mortgage back securities stay home are worth and in fact, he says it’s possible to step left after the auction may be the things people disagree about the most so he says hard as it is to believe after the auction they’re actually making less of a market for trading these out mortgage back securities. Thanks, David Kebon, YouTube  Planet money is David customer get a hard time there for nothing. He is a PhD in particle physics from Harvard is on the team to discover the top 10 Costello joins us now a good damn you are a former business reporter with the Los Angeles times yet and you are heading off to graduate school at Columbia here in New York and you’ve been a fabulous blogger my wife , so what are you up again? So today we took a question from Elizabeth Jen Shelton, NPR station in Texas and she wanted to know something luck could credit time with my mortgage in a common ask me for money today all at once so no Mika thatfill The know they can’t just say give us all the money today when I talk to you , but check it out. We checked it out so we call Diah professor at Wharton known as the mortgage professor mtgprofessor.com‘s name is Jack Jack. Good day well, it is not in a number of years but I’ve been getting that question recently myself, precipitated by something the lender might be selling the loan that the bar was low and that generates the anxiety about what should happen with the new lead and what you’re describing is this process where it is the original lender of many Mortgages  Sold those mortgages to other people and then they were securitize into stocks and held all around the world. Yeah, the time they weren’t the borrow it will get a notice at some point that ownership of the loan has been transferred and would never leave that routine but in a in the current state of the world, something like that can trigger anxiety because the borrower wonders well and the new lender to  or something that perhaps the other lender the original lender wouldn’t do a problem arises when they get a notice that although the ownership of the loan hasn’t changed, the lender has engaged someone else in and that generates anxiety I got a letter this morning from from someone who had a loan  Standing like who wrote you down he was worried about whether or not the lender could change the index adjustable rate mortgage. He was worried because he has use LIBOR, which is the treasury and computers thing with that is that I bought at LIBOR is the London, London interbank, offering raiders tied to the rate that other on loans that they make the whole wage , Udas is very low risk realign and many many mortgages, and credit cards and student loans are tied to LIBOR is the interest rate that affects everything everybody who has a loan guy who wrote me at his loan, and was worried about whether or not it might be the light or because the LIBOR rate of diverged  Anyway, the questions is no shit happen the the borrower who has a loan in good standing as a contract and the lender, no matter who it is no matter who it is tied by the country so they’re not vulnerable to with a man alone do not vulnerable to a decision by a lender that is going to be rich raise  to the lender saying that they from treasury to LIBOR because it bad I mean we are still a nation under law and the law of contract so shut the side no matter what happens to the lender. Hey yo Nl Jog Shelton, don’t worry you’re OK willing to his column at npr.org  is in through email Twitter Facebook group I’ll throw that up in this podcast block.

What is Ron Martin in my sign says I will be spending my panty when camping so as to focus on the national economy, I don’t think I think the market is probably the , most of the problem but I think we have enough people in this country globally who are new from the stock market who are going to basically pull us money, so what’s the last money you spent the last money I spent probably on beer, beer and chips what kind?
