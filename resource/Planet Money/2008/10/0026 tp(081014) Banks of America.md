Federal officials today announced they were using the $700 billion bailout to buy shares in banks. The idea is to get money into them quickly so they can start lending money again. It's a big idea — and a smart one, many economists say — but the devil is in the details. We hear one of the earliest objections.

**(Laura Conaway):**


Today, I am announcing that the Treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of
banks and thrifts.
Government owning a stake in any private U.S. company is objectionable to most Americans,
be included.
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
Today is Tuesday, October 14th.
It's about 4.32 p.m.
Adam, what's going on out there?
Well, we just heard Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson make today's major announcement.
As we have reported here many times, the American taxpayers are now going to be buying
into banks.
They're going to be buying shares, whether we want to or not.
And does the market like it?
Well, the Dow seemed to like it.
The stock market seemed to like it.
And then they seemed to not like it quite as much.
The Dow went way up and then it fell down.
The Dow doesn't know.
The credit markets are not impressed as of yet.
As you know, we here at Planet Money, I guess today we are officially instituting the Planet
Money indicators.
These are things we've talked about before, but we're calling them the Planet Money indicators.
The TED spread, which we've talked about a lot, it is still above 4, a huge number.
It's at 436 basis points, that means 4.36.
That is down a little.
It went down about 4.5% from yesterday, but it's still way, way, way in the stratosphere
compared to historic norms.
So the TED spread is not doing terribly well.
LIBOR also remains high.
And the three-month treasury bond, I actually just had that up and I've lost it, but
it was very low, which is bad.
Remember, if treasury bonds are low, three months are yielding 0.12.
Today they're 0.11, but even last week when things were crazy bad, they were 0.67.
So it's fallen.
With treasury bonds, the lower it is, the worse things are.
With TED spread, the higher it is, the worse things are.
And both of them are in the worst things are area.
But another way to find out what's going on is to call the front lines of the
credit crisis.
And we called up, I think we can say our favorite money trader.
You could be our pet money trader.
Here's our pet money trader.
Bill Aston-Rees with the flowing blonde locks.
That's actually true.
He really does have flowing blonde locks.
They're good for radio.
Of tradition, Agile Securities in New York.
He says that he wouldn't read too much into the bad news today because people are
trying to figure out what this plan is.
There's a lot of noise that has to be sorted through.
And until people can get some definitive answers, there's really not going to be
a lot of movement.
One of the phrases that you've used in asking me is, have we seen any cracks in
the ice yet?
No, we haven't.
There were no cracks in the ice here.
No trades.
No.
Nothing.
And you're just, there's just not any money moving through your desk.
No, not at all.
And another thing that you got to keep in mind, Adam and Laura, is that it's
one thing for the government to say these measures have freed up lending.
In other words, lending should be able to begin unabated.
It's another thing to actually have cash on hand to lend.
This is a credit crisis.
It's also a liquidity crisis.
So again, it's one thing to say, OK, feel free to invest in banks or to
lend to banks.
It's another thing for that money to actually be there to be invested into
the banks.
Gotcha.
And so I'm picturing you've got clients, there's all sorts of money
market funds and banks who have teams of lawyers and accountants just
drilling through all these plans, trying to figure out what's going on.
Risk managers, yeah.
Risk managers before they actually.
But the hope is it's possible that tomorrow or the next day, the
conclusion will be, hey, it is OK, we're going to start lending again.
I think you're going to see a trickle before you see any kind of sustained
stream.
I don't think it's just I don't think it's going to be like throwing a
light switch or all of a sudden the lights on.
I think it's going to be more like slowly opening the spigot if and
when it occurs.
And I'm not saying I'm remaining very agnostic about this plan.
That's assuming that these people, their plan achieves its best
case scenario.
That's assuming that it achieves its best case scenario.
Even if it achieves its best case scenario, it's still just a trickle.
It's going to start as a trickle before it becomes a steady stream.
So it sounds like no daylight yet for trader Will Aston Reese.
Not yet for him.
We wanted to figure out for ourselves what is in this big plan.
We wanted to do what he's doing.
We wanted to figure out what's going on in this plan.
The there's this big idea of making a capital injection, this stock
injection, where it's a fancy way of saying the government gives money
to banks and in return they get shares in those banks.
And it's very different from how the bailout was originally sold.
That original Paulson plan and even the modified plan that the Senate
and the House finally passed, the original idea was to use that
$700 billion to buy up all those bad mortgages and other toxic assets.
Now at least a chunk of this money is going directly to sort of
semi-nationalize the banks.
This guy, Christopher Carroll, is a professor of economics at
Johns Hopkins.
He says that he thinks that the stock injection is a good idea,
and he says we've turned a corner.
Christopher, if I understand right, you're saying today,
Tuesday, October 14th, we've finally figured it out.
We've solved the problem.
I think the fever is broken and we are on a path that's going
to end up being OK.
And what broke the fever?
It's this announcement this morning that the government is going to
buy shares in banks.
That's right.
I think that coming up with a credible plan that will actually
address the key problem, which was the banks were short on money,
short on capital, instead of addressing the sort of what looked
like a problem but wasn't really at the root of everything,
which was this toxic assets problem.
You were one of, I would think, a majority of economists who
wanted this to happen even before it was part of the plan.
Can you explain why you wanted this to happen and why you were
disappointed that it wasn't?
And then let's get to what did happen.
Well, it was never clear to me, or I think anybody else,
how purchases of the sort of what we call the toxic assets
would really do anything to fix the problems that we were in.
And it looked like it might be a terrible deal for the taxpayer.
So if it doesn't fix the problem and is a ripoff,
that's not really a plan that one can be enthusiastic about.
The real problem was that the banks were short on money,
short on capital to lend to people in firms.
And so you needed to get capital directly into the banks
and not use it to buy these toxic assets.
So you wanted this stock injection plan
from the beginning.
Like I keep saying, a majority, not every economist,
but a majority of the economists I've spoken to and read,
I would say, supported the stock injection plan.
And just quickly lay that out in the abstract.
What is a stock injection plan?
Well, it's a plan, basically, where
the government comes to a bank that's in trouble
and says, here's the deal.
You need money.
We have money.
We're going to get something in exchange for it.
We're going to get an ownership stake in your bank.
And we're going to sort of sit on your back
until you pay us off.
And that gives you the incentive
to do a good job and sort of make some money
so you can pay us off and get back to your normal business.
And that's a lot better than just going to the bank
and saying, you have some nasty stuff
that you would like us to overpay you for,
then just dump it on us, which was the original plan.
And then go about your business.
When the plan first came forward
and the idea was to buy up the toxic waste
off the bank's balance sheets,
the number $700 billion was attached to it.
And they said, well, this is what we think will do it.
We're now down to Treasury having easy access to $350 billion.
Do you think that's enough money to do this, to make it work?
That's a good question. It may not be.
They are trying to structure the plan
in a way that will encourage private investors
to get in on the game, like Warren Buffett did
when he took a stake in Goldman Sachs.
In fact, what the government is doing
with respect to the financial sector as a whole
is actually quite similar to what Warren Buffett did
with his investment in Goldman.
And that's a reassuring thing,
ought to be a reassuring thing
to all the taxpayers out there
because Warren Buffett was looking to make some money
from his investment in Goldman.
And so I think we can hope that the taxpayer
might ultimately end up doing okay.
So what you're saying is,
ignore what the president says,
ignore what the Treasury Secretary
and the Fed Chairman say.
If Warren Buffett is for it,
then that shows it's probably a good idea.
Yes, well, the president frankly
doesn't have much credibility
and neither does the Treasury Secretary anymore.
But Warren Buffett, we know he's a smart guy
and an out to make a buck.
So if we're doing the same thing he was doing,
then probably we're on the right track.
And that's the basic idea here is we, what we own,
I mean, it looks like we'll also buy toxic waste,
but right now what we own is shares in banks.
If those banks do better, our shares do better,
we as taxpayers get more money back.
With the toxic assets,
we own the thing that nobody on earth wants right now.
There are a variety of ways
where you could conceive of it increasing in value
and us getting money back,
but it seems to me that most people who look at it
think there's a pretty safe bet
we're gonna lose money on that.
Right.
Whereas with the banks, at least we have a shot
or do you think we'll definitely make money?
I think there's a very good chance we will make money
partly because this plan is structured
around the idea of making the banks sufficiently attractive
to try to lure in private investors as well.
And the private investors like Warren Buffett
are only gonna be lured in
if they think they're gonna make money.
And so if the private investors do pile in,
at least that's a vote of confidence
that they think they're gonna make money.
Thank you to Christopher Carroll of Johns Hopkins.
We put a link to his blog on our site, npr.org slash money.
Can I just say, Adam,
that every time I hear stock injection
or capital injection,
I think of the needle scene in Pulp Fiction.
Wow.
That's kind of what it is.
Actually, that's a really good point
because like Uma Thurman,
the banking system was dead
and the government came along
with a massive hypodermic needle,
shoved it in the chest and pumped it.
We're still in that moment in the movie
where we don't quite know if it worked yet.
The banking system has not jumped up
and gasped itself back to life.
Yeah, and Professor Carroll,
he seems kind of optimistic about it,
but then we talked to this other guy,
Anil Kashyap of the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business,
and he found the devil hanging out in the details.
Well, it's a good start,
and I certainly would be in the list
if I'd have been saying
they need to recapitalize the banks,
but the key thing is whether or not
this plan as it's set up
is definitely going to do that,
and that's where unfortunately the details matter a lot.
So two of the provisions that I believe are correct
about this plan are,
first of all, there's no restrictions
on the ability of these banks
that have received the support
from paying dividends,
provided they've made the dividend payments
that they promised the government.
Wait, so what you're saying is,
if there's no limit on how much they can give,
a dividend, and here at Planet Money,
we try and deal with the deep issues,
but we also try and cut through the jargon
for people who aren't as familiar.
A dividend basically means you own a stock,
and once a quarter or twice a year or whatever,
you get some money as a payment.
The company is sharing their profits
with the people who own the company.
Yes, and dividends can only be paid
after you've paid all the bank loans
and other debt that you've borrowed.
And so you would like to see a limit on what,
because basically what, am I right here,
that by having an uncapped dividend,
a bank could take, say, $10 billion
from the US government, from us, from the taxpayer,
and after getting a little bit healthier,
basically give that $10 billion
to the owners of the bank.
Yeah, there's some restrictions.
I mean, they have to at least pay back
the dividend that they promised the government.
The condition of the 10 million or billion going in
is that they have to pay certain interest
on that back to the government.
But after that, there's no prohibition
on paying out additional monies
to the current shareholders.
So that undermines my principle
of maximizing the capital that remains in the banks,
because if they don't hang on to the money,
their ability to resume lending
and get the economy going again is gonna be limited.
The existing shareholders may have different interests
than the government, you and I,
in seeing these banks revived.
So why would, I mean, a bank wants to be recapitalized.
Why would they?
A bank wants to maximize the return
for the existing shareholders.
And so if they've just been handed a big pile of money
and they can essentially divert it
to the existing owners,
then that may be tempting.
So I'm feeling my blood boiling here a little.
Yeah, I'm wondering why they would do it this way.
Why would the government set this up like this?
Well, I mean, you'll have to ask the government
why there weren't restrictions on dividends.
Most of us that were pushing for recapitalization
just presume that there were gonna be
really sharp restrictions on the ability
to pay out any money to the existing owners.
I'm not saying that this should be indefinite
or anything like that,
but there should definitely be some sort of mandate
that they have to get back
to where they're very, very well capitalized.
Maybe paying back the money
that they've borrowed from the government
or starting on a path to doing that
before they start returning money
to the existing equity holders.
Wow, all right, so we're gonna pay a lot of attention.
And Anil, when you get back from your trip to Europe,
I'd love to check in with you on that
because I'm gonna make that a planet money priority
is really monitoring that.
Well, you should check too
about exactly what the rules on repurchasing shares
because that's another way
that you can return money to the existing owners.
You said there were two things you didn't like.
Is that the second thing you don't?
Yeah, that's the second.
The repurchase restrictions, if I understand correctly,
are a little bit more onerous.
They can only do it in keeping with the patterns
that they'd already established.
Anil, I'm gonna cut you off there.
I just wanna explain.
Repurchasing means, so let's say I have a car company
and I have 1,000 shares in my company out there
and each one is worth $100.
So I have $100,000 in capital.
What I could do if I make a lot of money
and I have cash in the bank
is I could buy 500 shares from the public
and basically repatriate it back to my company.
And that effectively raises the,
that's a benefit to the existing shareholders
who keep their stock, right?
Their stock value goes up
because it diminishes the number of outstanding shares
and so each share is worth more.
Yeah, the number of ways
that the pie has to be split falls.
So the people that sell either get the money then
or you get a claim that's shared with fewer people.
So one way or the other, you're better off.
And so that's another thing they could do.
So one thing they could do
is take the billions of dollars the US taxpayer gives them
and give it, just directly give it to their shareholders.
The other way is they could take that money,
use it to buy stock
and then the shareholders who didn't sell their stock
have basically received a free gift from the taxpayer
by having what they own increase in value.
Right, so these are basically ways
that the government money,
instead of going in to kind of build up
the risk-bearing capacity of the bank
could get diverted towards just rewarding the current owners
and that's not the point
of what the equity injection was supposed to be about.
Now I'm reasonably confident
that the vast majority of people
who are gonna hear this conversation
are gonna say this is outrageous.
This makes me wish they hadn't done this.
Are you there,
do you wish they had just not done this deal
at this plan at all
or do you feel like with its flaws,
it's still better than not having this?
There are other details that we still don't know about
but look, I think the banking crisis,
the banking crisis had reached a new stage
and they had to try to recapitalize the banks
but if you've got a bank
that ends up having got this money
and it's gonna turn out to be inadequate
and then they're on the road to failing,
there may be this temptation to pay the money out.
One last thing,
we did talk to one economist today who said,
all right, he thinks this is,
we're turning the corner,
things are gonna start improving.
What do you think?
I think the alternative of not doing anything
would have been completely disastrous
so we're certainly gonna have stabilized things for a bit.
Now we're gonna have to see.
I'd hate to be a one note Johnny
but if they don't actually recapitalize the banks
then this isn't gonna turn the corner.
You know, if it turns out
that you need more than the 125 billion
and that they're gonna have to go out
and get further private money
and they can't figure out incentives to make that happen
then we're gonna be back in trouble,
not next week, maybe not next month
but down the line.
So Laura, today was gonna be the first podcast
that was gonna be positive.
It would be the first time since we started Planet Money
that we would actually have lots of good news to report.
I felt kinda lost about that really.
Yeah, well, you should feel glad
that Anil Kashyap from the University of Chicago
brought us down to earth with a little bit of pessimism.
So thank you Anil Kashyap.
Plenty of money listeners, we just wanna tell you
we're gonna keep digging into the details of this plan.
We just wanna make sure it's clear to us
and to everybody else how the government
is gonna spend that money
and what exactly Americans are gonna get out of it.
We also thought it'd be worth getting a broader view
at how the U.S. government is changing.
So we sat down with economist Brad Setzer.
He's with the Council on Foreign Relations.
He talked with me and Alex Bloomberg
in a story that also airs on this American life.
Here's how the U.S. government usually behaves.
It borrows money in the form of selling treasury bonds
and then it spends that money on stuff for the country.
Blackhawk helicopters or cancer research,
occasional bridge to nowhere, stuff in the budget.
But with the passage of the bailout bill,
it's gonna be doing something
entirely different with that money.
It's gonna be buying up mortgage-related assets
from banks and that's not all.
Just this week, it announced it would start
lending the money it raises
directly to individual companies
in something called the commercial paper market.
Brad Setzer is an economist
at the Council on Foreign Relations
at the Treasury Department.
NPR's Adam Davidson and I sat down with him
a couple of days ago and he told us
that by doing all these new things,
the United States has started acting
like something completely different than a government.
It's starting to act like a bank.
It is borrowing money by selling these
short-term treasuries and lending to the banking system
and lending to firms like GE and others
that are big players in the commercial paper market.
So instead of borrowing money and then building a bridge
you know, somebody's Medicaid bill,
it is borrowing money and then investing it,
giving it to a company as a loan
that will be paid back or something like that.
That's the big change that happened today.
And then in addition to doing all that,
there's the 700 billion that's gonna be used to buy
assets that are harder to value and harder to sell
and in that, it is acting like,
also acting like a bank or an investment bank
but it's not acting completely like a bank
because if it was acting completely like a bank,
it would be trying to drive the hardest possible bargain
so it can make the most money.
The US government doesn't want to do that
because making the most possible money means in effect
buying these assets at the lowest prices possible
and there's a problem with that.
The problem is that if you drive too hard of a bargain,
if you're doing this as a pure financial bet,
sort of go for the kill,
get them at the lowest possible price,
the banks are bust.
So it's acting like a really badly run bank.
It's like, well, nobody else will pay you more than,
you know, 20 cents on the dollar for those things
but we'll give you 40 cents.
Yes, but it's doing so for a reason.
No, absolutely.
Which is that if the banks had to sell at 20 cents,
they're bust.
Right, right, right.
And I'm not saying that it shouldn't be doing that,
it's just that the US government is in this position
that it's not normally in
which is to try to behave half like a business
and half like a government.
But this is what, I mean, you all are shocked.
I used to work on emerging economies.
This is what happens when you have a really bad crisis.
This is what happens when the banking system
is on the edge of collapse.
So it's just that you, this has happened before,
it just hasn't happened to the US before.
Exactly.
Where has it happened?
Indonesia, Thailand, Argentina, Russia.
And not surprisingly, in all those countries,
there are political consequences to the economic turmoil.
It's generally not good for any political system
if your banks come close to collapsing.
But it's not a good thing.
So I just don't know how to feel.
Should we be very upset that they're doing this
or should we be upset that the situation
require them to do it but glad that they're doing it?
I think you should be upset
that the situation got to this point
but glad that there is an actor,
namely the US government,
that is still in a position to do this.
The US government still has the ability to borrow
and because it still has the ability to borrow,
it can provide support for the banking system
and the broader financial system
and prevent what otherwise
could have been a catastrophic run.
Because in some of these other countries,
the US government is right now in a position
where they can borrow money essentially for free
at very, very low interest rates at 0.1%.
Which is the...
That's the exact opposite of generally what happens
when other crises happen in other countries, right?
Their borrowing costs go way up.
Either they have to pay exorbitant interest rates
to borrow in their own currency
or they can only borrow in someone else's currency
which means that you're taking on even more risk.
So is there a limit to how much money
the US government can borrow?
Like if they have to borrow another $700 billion
in a month and another $700 billion in a month
after that, can they do it?
Possibly.
In some sense, it depends on how much anxiety
and fear there is.
Because the more anxiety and fear there is,
the more money is leaving the banking system,
leaving money markets,
and the more money that's going into treasury bonds.
So the more fearful everybody else is,
the easier it is for the US government to borrow.
In other words, people are saying,
I don't want to put my money in stocks
that are plunging or in bonds of companies
that might go out of business
or in any country that doesn't happen
to have the most powerful economy on the earth.
No, I want my money in the one safe place
I can think to put it, US treasuries.
And this is another way the US government
is different from a typical business.
The more it screws things up,
the more it mismanages its own economy,
the more people want to lend it money.
That was economist Brad Setzer
with Alex Bloomberg and me
for This American Life and Planet Money.
And that's a wrap for Planet Money today.
