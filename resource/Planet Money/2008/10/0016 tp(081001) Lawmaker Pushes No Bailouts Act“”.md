Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money podcast. I'm Laura Conaway. Today is Wednesday, October
1st, and it's about 522 p.m. in New York. The big news today hasn't happened yet. The
U.S. Senate plans to vote tonight on its version of the White House bailout bill.
It's still $700 billion, but now it's also tax breaks for businesses and certain individuals.
Let's just say it's got some sugar now. In just a minute we're going to hear from a member
of Congress who's floating a different bill. He calls it the No Bailouts Act. But first,
a question from a listener. Carl Noble is a doctor in the making. He's a med student
at the University of Ohio, and he's borrowing his way through school. I've been there,
but not quite under these circumstances. Well, I guess my main concern is, like
most people in the country, is about how these obviously huge economic problems are
going to affect my daily life. And for my number one concern is my student loans,
because med school costs a lot of money, and taking out $40,000 a year to finance my
education, I just want to know how that's going to affect me as far as interest rates,
whether I'm going to have trouble getting loans for my second through fourth year of
school. For an answer to Carl's question, we turn to Anya Kemenitz. She wrote a book
called Generation Debt, and she follows the student loan market really about as
closely as anyone. Anya? Over the summer, the talk of a credit crunch started in the
student loan market, and lenders started pulling out of the market, both for federal
student loans as well as private student loans, which are unsubsidized by the
federal government. So you mean a place where I used to be able to go and get a
student loan was no longer there? That's right. And particularly, it's very galling
because it happened at a lot of community colleges where they suddenly decided that
the entire student body was not a good risk anymore, and they cut off those types of
colleges, and students were finding out a month or so before school classes started.
It was scary, and it was upsetting. It remains a very small proportion of all the
lenders that are out there. There's about 111 lenders that have pulled out of the
program. That's as of a couple days ago. That's a lot of people. Well, it sounds
like a lot, but it's actually a pretty small percentage, particularly on a
portfolio basis. So, you know, Sallie Mae is still the behemoth of the
student loan industry. Chase, JP Morgan Chase, these large banks are not
pulling out of the program. They're very small lenders that have pulled out
of the program, and it's a small percentage overall of all loans. So
this guy in particular, his loans are with Chase, he says. Right. Chase and
Citibank and Sallie Mae have all announced that they have actually
increased their student loan portfolios with this credit crunch situation in
mind. So generally, it's not such a bad situation. Generally, there's not
really a credit crunch for student loans as much as it's been made out
to be. You have to recall that the federal government insures these loans
to the tune of about 95 cents on the dollar, so the risk for lenders is
not that great. What's the safest route to go for student loan borrowing?
Well, you know, I've always been a fan, and as you know, of the
direct loan program, because those funds come directly from the U.S.
Treasury, more or less, and so you have a built-in guarantee there,
and historically and increasingly in the future, there are more
borrower-friendly provisions within the direct loan program. So,
Carl, sounds like Anya Kamenetz, author of Generation Debt, says full
speed ahead. Now let's turn to Representative Peter DeFazio. DeFazio has
his own idea about how to save the nation's economy. He's a Democrat
from Oregon. He's pushing what he calls the No Bailouts Act. DeFazio
says he got a lot of his ideas from William Isaac. Isaac ran the
FDIC during the 1980s savings and loan crisis. I asked DeFazio about
his plan. This bill will require FDIC, that's the group that
insures bank deposits, to implement a net worth certificate program.
Tell me about that. Mr. Isaac used this very widely. He said for
almost 3,000 institutions he kept from going into government
receivership or going out of business during the savings loan
crisis. Basically, you send in a team of bank examiners. They
look at all the assets of the bank and they determine whether
this bank has any prospects of pulling out. So we still have,
it's the same thing. Some people didn't like Treasury Secretary
Paulson with the White House bill. They didn't like the idea
that he alone would essentially get to decide who lived and who
died. In this case, we have an agency who would look at banks
and make that. Exactly. Professionals who didn't work with
the firms that were affected in a competitive manner as when
he was head of Goldman Sachs. I mean, imagine if you were
a drinking buddy of Henry Paulson when he becomes God
with $700 billion to buy whatever he wants at whatever
terms he wants. If you're good friends, you're probably
popping champagne corks. If you're someone who made him mad,
you're like, oh, man, we are in trouble here.
Is this like FDIC insurance for an entire bank?
You could say that. It's perhaps a bit more complicated.
You might want to get Mr. Isaacs on. He actually can
explain these things fairly simply, but they are kind of
tough to grasp. This is about, you know, I've made
about 10 runs at this part of it.
That's thank you for making an 11th. Now, you say this
exchange provides short term capital without cash outlay.
Right, because the bank would be valued higher than its
current, you know, its current market value. But it would
have been done professionally. That means they suddenly
have capability of lending.
The number one step in your bill is that it would change
what's called mark to market accounting. Yes. Can you
explain for the average person in the coffee shop mark to
market?
Under current rules, a bank is only allowed to value its
assets at what they could sell them for today. So if
they have a portfolio of subprime loans, and 75% of
the people in that portfolio are paying their mortgage
every month, they still have to value that as a zero
value asset.
Because that's why everyone's saying this stuff is the
toxic waste that no one wants to buy.
Right. And this is, I think, a better way of doing it
because you don't take it from the banks and give it to the
taxpayers, which is what Paulson wants to do. Then you
have to then you have to go hire a whole bunch of people
from Wall Street to evaluate these things, hire a whole
bunch of people from Wall Street to manage these things,
hire a whole bunch of people on Wall Street to try
and someday sell these things. If you do this mark
to market within the institution itself, if you
would suspend that rule and allow the fair market value
accounting, again, there are rules for this. This isn't
fantasy stuff. You can't suddenly say, Oh, wait,
that's worth a billion. This this is hard headed stuff.
He says bank examiners do this every day and could do
this. This would not be people self declaring like
some of the people who took these mortgages who
self declared so called liar loans. We're not going
to have liar assets. But this would free up a
whole bunch of money in the system, according to
Mr. Isaac.
Can I say that back to you to make sure I understand?
So the bankers, in other words, would get a chance to
look at their portfolio. And instead of having to
say, well, it's worthless today, because no one will
buy it. They could they could describe what they
believe is a fair value for those assets,
given the income stream that they're providing.
Yes.
Okay, there's an awful lot of distrust these days
of bankers. Who's watching the bankers setting
down the value here,
the cops at the FDIC, the bank examiners is
the way Mr. Isaacs explained that this is not
done in a vacuum. And he said, and I said, boy,
you know, there's gonna be a lot of people in a
lot of banks. He said, does the FDIC have the
capability of doing this? He said, yes. He said,
we dealt with 3000 banks, savings and loans
during the savings and loan crisis.
How much would your plan cost?
Potentially nothing, because the FDIC, which
would be Federal Toys Insurance Corporation, and
their insurance would be on the hook here. And
the insurance is self funding. When they when
they get losses, they raise the fees on all the
member banks and we get paid back. I mean, the
government would have to upfront the money,
but ultimately gets paid back through the
insurance.
So in a worst case scenario, if the FDIC comes
in and makes bad bets, comes in and reads
banks as solvent that are in fact really on
the edge, the money for that payout for
covering that loss would come from money
raised from other banks.
That's correct.
Same as car insurance.
Yep. And so and and Mr. Paulson's premise is
take 700 billion, borrow it, buy up assets of
his choice at under terms of his choice,
unbelievable powers, he becomes the god of
Wall Street. Then, you know, this would
somehow take care of the problem. There's
some the question because we're talking
about freeing up commercial banks. He's
looking more at those firms that just last
week became commercial banks like Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the
investment houses on Wall Street.
And he could even be buying derivatives
under this bill, which I won't even begin
to try and understand or explain.
No one can understand some of them.
What's the near future for your bill?
Well, I'm working. I've got a dear
colleague out there to get co-sponsors.
I'm getting a number of Democrat
co-sponsors. I worked with two
Republicans to write it. But thus far
we're not. There's a lot of Republican
interest, but none have signed on yet.
So I'm not sure what's going on on
their side of the aisle. And I hope it
isn't, you know, an acceptance of the
Senate Paulson package with the tax
breaks added because there are some on
the other side of the aisle who just
think tax breaks solve every problem.
I don't.
Have you reached out to the Senate
about this yet?
I talked to a couple of senators about
it. Maria Cantwell was very
interested. I talked to Bernie Sanders
about it. But, you know, they're
going down a different path.
One of the things I think separates
your bill from some of the previous
conversation is that it really seems
to be about neither Wall Street nor
Main Street.
Yeah. No, I'm not pretending to
solve the Main Street problem.
Henry Paulson certainly isn't
solving the Main Street problem.
I'm saying if we borrow $700
billion and throw it at Wall
Street, that isn't going to solve
the Main Street problem.
If we don't borrow $700 billion
dollars and we want to help people
stay in their homes, establish
something like a homeowner lending
corporation like FDR had.
If we want to have real stimulus,
if we want to build
infrastructure, we want to put
people to work, we want to invest
in America, we'll still have some
borrowing capability left.
If we buy seven, borrow $700
billion dollars and throw it at
houses, the big houses on Wall
Street, who's going to lend us
the money to fix Main Street?

He’s a med student at the University of Ohio and he’s borrowing his way to school. I’ve been there, but not quite fond of the circumstances. Well, I guess I am a concern Is  in about how little Aldhita, Jog 9 probably gonna affect my daily life megalodon a lot of money and taking out the year that I have an agent gonna have trouble getting loans for my for an answer to Carl’s question we turned on the cabinets she wrote a book called generation debt, and she follows the student loan market really about as close as anyone Anya over the summer the talk of the credit crunch started  in a place where I used to be able to go and get a student loan was no longer there that’s right in the end it was scary and it was a setting of the remains a very out there. They said 111 I will be to go to a lot of people , so he knows he’s large guy right thing they have so generally it’s not such a bad situation. Generally there’s not really credit called out the federal government. What’s the safest route to go for a Sudirman Barat well, you know I want to the fan and I don’t know directly from my life and I do you have a building directly there if it’s directly, and there are more battery power , so Carl are you cabinets? Author of generation that says full speed ahead no, it’s turned a representative Peter DeFazio has his own idea about how to save a nation to Konomi. He’s a Democrat Oregon he’s pushing what he calls the no bail out at because you’re says he got a lot of his ideas from William Isaac Isaac ran the FDIC during the 1980 Savings and Loan crisis. I asked Defazio about his plan . This will require FDIC that’s the group that ensures bank deposit to implement a net worth certificate program. tell me about that Mr. Isaac 3000 examiners they look at all the assets of the bank and they determine whether the bank has any prospect of porn out so we still have. It’s the same thing some people didn’t like treasury secretary Paulson with the White House built I didn’t like the idea that the key alone with essentially get to decide who live in  Died. In this case we have an agency look at banks in the back like professional I didn’t work with the firm before affected if you were drinking buddy million dollars to buy what he want whenever you want and whatever Germany won if you’re a good friend problem is this like FDIC insurance for an entire bank of you could say that is probably a bit more complicated you might want to get  Explaining things fairly simply, but they are at the top of the graph. Thank you for making an 11th this exchange provide short term capital without cash outlay breakers the bank would be valued higher than its parent of current market value of but would’ve been done professionally that means it certainly have capability of lending. The number one step in your bill is that it would change what’s up  With Marc to market accounting yes can you explain for the average person to cover # to market current border bank is only allowed to value of them for today. They have a portfolio of the farm loan people that portfolio are paying your mortgage every month still have to value that as it because that’s what everyone saying no one wants to fuck right I think a better way if you don’t take it from the bank  Evaluation thing hire a whole bunch of people from all three payroll by the people in Mall III building thing. If you do this market market sell them that we would allow them fair market value accounting again this is hardheaded stop every day not the people self so-called liar lol , but this would free up a whole bunch of body. Can I say that back to make sure I understand so the bankers in other words would get a chance to look at their portfolio and instead of having to say it was worthless today because no one will buy it they could they could describe what they believe, is a fair value for those assets , off a lot of distress these days, a bakers who’s watching the bankers, setting down the value in the top of the FDIC. A lot of people are banks how much would your plane cost of potentially nothing because the FDIC which would be for corporation here when they have of the raise on all the member Bang , so in the worst case scenario, if the FDIC comes in and makes bad pets all of us that are in fact really on the edge, the money for that pay out for covering that loss come from money, recent other banks, or insurance info, and call Gillian borrow it by Upie F.H.
