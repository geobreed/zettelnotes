It’s 4:45 PM here in New York President Bush stock market has lost her than 1400 points in the last five sessions with 13% of its value that I love people been asking on the blog how they can follow the car and look at the stock market what part of the stock market and a Adam Davidson I  Have a Lotta at the credit market is the way to think about that. If the stock market is a place we can go in company you look fast borrow person by mortgage or a gigantic multinational corporation for million dollars wanna find out how much will cost to the bottom  of the reason I wanted to talk to Vinny is you had a post today that was just screaming the heat was just exactly something I have been saying all week you spell it out keep your eye on the credit market here every hour on the news Dow Jones collapse is 800 points father low 10,000 miles another 700 point we’re here that’s what we’re here all the time that’s got to be the most important information  it does matter but right now what really matters most is what’s going on in the credit market you’re saying that like every day people does the stock market I mean sure the day-to-day life that lives there in will be affected by whether or not this freeze bread, so and in the freezer  be if you were advising people don’t look at the Dow Jones. Here’s what you look at freaky and you’re saying you wanna look at two in the season in particular where are they now when I would look at the treasury bond rates are going up Nljog, which means Acmods Mario , and then I would look at what the rate is between the bank treasury. That is the secret secret gauge of how panic people with money are they gonna put it in a higher than yours OK so I’m I’m I’m in the bathroom and I’m getting up in the morning and I’m like , dang I go where do I go where you can go location so I go to Yahoo finance my typing tracker navigation bar and there will be a link to pay you more Bon OK and it’ll be on the market open it up and there’s a few more buns and Wala versus 0.35 yesterday is that  OK OK was a month ago so this is the higher number the higher the number is the calmer we can be, and so OK because generally the lower the treasury rate that means the more people the more investors are taking the money out of other things, like lending it to each other for everybody  Equality read read how good investment I may be how significant this rate was you’re ready 05% it was almost at 0% yield mean with US government could borrow money for three months and pay no interest affect. They have great wake up like in a week from now  on Yahoo finance in the treasury treasury at 0.00 0.0 portfolio take the Dow Jones thousand 10 to 10,000 great now you said there’s another number that’s one of the numbers and other numbers of using the like or not OK a little bit far is called or spread OK  Shuffle calculation minus OK OK and that that’s another measure of peace and if you want to come down because you want to see that there lending money to one another and you want to see come down and now by the way was right around everything else occurred. It was more like 1% , wow so higher in fear of money between banks money saying is like here’s the here’s the safest if I am at five alarm and put it back now the second safest place I can put my money is I can load it to another bank overnight. Thanks for lending to one another. What is my money is the treasury  if I can move it to another bank where my fellow banks overnight very next day there a bang what you’re saying right now is the rate that the government is charging is zero and the rate that is charging 4% from the fifth at 2% and anything OK so if you want to lend it out to another bank  JP Morgan bank Adam late I mean you know that’s where you can go and do a little bit more involved monitor work will give you an indication of better of investors put money into $700 million bond issue because of the money market conditions because they can’t get the money  to Mat Lansbury Schwarzenegger California the next 30 days money go to the market tomorrow like a toy company or an electronics how do you mean you don’t do that and then you’re going to big danger reason of when you can’t borrow money that beer to lend to anybody is that is this  All you have to do this will tell you whether or not the actions by the treasury in the bed and the manifestation of that is and if you do then you know that things are starting to work and work well. Thank you so much money that was fabulous and we love to have you back issue issues and a Catalano, our president and global investment strategies for blue marble research here in New York  Blog Vinny Catalano thanks so much my pleasure that was trader Vinny Catalano, talking with Adam Davidson me and look at those links in the interview on a blog at npr.org/money is about Iceland actually is on the verge of bankruptcy and country. can’t go back up north currently  Turns out Ruth yeah honey all in Millington Pokémon with happening, so we thought of Lars Christensen the bank and ask him first in line to be on the country level probably the first country to Welly: very very serious, and we have seen very very on Monday alone it fell by more than 30% and continue today  That’s 30% after filing a lot of the last few yet yes we have seven we have now out of the tree to have taken over the country so right now Iceland Iceland is the most destabilize economy in the world right now I guess while I think it it it it is by far the country in the world  Happy blonde people win Icelandic there, borrow money up from overseas rating off of of that. There was something very high note today that you sent out that the Prime Minister announce that he was borrowing money from Russia with him alone off to what snack scenario off of a national American banks meeting out ha ha , ha ha the whole punch from Barrington, the whole country yes but the bank rescue the bank or 10 times bigger in the entire economy. Meaning are many many times bigger than the government. Yes government and that’s not the case in the US that that’s why you can’t pick you up on that and I thought that is having  Large thank you so much we’re gonna be monitoring Iceland carefully today seems like they’re in serious trouble I guess if we wanted to say who second most endangered with happy hungry well I think Slovakia Hungary well Bulgaria, Michelle I sent Adam down in the chair and I asked him to take a question from a listener, so Adam Taylor I’ve been getting this question all day from people coming around the block. This version of it comes from Marissa Brandt. She says the Fed recently an hour  Purchase commercial paper is that money from the bill out or is it additional treasury funds how much money can a treasury really create in that way isn’t the score to contribute to the devaluation of the doll take that fabulous questions and I gotta say I really like the questions harkens back a little bit of something we talked about yesterday, which is how the Fed is different from the treasury department  no this is not part of the $700 billion bail out and also know this is not treasury department money and the treasury department have a very different role as you remember where we talked about monetary policy for treasury wrap so the treasury is like Dhamas like a business they make money most of your taxes, and they spend money on roads and hospitals in aircraft carriers and things like  That is very different. They affectively create money add money to the economy and sometimes they subtract money from the thing with the feds in buying commercial paper. What is commercial paper and what are they fine some commercial paper is like a big I/O you a bang says hey Laura I need $1 billion to get me through the next three months , I’ll give you 1.1 billion three months from now if you give me 1 billion today so what the fit is going to do as they’re gonna they’re gonna be the one who gives the money so Bank of America just pick an example or whatever thinking of a bank says Boy we need $1 billion  to go to the commercial paper market they call Sudan Wall Street put it up on a computer and pretty soon some other bank has an extra billion dollar problem is your billions will take the Iwan will get 1.1 billion back that a 10% interest once but anyway , so now they get to go straight to the federal reserve a little less attractive they’re gonna charge you feed them not gonna except as high anything high risk only gonna buy from the most top rated companies and secure companies and they are going to Bank of America auto already can do this to other vehicles, but now General Electric to go to the fair  Billion to get us through the next three months payroll whatever it is we need 1 billion bucks for commercial paper market really frozen no there’s no movement there or there wasn’t until today so we are gonna go straight to the fifth fifth to give us the billion dollar taco stand here and that they’re there they’re with no one else’s know what I think they’re hoping in what seems to possibly be happening. They are hoping that simply by saying they will do this. It gives confidence to the market and then someone else will step in and say well , the Fed has money they have their own balance sheet which is but they are running through it very quickly. I don’t remember the last time I looked at it but they’ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars when they run out of that they do have to go to the treasury department and say hey, we need some more money so that comes from us from taxpayers Mike I believe we are not yet. They are pretty sure we’re not yet they are but we’re close we’re close very long time so I guess you can affect your money but it’s totally separate from the 700 billion , that was this is really safe so we are going to get paid back will actually probably make money on this trustworthy companies :-) you’re smiling is the most incredible believer Adam thank you thank you Laura thanks Marissa Brent we are npr.org/Murray and that’s the planet money podcast for today and I’m Laura Conway
