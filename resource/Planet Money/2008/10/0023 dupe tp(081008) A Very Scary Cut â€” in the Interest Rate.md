The U.S. lowered a benchmark interest rate today, along a slew of central banks in other countries. Amir Sufi says the fix may lie in getting people to spend more money, somehow. Simon Johnson objects to Europe's patchwork response to the financial crisis. And David Kestenbaum finds a guy who knew the bailout boss way back when.

A lot of people now look back and think the federal government got drunk, and in fact
the American consumers got drunk.
How would you, as president, try to break those bad habits of too much debt and too
much easy credit?
Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway, and I don't want to be the leader of the free world, especially
if I have to answer questions like that one from Tom Brokaw.
Me neither.
Today is Wednesday, October 8th.
It is 3.29 p.m. here in New York, and we are giving the time because this is
such a fast-moving time for all we know.
Something we're saying now is irrelevant because, I don't know, we gave up on the dollar or
who knows what's happening.
Some country went bankrupt.
Some country went bankrupt.
But here's, but we have a wonderful show for you today that I really like.
I think this is our best one yet.
It might be, yeah.
I think this is a very good one.
A little bit after I woke up this morning, got the email alert that there was a global
coordinated rate cut.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks from Europe and the U.K. and Canada
and Sweden and Switzerland all got together and said, hey, let's cut interest rates all
at the same time.
Now, the number might not sound impressive here in the U.S.
They went down half a percent from 2 percent to 1.5 percent, but that is a big, big deal
in the world of central bankers.
It's our feeling here at Planet Money that a lot of people hear this thing, oh, there's
a rate cut.
The Federal Reserve, it's not completely clear what that means.
So we are going to do what Planet Money does.
We're going to break this down.
And we had Laura, I think you said after this, this was your favorite interview we've
done yet.
Oh, yeah.
This was fabulous.
So we have this with Amar Sufi of the University of Chicago Graduate School of
Business.
He's a professor of, well, we'll get into that.
He's a professor of something to do with money.
Definitely.
What is a rate cut?
And why do we care?
Why is this the front page news?
Well, when the Federal Reserve and other central banks cut interest rates, they are effectively
lowering the cost, at least in the short term, of borrowing, both by consumers and
by businesses.
So an attempt to try to revive the economy is usually the kind of goal of having
a cut in interest rates.
That being said, there has been no doubt throughout this crisis that the U.S. Federal
Reserve is quite actively attempting to bolster the economy.
So an additional rate cut by the Federal Reserve is just more of a strong signal that
the Federal Reserve is committed to trying to revive the economy.
But this was not just the Federal Reserve.
I mean, we knew before this morning, because Ben Bernanke basically told us yesterday
that he was going to cut interest rates, but this was coordinated.
We had the Federal Reserve, we had the European Central Bank, we had the Bank of England,
we had Sweden and Switzerland and Canada all cutting rates at the same moment.
What's the significance?
I mean, my life is in dollars.
I live in America.
Why do I care that Sweden and Switzerland and Canada and the U.K. are joining in
on today's global rate cut?
Is that typical?
Do they always do it together?
Well, I think one thing that actually both common everyday people and very high-brow
economists agree upon is that the expectations of consumers, whether they think the economy
is going to be good, whether they think the economy is going to be bad, and also
the expectations of businesses, whether they think the economy is going to be good,
whether it's going to be bad, is absolutely critical to GDP growth.
And the reason is, if I'm confident that the economy is going to be strong, I'm
more likely to go out and buy a new car.
I'm more likely to go out and shop for new clothes.
And part of what the central banks of the world are trying to do is to manage expectations
of consumers and businesses worldwide.
So they've become the therapists, the emotional counselors of the world.
Can you help me with my own anxiety about this, Amir, can I tell you what it is?
First we had the $700 billion bailout bill pass.
The next thing we knew that the Fed was moving into buying commercial paper and basically
saying that it would offer the short-term loans to companies that can't get them
anyplace else.
So that sort of suggested that maybe the bailout wasn't going to be enough.
And then the next day we get up and they've cut the interest rate, which suggests that
neither the bailout nor the move into commercial paper is enough.
I think you're exactly right.
I completely agree with you that part of managing consumer expectations is being
able to convince them that the actions you are taking have a real difference on the
economy.
And I think increasingly looking at the market reaction in the days after the $700
billion bailout, in the day of the commercial paper buyback program, and even today I
just looked, there doesn't seem to be a huge positive reaction.
I think you're right.
It does basically build in the expectation by consumers and businesses and Wall Street
participants that whatever is wrong with the economy, the Federal Reserve doesn't have
the power to fix it.
And that's a very dangerous thing because that just kind of leads to a vicious cycle
where people become very pessimistic and as a result they stop buying, which only
makes the economy worse.
And I want to switch to that, the consumer.
Amar, when you and I spoke on the phone this morning, you said to me you
think there's a debate that is not happening in America.
Basically your profession, economists, the government, and us in the media are just fully
focused on this credit market, on banks lending to each other and lending to other
people as the sum total of this crisis.
You see it differently.
I think that's right.
Let me be clear from the beginning that I think there is a very important credit
crunch going on that is likely to have real effects on the economy.
However, just about every single recession we've had in the last 50, 100 years has been
precipitated by a sharp drop in consumption or sales.
What happens then is that businesses massively cut back on their investment.
They start to lay off workers and therefore we see a dramatic cycle in which the economy
basically goes into sometimes very severe recession.
And consumption, maybe it's just completely obvious, but consumption just means folks
buying stuff.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Sales.
You can think about sales of businesses who are selling Walmart, Target.
So what I think has happened in the last three or four days that kind of shapes my
opinion on these matters is a few reports that have been released that suggest very
negative consumption happening in the third quarter of 2008.
People are not buying stuff.
I've stopped buying things entirely.
I was saying this morning that I went from serving out three pieces of fruit to
my family to two.
And our income is unchanged.
If anything, our personal income has sort of gone up a little bit.
Exactly. And I think the numbers from August are particularly striking.
There was a report that was just released yesterday for consumer borrowing.
So how much consumers are borrowing on credit cards and in auto loans in the month
of August.
And it absolutely plummeted.
It was negative growth for the first time, I think, in almost 15 years.
And that's before the crisis really got into its frenetic pace.
Exactly. Exactly.
And I think that's the point that I have been trying to make, you know, both to my
colleagues and to friends who work on Wall Street, is that consumption seems to
have plummeted even before this credit crunch got to its most severe stage.
How do you fix that?
That's a hard thing to fix.
But I think our standard response to consumption drops has been pretty obvious.
Economists have consistently said that you need fiscal stimulus to be more
specific, tax rebates, which is exactly what we did in the second quarter of 2008.
And that didn't work.
Well, no, in fact, I think it did work.
I have a colleague, Christian Broda, who has done research using AC Nielsen data
that shows that, in fact, in the second quarter of 2008, consumption was
boosted by almost, I believe his number is 2.5 percent, directly in
response to these tax rebates.
So if you go back and look at GDP growth, at just how fast the economy
was growing in the second quarter of 2008, we actually did pretty well.
I think it was positive growth in one or two percent.
I don't remember the exact number.
But if you remember, when the second quarter numbers came out, people were
saying, oh, well, maybe the economy isn't headed for a severe recession.
So we know that having fiscal stimulus, basically getting money back to
households through tax rebates, through direct checks, we know that
affects consumption.
It's very well documented that when the government simply sends people
checks, they will spend part of those checks.
So I think it's been a little surprising to me that all of the policy
response up to this point in the last month has been directed at the
financial industry and not directly at the household sector.
Now, let me be clear about something.
Obviously, they're linked.
Part of the reason consumption is dropping is because likely people
can't get loans through...
Yeah, that was what I wanted to ask.
Are people not borrowing on their credit cards and not borrowing to buy
cars because the bank says, sorry, pal, we're not lending you the money?
Or is it that they're not even asking the bank?
That's a huge question that I wish I could answer more definitively.
But what I will say...
And is that because you personally don't know or it's just...
I personally don't know.
And the data are really hard to come by.
There is no doubt that credit standards, lending standards, I'm
sorry, by banks to consumers have tightened enormously.
Not in September, all the way back since August 2007.
I mean, this has been a very long sustained period of banks just basically
be unwilling to finance mortgages, home equity lines of credit.
This has been a longstanding thing.
It's been pretty shocking that consumption has held up throughout
until probably the third quarter.
Now, I also think that it could be independent of the credit crunch.
Housing prices are plummeting.
Gas prices have increased.
President Bush has gotten on TV and told everyone that the world is about to end.
There are all these reasons that independent of the credit crunch would
lead consumers to cut back on their expenditure.
So is there a role of the credit crunch in the drop in consumption
we're currently seeing?
There is no doubt there is a role.
I don't know right now if it's the major role, if it's the major thing.
Like Laura was saying, I mean, a lot of people I think are just not
buying things because they're scared of the way the economy looks.
Not because they can't get a loan from the bank.
Amir Sufi, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business.
Thank you so much for depressing us in a different way.
We've been depressed in one way so much this week.
It's nice to be depressed in a different way.
Yeah.
Let me just say, Adam, I'm actually a professor of finance, not economics.
I am an economist by training, but just to make sure that that's clear.
The economics guys may say, hey, wait, why is a finance guy
claiming to be a professor of economics?
So Amir Sufi claims to be a professor of economics, but on careful
research, we've learned that he's truly a professor of finance.
Exactly.
Okay.
Thanks a lot.
All right.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Bye.
That was Amir Sufi.
He's a real economist.
We promise you that, although his title is professor of finance, we
actually reached him on, he was celebrating the post Ramadan Eid
holiday at his parents' home in Topeka, Kansas.
Let's do some more news.
As we've been reporting, a number of European banks have
tumbled in the last few days.
And Saturday, the leaders of the EU got together to say how they
would take care of the economy.
Except they didn't exactly say how they were going to take care of it.
And that got Simon Johnson to get out his typewriter.
He banged out something for the Financial Times called the
Europeans still do not get it.
What qualifies Johnson to judge them?
Well, he's a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
He's currently a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
And he so happens to run a website about the economy called Baseline
scenario dot com.
That's a really great site.
He's doing what we're doing.
We get into it in the interview, but go to baseline scenario dot com.
He's trying to just break it down, make it clear.
This is an interview I did with Alex Bloomberg yesterday.
Our baseline view is that the U.S.
is going into a fairly severe recession, but can bounce out of it
pretty quickly because of the nature of the U.S.
And we think policymakers will get their heads around things pretty
quickly.
What the real danger, and this recession obviously affects everyone.
I mean, the U.S.
has got pneumonia.
Everybody's going to get some version of pneumonia.
The problem that what's really worrying is, I think this is what's
worrying the markets right now, is that the response from the
Europeans is really quite disappointing.
They don't have that act together in terms of coordinating even within
the eurozone.
That's the group of European countries that share the euro.
And then there's this conflict or tension between that group and people
who are not in the euro, like the UK and the Swiss.
And then there's this tension and they're not getting on very well
between people who are in the European Union and not in the
European Union.
It's a complete mess.
It's a complete mess in Europe.
And is there a way to understand why they can't just get together?
Is it, you know, is it France versus Germany?
Is that the central argument?
Is it the UK versus the continent?
Or is it everyone against everyone?
I think it's all of the above.
So there was a front.
There was a great France versus Germany moment last week, I believe
on Thursday, when the French popped the question of a bailout fund
to a European gathering.
And this was the idea that all the European countries would jointly
stand ready to bail out any bank in any European country.
Well, it was the European Union.
Remember, they're not the same thing.
Yes, but exactly that idea.
And the German reaction was no, and it'll always be no.
Of course, three days later, the German banking system ran into the
wall and one of their big real estate, the second largest mortgage
lender, had to be rescued not once, but twice because the first
rescue fell to pieces.
So I don't, you know, I don't think the Germans will want to go in
with the French and a bailout fund.
But in fact, all the EU finance ministers met and had some hand
ringing, came out with a pretty lame statement of general principles
or whatever principles.
Principles is what you put in your statement when you don't have
anything really to announce.
So, you know, I don't know, maybe making progress, maybe just bouncing
off each other at this point.
And is it one of those things where it's like where the Germans
have an economic argument to back up their decision not to do it?
Or is it more simply, no, we had until two days ago, we had what
we thought were sound practices and you guys did not have sound
practices and we're not going to help you out of your messes.
I think there's a couple of sort of wrong ideas that are looking
here.
I'm afraid the Germans have got two of them and the, well, the
Brits have got them too, the same two ideas.
And they sort of, they vary a little bit around the content.
First idea is that inflation is still a serious problem.
If not, I mean, we're heading into a terrible credit crisis.
You know, you should think of it, you know, I don't know if
it's 1929 or 1931 or, you know, 1929 to 1933, all in three
weeks, because things move a lot faster now, but it's very bad.
And the second one is they're very worried about moral hazard.
Moral hazard is the idea that if you bail people out, they will
next time or very soon go out and make the same mistakes again.
And you're sort of encouraging bad behavior.
Well, I think moral hazard is a serious issue in financial
systems often, but what I would say to that is, you know, if
you were to come across the Titanic sinking, should you,
you know, would you hang back saying, hmm, if I rescue some
people that might affect shipbuilders' incentives down the
road to build safe ships.
No, of course not.
You would go in and save as many people as you could.
And then he would go and talk to the shipbuilders afterwards,
pretty, in pretty, in pretty certain terms about what they
need to do to improve their practices.
Right.
And so the Europeans are, is it hopeless?
What, what, what's your sense of what we can expect?
It's not hopeless.
These are smart people that they take their jobs
seriously.
They, they learn and they are coming, the fact, they're
all coming to Washington for the G7 meeting of industrialized
countries.
And then the big, there's a big meeting on Saturday of
almost all the finance ministers in the world.
Um, these are important learning experiences.
They're going to be hearing it from a lot of other
countries and they're going to, the Europeans are going to
come under a lot of pressure to sort out their act out.
They're going to try and turn around, I think, and blame
the U S.
Um, and if it turns into a mutual recrimination show,
that will be very bad, but I think that, um, probably
they will start to think more concretely about measures
they can actually take.
And you know, every time, every time a serious
central bank like the fed makes an innovation, like
supporting the commercial paper market, other central banks
look at that and they, without, they see what happens
and they watch it.
And then, you know, if it goes reasonably well, they'll
think about how to apply that in their own experience.
So these are not stupid people and they're not people
who are stuck forever in the same mental model.
They will update, but they'll update, uh, a little
bit slowly because that's the nature of the culture
in those organizations and what they've been trained
to do.
Can I, can I jump in with, with a question and
maybe if this is too big a question, maybe we'll move
on, but, uh, you said that, that you're worried that
they're going to blame the United States and is, are
you worried about that because it's wrong to blame
the United States or are you worried about it because
it will just set, it'll just sort of poison the, poison
this sort of cooperation that needs to go on.
Well, it's only poison the cooperation.
Uh, and you know, Mr.
Paulson approached them, I think it was three
weeks ago now to cooperate on his initial bailout
plan and the rest, six of the G7 said no way.
That was a big mistake on their part.
Um, and so, you know, and they said, it's
your problem, you sort it out.
And, you know, it's more complex than that.
The European banks bought about a half of all the,
uh, securities built on, on what we now call toxic
debt. The estimates done by the IMF back in the
spring, um, which had been disputed, but never
refuted. And I think they're holding up quite
well, actually, is that it was roughly 50 50
where the bad stuff and the losses were going
to be between Europe and the U S now within
Europe, there was variation within Europe.
Um, people, you know, like the Germans and
the French claim they had relatively little of
it. And that was part of the inability to get
ahead of it and, and maybe contributing still
to the paralysis. But of course we've moved
on a lot from that. Now it's a very general
crisis of confidence in, in, in, in the global
financial system. Um, and, um, I'm afraid it's
going to get worse before it gets better.
Well, thanks so much to Simon Johnson. That
helped me a lot understand some of these
challenges.
Meanwhile, Tom Youngs of Pittsburgh checked in
with a question about the bailout of AIG. Tom
notes that the U S rescued the insurer with
an $85 billion loan.
And then I hear yesterday that couple
executives, they were testifying in front of
Congress about some, what would seem excessive
spending at a resort in California. And I
got to thinking if the federal government
owns 80% of this company, that is there some
role the federal government should be
playing in management or control of AIG at
this point?
Tom, that's a really great question. I
want to talk about AIG and then I want
to talk about this issue of government
control more broadly. Basically what
happened is the federal reserve, um, well
we can just call it. They bailed out AIG
after we've done a lot of reporting on it
after the massive world's biggest insurance
company came close to collapsing. And in
return, the U S government, um, has
warrants for stock. Basically it gives
them control of the company, 79.5%
ownership of the company. And right away
they use that control. They got rid of
chief exec, the chief executive. They
got rid of a bunch of senior executives,
put in people apparently chosen by
treasury secretary Henry Paulson to run
the day to day operations. Now what
you're talking about is a few days
later, um, uh, some leading executives
spent $440,000 at the St Regis resort
south of Los Angeles. Um, the AP tells
us it also included $23,380 worth of
spa treatments.
I didn't know that was possible. I'm
sorry, but
well, I don't see how many people it
is.
Come on. You can get your whole
eyebrows tweezed or whatever.
Let's say it was 50 people. That's
500 each. I don't know. Anyway, it's
a company with 116,000 employees,
according to Wikipedia. Um, it has
assets over a trillion dollars. I mean,
it's a massive company and the US
government is definitely not approving
everything. It doesn't have middle
managers in there. You know, uh, it
basically put in a leadership team
and, and is allowing that leadership
team to run things. A broader point
and a crucial point over the next
weeks and months and years, a crucial,
crucial point is what is the US
government's role in private industry?
And this is a new question. This is
the question for all of us as
citizens for the government right
now. I, I covered the war in Iraq
and I was in Iraq the week after
the ground war ended, um, April, I
think I arrived April 12th, 2003.
And I remember later that week, I
happened upon a shoe factory in
Baghdad. And this was a factory
that had been saved from looters.
It was totally intact. And I walked
in and the entire staff was sitting
in the lobby. And I said, Oh, are
you guys, you can't operate the
machinery? They said, no, no, we
have all the oil, we have a
generator, we have everything we
need. We have the raw material,
but we don't know how many shoes
to make or what kind, because
usually it's the government that
tells us. And in a place like
Iraq before the war or in the
Soviet Union or in other, you
know, socialist economies, you
actually have a guy in the
ministry of industry or whatever,
who sits there and says, all
right, shoe company X, you
make 3000 loafers this week.
And it is not a market
mechanism. It's not people
buying and selling. And I
would, I had this sort of
frustrating and fascinating talk
with these folks where I said,
well, there's people out there
who want shoes. You can make
shoes. They said, no, no, we
get our instructions from the
government. And I think it's
safe to say that virtually
nobody in or out of the US
government wants that to happen
for a variety of reasons. The
government is generally
considered not very good at
deciding how to run private
companies. I mean, the
government, you give a lot of
power usually to one person
who's a bureaucrat rather than
the much more complex market
mechanism that exists in a free
market. But we're in a
situation where a lot of
companies in America are
collapsing and the US
government is stepping in. So
what and we taxpayers are
stepping in. So don't we have
a right to call the shots?
This is a fundamental question
that hasn't been answered yet
in the Bernanke Paulson plan
that was passed by Congress
and signed by the president
last week. There is the
option of buying stock, the
government directly buying
ownership of companies. But
the language seems to suggest
they are going to have non
voting shares, meaning they
would, they could own most of
a company, but not have the
right to put someone on the
board, not have the right to
to boss people around. If we
use the AIG model, where
it's literally the treasury
secretary picking the CEO and
directing the actions of the
CEO of most of the major
financial institutions. I mean,
it's hard to say that's not
socialism. It sure smells a lot
like it. So we don't know
yet. The plans are not at
all clear. We don't know
what's going to happen. But
this for guys like me, for
reporters who cover this, for
many, many people, this is
going to be perhaps the
single most important
question of the next year.
Thank you, Tom Youngs. We
hope that helps. And next up,
we have our very own Planet
Money's David Kestenbaum. He
sent us this. This is just
lovely. It turns out that
David knows this guy who
went to school with the man
who is suddenly the most
important person in the US
economy, possibly. And we've
got a picture to prove it.
We have a picture to prove
it. Kestenbaum's friend is
Tom Daltell. He took a class
with Neil Kashkari. Now,
Neil Kashkari is the man who
is it's his job to spend
that $700 billion, which
effectively means he's
getting less sleep than we
are. Yeah, he can choose
which banks survive, which
ones fail. I mean, not to
be too dramatic. The
future of the US economy is
in his 35 year old hands. He
and Tom Daltell went to
school at the University of
Illinois. It was unbelievable.
It was I well, first, I
didn't know who he was. I
just thought I know that
guy. Then I read that he
was in charge of $900
billion or $700 billion or
whatever it is. And you
thought I don't you
thought, wait, I know
that guy. Yeah, it was
very odd. Alright, so tell
me, tell me what you
remember from so you went
to college with him. Yes,
I was an undergraduate. He
was a graduate student. We
were both in mechanical
engineering. He was the
head of the solar car
project, the solar car
project, which is the I
think it's the sun race.
It's a it's now got a new
name. I think it's the
North American solar car
race. So basically you
build that you build solar
cars and you race them
against other smarty pants.
Exactly. Okay. Exactly. So
so we had a car, the
University of Illinois had a
car in the race. And he
was in charge of directing
all the students building
that car. Okay, so he
was running the team and
you were on the team
building the car. Correct.
What else do you remember?
He was funny. I remember
in meetings he would there
was one time we were up
early and we were hooking
up the car, hooking up
the trailer to bring the
car somewhere. And there
was a mechanical
engineer who was the
PhD student who didn't
know which way to put the
lock washer on the
trailer hitch. And he
thought that was very
funny. He was making fun
of them for that. Talked
about how all the
electrical engineers lived
in math space.
Lived in math space.
Correct. Yeah. Did he
live in math space?
No, he was pretty down
earth.
What was he like as an
organizer? Or was he
really intense about it?
What was he like?
He was he was intense.
He was good. He was
intense. He he he was
good at getting people
motivated. I remember at
the time I thought a
couple of the decisions
were a little strange. For
instance, that we were
working on building our
own motor actually
constructing from
scratch with wires and
windings and resin, our
own motor to drive this
car. And I thought even
as an undergraduate, I
thought for sure that
this was not an
efficient way to get a
motor for our car that
we were trying to be as
light as possible and to
be as efficient as
possible.
And what happened?
Our we never got
anything. We spent a
lot of time, you know,
winding copper wire
around models and then
encasing it in resin.
He spent a lot of time in
the lab in particular,
more than a lot more
than I did. But in the
end, we that didn't
work at all. I don't
think we ever got to
a point where we even
tested one of our own
motors.
So you went and bought
one.
We went and bought one.
Yeah.
Which is what he's
doing now. He's buying
up things.
Yeah. Maybe that
would start.
So what do you think
about him managing this
seven hundred billion
dollar stabilization
plan?
Well, you know, like
I haven't seen him in
12 years, so I'm not
other than what I've
just read anecdotally.
I don't really know
that much about what
he's been doing.
I know. I know he was
ambitious and smart,
not ambitious in a
bad way, but he seemed
like he was, you
know, he was driven.
He was smart. He
obviously has done a
lot. I guess I would
say he's, you know,
I don't have any
reason to think he
couldn't do it.
Was your reaction when
you saw the photo like,
wow, this guy I know
is now in charge of
seven hundred billion
dollars.
Yes, it was it was
interesting.
He.
I've actually thought
of him several times
since we were on the
solar car project
together and had
wondered what he was
up to. I figured he
was working for GM
and doing some kind
of automotive or
some kind of high
tech design work,
which I guess he was
for a while working
on satellites.
Yeah, but you're
wrong now.
No, I'm wrong,
which is interesting
because actually now
I'm I'm an economist
also and work in
policy. So it's funny
that taken somewhat
similar tracks, although
my budget's somewhat
smaller than his
budget, apparently.
