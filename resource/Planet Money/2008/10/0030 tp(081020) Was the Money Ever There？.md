**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**
I know many Americans have reservations about the government's approach, especially about
allowing the government to hold shares in private banks.
As a strong believer in free markets, I would oppose such measures under ordinary circumstances.
But these are no ordinary circumstances.
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
Today is Monday, October 20th.
It's about 4.01 p.m. here in New York City.
Adam, you got a first-hand look at the credit markets today.
What's the deal?
Well, I don't want to come out and say it's all good news, but it is better news.
The Planet Money indicators, the main one we talk about here is the TED spread,
which is a rough approximation for global anxiety, for the amount of money moving through
the banking system.
It fell dramatically today.
You actually noticed this before I did.
It fell below 4.
It's now at 2.96, a more than 18% drop.
That's huge.
That is a huge drop.
And 296 basis points, or 2.96, you know, in normal times, before this whole crisis,
you'd want to see that down in the 0.5% area.
So it's still way, way, way in the stratosphere.
But it's nowhere near as far in the stratosphere as it has been, up well above 4.
Yeah, someone was saying that Bloomberg, which has a TED spread indicator, had actually
had to add a 5 to its graph because the TED spread stayed up over 4 for so long.
And creeped up towards 5.
It looks like it almost kissed 5.
And basically, that's a measure of how much risk banks are willing to take on,
how much they're willing to lend to each other.
But I actually was on the front lines of the credit crisis, our friends at Tradition
Agile Securities, Will and Tom, who we talked to so often.
I went down there this morning with Robert Siegel, the host of All Things Considered.
Actually, I think right as we're talking, All Things Considered, he's in New York.
He's just on the other side of this wall here, hosting All Things Considered,
which is just going on the air now.
We went to our favorite money traders to see what was going on.
Tom Corona, this compared to a typical day last year?
Very, very quiet.
The normal flows on a day for us, just in institutional money markets,
a slow day we would transact $3 to $4 billion in fixed state securities,
meaning one month out to one year maturities.
Today, for example, we've transacted I think a total of $300 million.
And that's extremely busy compared to the way it's been the last four weeks.
Yeah, Will Ashton-Rees, about 10 days ago, you described being at work here
as watching paint dry.
Looks a little bit more active than that right now.
Yeah, it is.
But it's almost as if the investing is forced.
What we're seeing is the result of, or the anticipation of,
the capital infusion to certain banks.
And they, in turn, going out and putting it to work in the term market.
The people we're not seeing are the people who continually
have a turnover of money, that being the money market funds.
We've yet to see them return to this market.
The big problem is, if you're a money manager and you're
looking at these yields, these yields are just totally out of sight.
They're salivating.
They wish they could invest.
Yields like what?
Well, you have a Fed funds rate of one to one and a half percent
on any given day, even below 1%.
But you can go out and, if you were allowed to,
invest in the three month at 4% and six months at over 4%,
they would love those returns.
The problem with the money funds, though, is that, while they can buy it,
their fear is that they can't turn around and sell it if another crisis hits.
So, wait a minute, Adam.
The idea is that now people don't want to buy because they're
afraid they can't sell?
Yeah, so there's a few issues going on.
One is, so let's say there's Laura Bank and there's Adam Bank.
And Adam Bank needs money.
I need a billion dollars to get me through the next three months.
I want to borrow money from you.
And you have an extra billion dollars.
So, in normal times, I would just, basically, I'd call Tom or
Will up at Tradition Asial and say, hey, I need to borrow a billion.
You'd call them and say, hey, I have an extra billion.
They'd say, hey, Laura, meet Adam.
Lend him a billion dollars.
So what I'm buying from you is?
Commercial paper.
Commercial paper, okay.
A big industrial sized IOU.
What has stopped happening is that you're willing to lend.
People still need to borrow.
Banks are still desperate to borrow.
But Laura Bank, the many banks, are not willing to lend for two reasons.
One is, they're afraid that Adam Bank's going to go out of business.
We've seen so many major banks go out of business.
They're afraid that if you lend me a billion dollars for
three months, I'm not going to be around to pay it back in three months.
But then the other thing is, even if you're 100% convinced or
99% convinced I won't go out of business, you trust me.
You still might need to sell that commercial paper.
You might need to basically get your loan repaid in a hurry a month from now or
two months from now, because something else might happen in this crazy
financial system, and you might need to have that money available.
And they're scared they can't.
And they're scared that no one else will buy it from them.
So even if the bank is sound,
they're afraid that the investment itself will lose money,
if that makes sense.
And so the lack of trust and the lack of liquidity,
the lack of ability to move in and out of these loans,
which has been absolutely fluid for 40 years, 35 years.
As long as this industry has existed, it's been totally trivial and
easy, has completely frozen up in the last month.
On Friday we saw the barest hint of movement.
Today we're seeing just the tiniest hints of movement.
But we are very far from where we were.
So we have a question today, Adam, from a listener.
And I think it started when I blogged about one of my favorite subjects,
which is imaginary money.
And someone on the blog had asked,
what happens to the money in a write-down?
If a bank says it's now worth 20 billion instead of 30 billion,
where did the other 10 billion go?
Right, and this is a question I get a lot.
Where did the money go?
And it's such a confusing thing, because the simple answer is there is
less money in the world than there used to be.
By the way, David Kestenbaum, our own David Kestenbaum,
if you're listening, remember you owe us a story on this.
Where did the money go?
That's right, David.
We're counting on that.
So what I said on the blog was, it's helpful to think, for
me anyway, of what's missing as value.
That money is to value as degrees are to temperature.
And I was trying to say that if you think of what's gone lost or
gone missing as value instead of money, as in dollars, maybe that will help.
But it immediately led to this question from Kelly Moser of Lincoln, Nebraska.
If the idea is that we are losing value and not physical money,
did we ever really have that money to lose in the first place?
And is that what is meant by deleveraging?
The market trying to find its true value from an inflated one.
Kelly Moser of Lincoln, Nebraska.
I have an economist for you.
He's one of our favorite credit risk analysts, Shoojit Das.
And he can tell you all about deleveraging and
all about what it means when there's less money in the world.
Das says the best way to figure out this word deleveraging is just take that D off.
There's a lot of mystique about leveraging, but
it's really about borrowing money.
Let me explain.
You can go buy a share off a company at $100.
Now if it goes up, say 10%, you gain $10, which is 10%.
However, most of us are a little greedy.
So we say, well, if the share price goes up $10, we want to make more money.
So what we do is instead of paying $100 for the share,
we put $10 of our own money and we borrow $90.
What that means is if the share goes up $10,
we still have to pay back the $90 because the debt has to be paid back.
But our $10 has now become $20.
So our return has gone from 10% to 100%.
And that is the magic of leverage.
And that is what the world has gotten completely addicted to.
And the problem also is it's a bit like a narcotic addiction,
because initially you get a nice hit.
But over time, what we've all done is increased the amount of leverage
to get returns that we've actually wanted.
So you start, if I can just ask quickly.
So you start, the first day you do it, you go, wait,
I just went from 10% to 100%.
This is unbelievable.
A month later, you're thinking, well, 100%, I always get 100%.
I want 1,000%.
That's absolutely exactly correct.
To give you some idea of what the leverage level went,
when I started, I was starting to see people with modest leverage
in the early 1990s.
And they would leverage like three times.
So for every dollar, they would borrow $3.
And the most egregious example of that was people like
the Bayer-Stearns Hitch Funds,
which seemed to be borrowing 20 to 30 times.
So for every $1, they had $20 to $30 of debt.
So it became a terrible addiction.
So they're playing with borrowed money.
Absolutely. We like to not talk about borrowed money.
We talk like all these fancy terms like leverage,
but it's always borrowed money.
And my hunch is you're going to tell us that this is a wonderful thing
when things are going up,
but just like it amplifies the upswing,
it does the same going down?
Absolutely.
So let me explain that on the other side.
So let's say you had the share, which was $100,
and you borrowed $90 and put up $10 of your own money,
and the share price goes up $10, you make 100%.
But the problem is if the share price falls $10,
then you've wiped out all your money.
And what can be extremely, extremely difficult is,
let's say the shares fall by $20.
Then, of course, you've wiped out the $10 you've had,
but you now also owe the person you've borrowed the money from
an extra $10 because the shares are only worth $80 now
because, remember, they've fallen by $20 from $100,
but your debt is still at $90
because debt does not change in its value,
and that is the problem
that the world is actually facing at the moment.
We have a huge amount of debt.
The problem is what we bought with it,
ranging from houses, from shares,
from just about every type of financial asset,
what has happened is those assets
are now falling in value,
which means we have a major problem.
And so the answer to that is deleveraging.
And when we talk about deleveraging,
what that actually means is you've got too much debt
and you've got to get out of debt.
And what we're now seeing is the world reduce leverage.
And, of course, the real problem was
that it was the leverage,
the ability to borrow money to buy assets
forced the price of houses
and all these other assets, like shares, up,
and now they're falling.
And so it starts to accelerate the fall,
and that's why we're seeing stock markets fall.
That's why we're starting to see housing prices
fall so precipitously.
And we see banks no longer lending money to other banks,
banks not lending money to us, to companies.
That's absolutely right.
Now, the banks are a very interesting example
of why we focus so much on the banks,
because leverage is created by banks,
because banks, at the end of the day,
are the bulk of people who lend money.
So it's not surprising that they were always going to be
at the epicenter of this problem.
Now, banks themselves are actually highly leveraged,
and this is one of the really strange contradictions.
They create leverage,
but they themselves are very highly leveraged,
because they only really have $1 of share capital
for roughly every $10 of loans they make.
Now, in some cases, like the investment banks,
like the much lamented and departed Lehman Brothers
and Bear Stearns and people like that,
they essentially started to leverage by 20 to 30 times.
And in one of the most amusing little anecdotes
about this crisis is Henry Paulson,
the U.S. Treasury Secretary,
in about 2000 went to Capitol Hill
and argued that the investment banks
were so good at managing their own risks,
they should be allowed to leverage more.
So you've got the two things.
They've lent money to people who've leveraged,
but they themselves have a lot of leverage.
They've borrowed the money that they've lent.
So as this chain sort of starts to go into reverse,
they start to lose enormous amounts of money.
And what happens is when they wipe out
their share capital, which is what they've done,
they can't lend any more money,
which is at the epicenter
of the process you've just described,
which is they've stopped lending money to other people.
So let me see if I try and picture these things
and try and make a very simple model.
So I have a dollar.
I call you up and say,
hey, will you lend me nine bucks?
I want to lend $10 to Laura
because she's got this business plan.
And so you give me nine bucks.
I give Laura 10 bucks.
She takes that $10 and she does whatever it is.
She starts her tambourine musical business.
I'm thinking of that, yeah.
You've thought about that.
And the first few weeks she's making money.
She's paying back the loan.
I'm able to pay you back.
Everyone's happy.
But then all of a sudden,
it turns out, shockingly,
she's not a very good tambourinist
and no one is paying her money.
Sorry.
You're looking very upset at this analogy.
An artist has her pride.
Yes.
And so she can't pay me back.
I can't pay you back.
And it turns out you owed someone else the money
and on and on and on.
That's sort of the model we're thinking of.
Absolutely.
And there's a really, really bad element in this.
I only wish we'd lent to Laura the tambourine player.
The problem is we didn't actually lend to real businesses.
What we did in this speculative fervor that was going on
is we just kept buying assets like houses and shares.
And because there was this flood of money,
those assets kept going up and up in value.
Nobody was really looking
at whether those values were sustainable.
They were also not looking whether the income
from the person borrowing the house
was sufficient to service the debt.
Because the picture we had was effectively
if the asset kept going up, well, that's fine.
It doesn't really matter whether you have the cash
because you can reborrow to pay the interest
and pay back the loan.
So deleveraging is the process
of pulling back from being leveraged?
Correct.
Deleveraging is about getting rid of the debt.
And what we're seeing now is the simple process.
Now, it's all very common sense.
If you have too much debt as an individual, what do you do?
If you have something to sell, your tambourine
or your whatever, you sell it,
take the money and pay off debt.
Alternatively, you stop spending money.
You don't have a Starbucks cappuccino.
You basically drink water from the tap.
So under those circumstances,
you reduce your consumption.
Now, companies also do that, but they don't invest.
Like you might've thought you would go
to franchise your tambourine concept
and basically expand across the United States.
But you don't do that.
And that is what is actually happening now.
So people are trying to sell assets.
And the problem is there is no market
for many of those assets.
Certainly not at the prices that these people paid.
It's the prices of everything is falling.
The second thing is happening is people not consuming,
people not spending and the shops
or wherever they spend.
And companies are cutting back on investments.
And that's why the whole economy is slowing.
Kelly Mosher, I hope that explanation
from Suchajit Das helps you.
We're looking forward to breakfast
with Suchajit Das on Saturday.
He's in town from Australia.
Hey, Laura, you got that tape from Hannah
you were telling me about?
Yeah, I did.
And I actually caught up with her too.
We're talking about Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
She freelances for Planet Money out of KPLU in Seattle.
She's our favorite.
She's our favorite.
Yes, we love her.
We're in a very positive mood today.
You know, Ben Bernanke, the Fed Chairman,
says that he supports an economic stimulus.
That's lifted my mood today, definitely.
I'm waiting for the check.
Hannah Jaffe-Walt recently did a segment
about her own mail carrier, a woman named Andrea.
She, you know, has a bit of information
like where somebody works and who they live with
and then she will make up a whole story
about who they are.
And lots of mail carriers do this.
I think Andrea is particularly interested in people.
And so she notices, you know, trends that happen.
She notices when money gets tight
or when credit is harder to come by.
So when people started, you know,
lugging out this big Main Street cliche,
I kept thinking about Andrea
and how she's, you know, on the streets
and she really is actually has a unique perspective
on what people's money stories are through their mail.
Was it hard to get her to talk to you?
It wasn't.
She actually, I mean,
she walks around by herself every day.
So I think she was just so psyched
to have anybody interested
in the things that she notices
and the information that she has
that people don't really, you know,
aren't aware that mail carriers have
about the neighborhoods that they deliver to.
So she was totally psyched to talk to me.
Kata Jaffee-Walt, thank you.
Let's roll some tape.
Okay, before we can do this,
I need to clear up one question.
Yes, your mailman reads your postcards.
She notices what magazines you get, which catalogs.
She knows everything about you.
At least if your mailman is Andrea Dymayevsky.
So from delivering people's mail,
I know where their family lives,
what investments they have if they have investments,
where they go to the dentist,
where they go to the doctor.
I know who's retired, who's interested in opera,
member of the NRA,
member of the Society of Jesuits, whatever.
Point is, Andrea knows a ton
about what's going on in that place
politicians love to name drop recently,
Main Street America.
I ask her to please take me there.
Main Street's about three quarters of a mile south of here,
but I guess yes.
Andrea doesn't skimp on the salty mailman attitude.
She owns the street on her route here in Seattle,
a wide residential block where Section 8 housing
butts up against glassy, snazzy new chic condos
that cost half a million dollars.
Let's see, medical coupons from the state.
Lots of bills.
We start in the subsidized housing.
Andrea notices her unemployed mom
with an affinity for black leather
is getting another overdraft notice.
The minister is getting more late payment bills.
Lots of bad news mail heads into these little boxes.
Collection notices on parking tickets
to overdue utility bills,
to towing lots that have cars
that people aren't coming to pick up.
Here's how the Andrea Mailman Index works,
AMI for insiders.
Certified letters, a major negative indicator.
Credit problems almost always lead to certifies
and certifies are almost always bad news mail.
Another measure, color.
Normal utility bills, they're usually white.
When you're a month late, the envelopes turn yellow.
Way, way late, they all go red.
Andrea's been noticing a lot of red lately.
And one more signal of a downturn
in the Mailman Index of economic indicators,
more names on each mailbox.
I've noticed a lot of people moving in
with grandparents or something.
I'm just assuming that's what it is
because it's a young guy who's getting
like hot rod magazine and all of a sudden
he's living with this like 80 year old woman
who's on social security.
On the other end of the block,
Andrea heads over to a couple businesses.
And this little cafe across the way,
they don't have any mail today
but I think they're in trouble.
You think they're in trouble?
Yeah.
And I'll tell you how I know
once we're a little out of your shop,
which is one time I came in,
they're always getting like credit things
like, oh, you can get a credit card with us,
you can borrow more money,
American Express Business Services, whatever.
I was like, oh, all I have is one of these today.
And he's like, well, that's good,
you give me those so I can give you these.
And he gave me back a stack of paid bills.
So he was pretty much admitting to the fact
that he needs credit card offers
in order to pay his bills.
I'm guessing that that's not
a really sustainable situation.
And that was a while ago.
These days, as Andrea watches the bad news mail
gather into heavy stacks,
the other kind of mail,
that really dependable kind, credit card offers,
have started to go away.
I still see credit cards sending out stuff
but it has really, really gone down.
There used to be a lot more of that.
This is the way the Andrea Mailman Index
registers that thing we've been hearing
so much about lately, the credit crunch.
Companies are less willing to lend money,
credit card issuers less willing
to give people credit cards.
But the credit card companies
aren't coming to people's homes
to tell them, none for you, no thank you.
Andrea shows up on their Seattle doorsteps,
hands empty of free credit
and full of red envelopes and certifies.
People always joke with me,
please don't give me any bills, no bills today.
And those jokes are usually funny
but sometimes people have a real desperation
and they see me and their face falls
because it's like, what am I gonna bring today?
The TED spread doesn't care about feelings,
it cares about interest rates, that's it.
The Andrea Mailman Index, it's got its data
but the AMI sees other things too.
It sees human beings, people living their lives,
making their weird, irrational, shaky judgments.
The AMI takes into account humanness.
Well I see a lot of people who you know
are in financial problems
and then they're getting packages from a company
like QVC or Finger Hut
and people just keep buying them,
buying them and buying them, on credit.
And at the same time,
you're bringing them certified mail.
With their package from QVC.
The government is just starting
on its $700 billion plan.
As it moves forward,
Wall Street analysts will be watching Wall Street,
Fed economists will be watching Wall Street,
Andrea will be watching the mail.
That was Hannah Jaffe-Walt, thank you,
talking about the mailman indicator.
And Adam, are you like wall to wall
in all things considered, right?
I'm not sure, I gotta talk to them.
They're here.
They're here, Robert Siegel's in town all week,
native New Yorker, Stuyvesant high school grad,
much like me and he grew up in Stuy Town
and he's here to meet with lots and lots of people
in New York to see the crisis firsthand
and I'll try and tag along to a few of those.
Where might you go besides the money market traders?
Well, I'm trying to arrange an interview
with Tim Geithner, the head of the New York Fed.
He will never be recorded for broadcasts
so we have to figure out what to do.
Do we interview him and then have an actor
perform the words he said?
I honestly, I'm actually asking that.
I don't know what to do.
Caitlin, would you play his part?
All right, she says yes.
She says yes.
Also, I just wanted to say something quickly.
In case it's not incredibly obvious,
Planet Money, we are really making this up
as we go along, I think that's fair to say.
I studied.
You studied, all right.
Well, I'm making it up as I go along
and I feel really happy with the podcast
but there's some things that I wanna do
to expand it that we've talked about
and we just haven't had the time to do.
So one is the daily check-in,
how the credit crisis is affecting real people
and I hope we get a chance to do that this week.
Yeah, we've actually got some comments
and emails from people who are volunteering
so we'll be following up even more.
Yeah, exactly.
So I'm very excited to do that this week.
I'm trying to encourage us to create some wikis
because the other thing I wanna do
is get a reading list for myself
and I think a lot of people would like that.
I feel like there's some basic things
I wanna understand better.
One is I really wanna understand
what the government response to the Great Depression was,
what happened during that time,
looking into what are the new rules
that are gonna be written over the next year
or two that are gonna completely transform capitalism.
I feel like I'm not as prepared
as I'd like to be for that analysis.
But that is all to come in the future.
There's something you want our listeners to do?
Yeah, I was gonna say someone asked me today
if there's anything that I wish
that you guys out there would do
that you're not doing.
And the one thing I wish you would do,
actually, first of all,
is take pictures of the economy you see around you.
Katelyn Kenney put up a picture,
actually, on our Facebook group,
which is a great place for you guys to post photos.
It's just right there for you.
Just join it and post to it.
She took a great picture of a guy,
panhandler with a sign,
saying that he was suspending his panhandling campaign
for the economic crisis.
I took a picture this weekend.
I don't have it up yet,
but I hope to put it on the Facebook group soon
of a bagel shop saying that
because of a drop in flour prices,
it was actually gonna drop the price of its bagels.
Wow, where was that?
It was in Brooklyn Heights.
The one on Court Street there?
No, on Montague.
I don't know.
Come get a cheaper bagel, I guess.
But I will link to our Facebook group.
Actually, I'd put it in every podcast post
we do on the blog.
And if you guys would join the group
and start sending pictures of the economy
as you see it,
I think we could have a lot of fun with that.
And that'll do it for Planet Money today.
My other pledge, my personal pledge,
is to blog more.
You have really been...
I have not blogged enough.
I think the threat level
may be reaching orange on that.
Yeah, you're really...
I have to blog more.
Please join us at that blog,
npr.org slash money.

because you're listening to it right now.
I'm Adam Davidson.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Thanks for listening.

Hi and welcome to NPR is planet money I’m Adam Davidson and I’m Laura Conaway today’s Monday, October 20. It’s about 4:01 PM here in New York City Adam you got a first-hand look at the credit markets today what’s the deal? Well, if I don’t want to come out and say it’s all good news, but it is better news the planet money indicator , we talk about here is the Ted spread which is a rough approximation for global anxiety for the amount of money moving through the banking system felt dramatically today. You actually noticed this before I did it fell below for 2.960 more than 18% drop that is a huge drop and 296.96. Do you know in normal times before this whole crisis even wanna see that down in the 0.5% area so it’s still way way way in the stratosphere but it’s nowhere near as far in the stratosphere as it has been up well above four. Yeah someone was saying that Bloomberg which has a Ted spread indicator had actually had to add a five to its graph  of over for for so long and creeped up towards five. It looks like it almost kissed five and basically that’s a measure of how much risk banks are willing to take on how much they’re willing to learn to each other, but I actually was on the front lines of credit crisis, our friends, a tradition, angel securities a will and Tom and we talk to sell often I went down there this morning with Robert Siegel the host of all things considered. Actually, I think, right as we’re talking all things considered he’s in New York it’s just on the other side of his wall here  Just going on the air now and we went to our favorite money traders to see what was going on at a time corona this compared to a typical day last year. Oh very very quiet. The normal flows on the day for us. In the markets. A slow day. We would get a transact 3 to 4,000,000,006 one month out to one year maturity today for example, with transact Nicolas 300 million that’s extremely busy compared to the way it’s been the last four weeks you will Ashton reset about 10 days ago you described being at work here as watching paint dry a little bit more active than that right now yeah it is but it’s it’s almost as if the investigation  of what we’re seeing is the result of or the anticipation of the capital infusion to certain banks, and they intern going out and putting it to work in the term market the people were not saying are the people who continually have a turnover of money in the money market funds we get to see that return to the  Market. The big problem is if your money manager and you’re looking at is yields is yields or just totally out of sight the salivating they wish they could invest he was like like one while you have the app fed funds rate of a one to one and a half percent on any given day even below one percent, but that you can go out to know if you were allowed to invest in a three month at 4% for six months it over 4% they would love those return the problem with the money for the snow is that while they can buy at the fear is that  They can’t turn around and sell it if another crisis hits the idea is it now people don’t want to buy because they’re afraid they can’t sell yet so there’s a few issues going on what is there’s Laura bank and Adam bank needs money I need $1 billion to get me through the next three months I want to borrow money you have an extra billion dollars  so in normal time bhagas basically a call Tom or will affect hey I need to borrow billion you call them and say have an extra billion they take a warm meet Adam let him $1 billion so what I’m buying some music commercial paper commercial with big industrial size I am what has stop happening is that you’re willing to let people still need to borrow a bank  Borrow with Laura bank than anything 1 is there afraid that Adam banks gonna go out of business you know that we’re seeing so many major banks by the business they’re afraid that if you let me $1 billion, but then the other thing is even if you’re 100%, convinced to 99% of its I won’t go out of Trust  You still might need to sell that commercial paper. You might need to basically get your loan repaid hurry financial system and you might need to have that money available scared that no one else will buy it so even if the bank is sound afraid of the investment itself with his money, if that makes sense, and so that the lack of trust, and the lack of the lack of ability to to move in and out of this loan, which has been absolutely  40 years 35 years as long as this industry has completely frozen up in the last month on Friday was having barest hint of movement they were saying we are very far so question today Adam from the listener and I think it started when I blocked about one of my favorite subjects which is imaginary money someone on the blog had asked what happens to the money in a write down. If your bank says it’s not worth 20 billion instead of 30 billion where did the other team billion go right and this is a question I get a lot where did the money go and it’s such a confusing think of the simple answer is there is less money in the world dinner used to be by the way David Kestenbaum around if You’re , listening. Remember you owe us a story or counting on that so what I said on the blog with think for me anyway of which missing as value that money is to value is Riz art and I was trying to say, but if you think of which was gone Lauster gone missing is value instead of money, isn’t dollars maybe that will help, but it immediately went to this question how many Mosher of Lincoln Nebraska if the idea is that we are losing value enough physical money did we ever really have the money to live in the first place, and is that what is meant by the leveraging the market, trying to find a true value from inflated one Kelly Mosher  Raska, I have an economist for you. He’s one of our favorite credit risk analysts the ass, and he can tell you all about the leveraging and all about what it means when there’s less money in the world that says the best way to figure out this word deal everything is just take that deal  Leveraging but it’s really about borrowing money you can go buy off the company $100 in dollars little greedy dollar you wanna make more money so what we do $100 we put in dollars of our own money and we borrow $90 for that mean $10 we still have to pay back the $90 to be paid back  Now become $20 has gone from 10% to 100% and that is the magic of leverage. The world has gotten completely addicted like a narcotic overtime. What we’ve all done eating demon leverage to get Rika? that we actually want it I don’t want to use if I can just as quickly so you start the first day you do it you got a wait I just went from 10% to 100%. This is unbelievable a month later you’re thinking of 100%. I always get 100% I want to thousand percent  Absolutely exactly correct give me some idea of what’s the leverage level wind when I started I was going to see people with the 1990s average like shit for every dollar tree dollars and dime bag with people like we seem to be borrowing 20 to 30 time for every one dollar and $20-$30 a day  Borrowed money absolutely not. I took my borrowed money look like always borrowed money and my hundred if you’re going to tell us that this is a wonderful thing when things are going up but just like it, amplifies the ups, swing it it does the same going down absolutely on the other side you had to share which was $100 and you borrowed $90 and put , your own money and the share price goes up $10 you make 100% but the problem is if the share price for $10 then you add all your money at one extremely $20 $10 but you know oh far is the money from an extra $10  And by $20 my 190 is not changing it and that is the problem at the world events at the moment we have a huge amount today. The problem is what we bought with it ranging from houses every type of financial asset what happened to the amount falling in value which means we have a major problem that is, he never came  Mean out of date or reduce leverage and of course the real problem God borrow money out of houses, and now they falling salary before and that’s why we think stock market for that’s why we study and we see banks, no longer lending money to other banks, banks, not lending money to us to companies  Banks are very interesting example of why at the end of the day are the Balkan people who lent money always going to be at the epicenter of this problem addiction they create Clairbridge very highly beverage only really have one dollar to share capital every $10 they make Edmond Bang like the musclemen kitten departed Lehman brothers  And daddy to like that officially started to leverage by 20 to 30 times about the musing little anecdote tree in about 2000 and they should be allowed to leverage more leverage have a lot of leverage. They borrowed the money that they left so I had to change into reverse  For money and what happens when they wipe out the shit or money which is at the epicenter of stock lending money to other people, so let me see if I try to picture these things and try and make make a very simple model success so I I have a dollar I call you up and say hey will you let me nine bucks I want to win $10 to Laura cause she’s got this business plan  And for you you give me nine bucks I gave Laura 10 bucks she takes that $10 and she does whatever it is she starts her you know tambourine of musical yeah you thought about that in the first few weeks she’s making money she’s paying back the loan I’m able to pay you back everyone’s happy but then all of a sudden  it turns out shockingly she’s not a very good tambourine us and no one is paying her money. Sorry an artist has her price yes and so she can’t pay me back. I can’t pay you back and it turns out you owe someone else the money and on and on and on that that’s sort of the model were thinking of absolutely and the super really really bad element in there I only wish Wheatland, Laura tambourine , the problem is we didn’t actually Linda real business at what we did was going on Bang Avenue. It’s like houses and shit going up and up in value income from the person borrowing behalf a picture we had was effectively if it doesn’t really matter whether you borrow to pay the interest and pay back delay so deleveraging is the process of pulling back from being leveraged correct is about getting rid of the debt and what we think now is a simple process  About it’s all very common sense. If you have too much debt is individual, what are you do if you have something tambourine or your whatever you feel it, take the money and pay off debt. Alternatively, you stop spending money you don’t have a Starbucks cappuccino you basically drink water from the tap reduce your consumption like you might’ve thought you would get a franchise your tambourine concept I basically actually happening now paid off spending at the shops or wherever they spend on companies investment and that’s why the whole calling meet Kelly Mosher I hope that! Suture cheat death helps. You were looking forward to breakfast with gas on Saturday Heyward, you got that paper, you were telling me about yeah, I didn’t actually caught up with her to be talking about Hannah Jaffe walk freelances for planet money out of Kpop you in Seattle she’s our favorite were very positive mood today. You know Denver Niki, the Fed German says that he supports an economic stimulus mood today. Definitely I’m waiting for the check how to draw if you want recently did a segment about her own mail carrier a woman name Andrea  and then he will make up a whole story about you. They are and I love you particularly I’m interested in people and 13 notices you know times that happened credit is Carter come by so when people started no bugging out the Creque about Andrea now he’s a no on the street because he really is actually having a unique perspective on what people money story of our friends to their mail. Was it hard to get her to talk to you , it wasn’t he actually I mean he wants around by your self every day the things that she notices on the information that she has the people that really you know aren’t aware of it but now carriers have a balcony delivered to call Jeffy Walt thank you let’s roll some tape OK before we can do this I need to clear up one question yes your mailman  how do I ask? At least if your mailman is Andrea Salinas in the mail I know where the family lives in Dokter I know who’s retired. He’s interested in the opera member of the NRA member of society who is Andrea knows Acong about what’s going on in that place politicians love to me and drop Main Street in America I asked her to please give me streets are bad  people is a mile south of here but I guess yes skimp on the salty mailman attitude. She owns the street on her route here in Seattle wide residential block with section 8 housing that’s up against lasis navigate Eki condos that cost half $1 million. see we starting to subsidize housing  infinity for black leather is getting another overcast late payment bills lots of bad news now has increased little box collection notices on parking tickets to overdue utility bills to towing. Lots of cars and people are coming to pick up your saw the Andrea mailman index. Where am I for insiders certified letters a major negative indicator set a problem  at five and certifies are almost always sad news now another measure color, normal utility bill on your monthly envelopes and yellow. We will eat it all go read Andrea three noticing a lot of weather downturn in the mailman index of economic indicators more names on each mailbox I’ve noticed a lot of people moving in with grandparents but I’m just assuming that’s what it is because it’s a young guy he’s getting like hot rod magazine of Sanni. He’s living with something you know this like 80 year old woman who is this on Social Security , on the other end of the block Andrew heads over to a couple businesses and shovel a little out of your shop inches in my credit is today and he’s like well that’s good you give me a so I can give you these bills needs credit card offers Lord I’m guessing that that’s not really sustainable situation and that was a while ago. These days is Andrea watches the bad news nail gather into heavy stack the other  kind credit card offers started to go away. I still see credit cards sending out stuff but it has really really going down there used to be a lot. This is the way the Andrea mailman index registers that thing we can drink so much Welly the credit companies in less going to my money credit card issuer  but the credit card companies are coming to peoples homes to tell them that I’m for you no thank you Andrea Seattle doorstep and empty a free credit and full of red envelopes and certified for always joke with me. Please don’t give me anything and those jokes are usually funny, but sometimes people have a real desperation in there  baseball today the kids bread doesn’t care about the Andrea mailman go to Sita am I sees other things to people living there live to do their weird, irrational, shaky judgment the am I takes into account human what I see a lot of them feel people you know are in financial problems  getting company like QVC Fingerhut on credit and at the same time you’re bringing money for five mail your package from QVC starting on it $700 billion plan as it moves forward Wall Street analysts will be watching Wall Street will be watching wall speed. Andrea will be watching email on a Jackie walk. Thank you talking about the mailman indicator. Are you like wall-to-wall office?
