Stocks in Europe tanked enough to make America's trading freefall on Monday look not so bad. But don't be fooled. The global economy needs a fix. It's just not necessarily going to like the medicine.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BETTY MCCOLLUM: You're saying yes to all?

RICHARD FULD: Yes.

MCCOLLUM: And when you were raising that capital, no one your...

FULD: No, no. I'd like to finish, though...

MCCOLLUM: ...No one in your firm...

FULD: I'd like to finish because there's a different piece to that. What we were looking to do was to raise capital after we completed...

MCCOLLUM: You were raising capital.

FULD: Excuse me, please.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARNIE STERN'S "EVERY SINGLE LINE MEANS SOMETHING")

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hi. And welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson. I'm here, of course, with Laura Conaway.

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

Tough day out there.

DAVIDSON: Sure was. Today is Monday, October 6. It is now 6:02 p.m.

CONAWAY: In New York.

DAVIDSON: In New York. That clip you just heard was from Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota giving it really hard to Richard Fuld. Fuld is the former CEO of Lehman Brothers who watched the old firm collapse. Turns out that was not the worst thing to happen to Richard Fuld recently. CNBC reported today that right when Lehman Brothers was announcing its plans for bankruptcy, Richard Fuld went to the company gym to do - have a little workout. And a guy there punched him and, reportedly, knocked him out. They were so angry. We thought CEOs of investment banks got more deferential treatment than that.

The U.S. Treasury Department today released its initial plan for fixing this whole mess. They started to let us know how they're going to spend that $700 billion check they gave. And we also learned who's going to be the boss of the project. It's Neel Kashkari, a 35-year-old wunderkind who works for Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson now at the Treasury Department. And he worked for him before at Goldman Sachs, where Paulson was the CEO.

Meanwhile, it has been an ugly day for stock investors, that's for sure. The stock fell 800 points before skirting upwards again and ending 360 points down. I generally don't like talking about the Dow Jones Industrial Average, not my favorite index. I don't think it's the most useful. But a day like today, where it falls below 10,000 and goes back to its 1999 level, it's hard not to talk about it, isn't it, Laura? Everywhere was down. Asian markets were down sort of similar levels. In Europe, it was really ugly after a weekend of just grim economic news and a total failure of the European countries to reach a unified approach to solving the crisis. Stocks there fell far more than they fell here, 9% in France. That's a lot. Jon Macey is deputy dean of the Yale Law School. He's the deputy to the dean, I guess. Is that what that means? He's kind enough to walk us through today's events.

First off, I just want to jump in since it is the thing in the news. We're talking at 420. So the New York Stock Exchange just closed to for the people who haven't seen it was a pretty gruesome day for stock markets around the world, huh?

JONATHAN MACEY: It was incredible. I was in Italy one week ago. And the attitude over there was, well, there may be some, you know, echoes here. But this is basically a U.S. subprime problem. And the central bankers there were of that kind of a containment view. And we see how quickly the world has moved out from under us in such a very short period of time.

DAVIDSON: So this morning, people woke up in Asia and started selling stocks very quickly. I mean, we had a horrible day here in New York. But as you were saying, we actually had a good day compared to some other foreign stock markets.

MACEY: Yeah. I mean, it is incredible that, you know, we have caught a cold here in the U.S. and it seems to be giving the Europeans pneumonia. And I think that the reason for that is that as disorganized and disjointed as the U.S. response was - has been to our financial crisis, the - there's much less optimism even about the Europeans' ability to launch a sort of concerted governmental response on a European, as opposed to a country-wide basis.

CONAWAY: Wasn't the European Union supposed to make responding to this kind of thing easier?

MACEY: Well, the problem that we have in Europe is that - well, the short answer is, yes. The problem is that the people thought it was plenty, including me, for that matter - it was plenty just to form a European Central Bank. And they have a European Central Bank that does on a Europe-wide basis what our Fed does, which is to conduct monetary policy. The difference is that in the U.S., our Fed is under the aegis of the Department of the Treasury, which does fiscal policy. And when there's a huge emergency, those policies can be combined, which is what we saw with the recent statute, you know, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the so-called Paulson plan. But in - the fiscal policy in Europe, all the treasuries are separate and based in each individual European country.

DAVIDSON: And I want to just cut you off, Jon, because we are in a jargon-free zone here at PLANET MONEY.

MACEY: OK.

DAVIDSON: And I - and in my view, fiscal policy and monetary policy, that's jargon.

MACEY: All right.

DAVIDSON: That's not something people who aren't deputy deans of...

MACEY: Fair enough.

DAVIDSON: ...Necessarily know. And I'm going to take the lead on this. Monetary policy is what the Fed does, what Ben Bernanke, in this case, does...

MACEY: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: ...And Alan Greenspan used to do. And to cut it down to the bare minimum, it's basically they get to decide how much money there is. And fiscal policy...

CONAWAY: Wait a minute. How much money there is - that means they move the interest rates up and down, right?

MACEY: Correct.

DAVIDSON: But the process by which they move it up and down, they actually put more money into the market or take more money out of the market.

MACEY: Right.

CONAWAY: OK. Fiscal policy?

MACEY: What they do by their actions...

DAVIDSON: That's monetary.

MACEY: ...They expand and contract the money supply. That's exactly right.

DAVIDSON: Right.

CONAWAY: Now let's do fiscal policy.

DAVIDSON: Now, fiscal policy...

MACEY: Fiscal policy, in a word, is tax.

CONAWAY: Yes.

MACEY: And in another word, are...

DAVIDSON: Spending.

MACEY: Is spending and, in modern fiscal policy, is spending ceilings. So we would have been unable to - you know, we would have been unable to do this Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 without raising the amount of money - raising the size of the U.S. budget deficit.

DAVIDSON: Right. You almost talked about monetary policy. We were talking about fiscal policy.

MACEY: Right.

DAVIDSON: So when you say...

MACEY: And so the central bank can't do that in Europe. The central banks, you know, you need the treasuries in all of these countries to act in a concerted way. They don't have a single institution that can do what our Treasury did, which is, basically, blow the roof off spending.

DAVIDSON: Right. So in the U.S., you can actually see Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson. Normally, these two jobs would be very separate. You'd want to keep them separate. I mean, they coordinate from time to time, but the idea is that the central bank will be - the Fed will be an independent-of-politics organization. And the Treasury secretary is, obviously, a political appointee. I mean, I guess the Fed chairman is, too, but that - let's not get into that. Whereas in Europe, the Ben Bernanke of Europe is Jean-Claude Trichet at the European Central Bank. He sort of is in charge of all the euro, so he oversees the money of all the eurozone. But then each country has their own Henry Paulson - their own finance minister.

MACEY: Exactly. And each country decides on how much they're going to tax people, what sort of internal budget deficit each country is going to run and whether, you know, that'll be expanded or contracted. That's done separately from the European Central Bank.

DAVIDSON: Right. So that's what's got you scared - the fact that they are not responding in a unified way.

MACEY: Right. It's going to take them longer to coordinate. It's kind of ironic because the political will there - the disposition towards activist intervention is actually much greater, but the transaction cost of getting everyone together is also higher. So you have the - you know, in a way, a greater will and consensus ideologically than you have in the U.S., but it's much - you know, who's going to pay what is a very difficult question and how it's going to be paid...

DAVIDSON: And getting French and German and Italian finance ministers to all agree...

MACEY: Right. Exactly.

DAVIDSON: ...That's tough. All right. Let's move to what I'm holding in my hand, which is process for selecting asset managers, the interim guidelines for conflict of interest. Basically, what I'm talking about is what the Treasury Department issued today. This is their the most we've learned yet on how they are going to spend our $700 billion. I count, in total - one, two, three, four, five - six pages. Although, two are pretty small, so I'm going to call it five pages.

MACEY: OK.

DAVIDSON: That's not what you normally expect in a government report, five pages?

MACEY: No, no. But, you know, we're moving fast here. The original bailout plan itself, which blossomed into about 480 pages, started out at three. So I'm sure this will have the same - they will - the same metastasis will apply to this.

DAVIDSON: All right.

CONAWAY: What are you seeing in there?

MACEY: Well, you know, it's exactly - no surprises, you know? Basically, there are going to be a bunch of people in the business on Wall Street who are going to, you know, be buying up on - as agent for the government.

DAVIDSON: Wait, wait. I want to stop you right there. That was one of the sentences that grabbed my eye. This is the third paragraph. (Reading) Financial agents - asset managers will be financial agents of the United States and not contractors. That seems like a very important distinction, but I don't understand it.

MACEY: OK, so the basic idea, in other words, is that these people will be part of the government, right? So in other words, if you think about somebody who does work for the government, they can either be independent contractors or they can be agents performing work directly on behalf of the government. And these people are in the latter category.

DAVIDSON: What does that mean? So this is going to be a guy - does that mean they all work in D.C. and they get...

MACEY: No. It's a legal - it basically means that...

DAVIDSON: That I can't sue them?

MACEY: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

CONAWAY: Hey, I like this in-a-word business...

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

CONAWAY: ...Or in a phrase.

DAVIDSON: This is very helpful.

MACEY: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: In a word, with Jon Macey. And - but is - so that means that there's going to be a trading desk or several trading desks in New York that has been a private enterprise trading desk for years. It'll look the same. They'll have their Bloomberg terminals. And it'll be a bunch of, you know, guys - New York guys who are...

MACEY: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Long-term traders. But they are going to be official agents of the U.S. government?

MACEY: Right. They take off their green visors and put on their red, white and blue visors. And they are deputized, like the guys in the old western movies, as marshals or sheriffs or whatever of the U.S. government.

DAVIDSON: Wow. Does that trouble you?

MACEY: Well, the trouble is that it's kind of a revolving door, right? Because they're going to be sitting next to - they're going to be buying assets on behalf of the government, spending our money to buy these assets. But they're also going to be selling assets to the government.

DAVIDSON: The same guys?

MACEY: Well, maybe, or the guy sitting across from them. Or - that's what's not so clear. In other words, there is this - you know, they have to - this is what we're working out with the conflict of interest policy - we meaning the country, not me personally. You know, to what - because anyone that could conceivably be one of the people that's going to be buying up these assets, it's going to be somebody in the business, which by definition means they've got some of this toxic waste in their portfolios. So they're going to be looking to buy, and they're going to be looking to sell, which means they have every incentive to put these - make these prices pretty high.

CONAWAY: See, this brings us back, to me, to what has been one of the core problems in this whole debate, and that is that no one involved in it can agree on anyone else as a neutral actor. We look at Bernanke say, you know, you're working for Bush, not a neutral actor. We look at Paulson - you used to work for Goldman Sachs, not a neutral actor. And here we have the people who are carrying it out. Again, we question whether they can be neutral actors.

DAVIDSON: Now, I'm going to - so I'm now holding in my hand a different document. This is the interim guidelines for conflict of interest.

MACEY: Right.

DAVIDSON: And I got to say, I found this about as unimpressive as - I was surprised. So then we go down. And here's what - here's how we're going to solve it. Where appropriate, Treasury may obtain nondisclosure agreements and conflict of interest agreements in advance of supplying an offer.

CONAWAY: Nondisclosure by whom of what?

DAVIDSON: I think that means you have to sign a document saying if you find inside information that could make you millions of dollars, you shouldn't use it.

MACEY: You shouldn't use it. And you should set up - the idea here, which is not very well-articulated, is that you'll set up kind of secrecy walls or walls of confidentiality within these firms. So the people who are buying and, you know, have their formulas - who are buying for the government have formulas. And they don't share those with the other people in the firm who could use them to make a lot of money for the firm if they had that information.

DAVIDSON: How much could someone make if they really just said, hey, I'm going to go for it, I'm going to make a fortune off of this, if they decided to abuse their conflict of interest? Or...

MACEY: Oh, well, you know, we're talking about a lot of money, you know, certainly in the tens of millions, maybe in the - you know, I mean, without any sort of constraint whatsoever, I'd go probably in the hundreds of millions.

DAVIDSON: What's your gut sense or your professional expertise? Does signing a nondisclosure agreement mean, well, boy, I would take $100 million, but I guess I just can't - I signed that nondisclosure agreement?

MACEY: You know, in my view, it depends on, you know, the integrity of the person who's your counterparty because these things - there are a lot of honest people in the world. And they will sign these. And they'll understand the purpose and intent. And they will live up to the spirit of the document. There are a lot of other people, though, who aren't quite as upstanding and honest and don't have quite as much integrity. So you know - and these things are extremely difficult to monitor. And so it really depends on, you know, the good-faith efforts of the people you're dealing with, you know? How honest they are, how much integrity they have - very difficult to monitor.

DAVIDSON: That was Jon Macey of Yale Law School. We also talked to a money trader named Tom Corona. He works in lower Manhattan and keeps his eye carefully glued to the Bloomberg terminal to study what's happening in the credit markets, the markets that have been freezing up and causing so much panic. He's been following the moves in Europe over the weekend, the political moves. Now, he takes a different approach from Jon Macey. Jon Macey thinks Europe could learn a lot from the U.S. Well, Tom Corona goes the other way. He thinks America could learn a lot from Europe.

TOM CORONA: The Irish government last Tuesday came out with a plan to form a liquidity backstop for all of their five top banks and basically guaranteed all deposits, institutional and retail. So anybody depositing money in a money market fund at a bank or into a CD, the government guaranteed it.

DAVIDSON: So here we have that - right? - $100,000 per person. And then it was raised to 250,000.

CORONA: Correct. And what they've done to move liquidity along in the institutional side so lending would start is guaranteed all deposits for any dollar amount. And that's where the bulk of this money is lent, in the interbank market.

DAVIDSON: So they're saying, if you have $10 million in the bank, we're covering it?

CORONA: Correct. And institutionally, these banks take deposits, under normal circumstances, which we're not in right now, of 500 million to a billion on one trade. That's where the bulk of the liquidity is in the banking sector. There is none right now. It's all been short duration, one month and end. And the Danish banks and the German banking system followed their lead last night. And we're being told that Italy is close to follow. So we would expect all the EU member bank countries to provide some sort of liquidity backstop for their top money center banks. And then you'll probably have the U.K. follow, Canada, Japan and eventually the U.S. It just serves - why these other countries are following is if you have a choice to deposit $500 million in the EU and all of these major - remember, we're talking about the top 25 to 50 money center banks around the world.

DAVIDSON: And money center just means a major center of financial activity.

CORONA: Right. I mean, you know, you could take it for France, that would be BNP - Banque Nationale de Paris. For Italy, it would be Unicredito. For Australia, it would be Australia and New Zealand Bank. For the United States, you use Bank of America. I mean, these are all the top 25. And they all have branches in all the major money centers, whether it's London, New York.

DAVIDSON: Frankfurt.

MACEY: So if you're an investor and you want to just hide money in a safe CD and your choices out of these 25 banks, a bank that has a sovereign guarantee and one that doesn't, the other countries are going to be forced to follow this model. Otherwise, monies will eventually come out of their banks and into those banks.

CONAWAY: In the United States, when we face this credit crunch, we got everybody together and we argued about it for a couple weeks, and we passed this $700 billion bill that says we're going to buy up bad assets and we're maybe even going to buy some equity stake, some shares right in the banks themselves. In Europe, they're having a true financial crisis, and their response to it looks really quite different from ours.

MACEY: Oh, it is. It's completely different. And whether you agree with Paulson's initial plan, which I don't, I actually think the European model right now in the longer run is going to work out much better. They're not throwing massive amount of bailout money at the market. They're trying these liquidity facilities like the Fed is doing. And now, with this bank intervention, I really think, you know, that really costs nothing other than the government guaranteeing the deposits. Now, you can look at the banks and make sure, you know, the deposits are invested correctly and the money is held in safe assets as sort of treasury bills, what have you, similar products. But, you know, the banks really use these, you know, deposits and they make loans with them, and that's what gets the system working. And until the money starts to flow again, you know, they can buy all the distressed securities they want. Banks need to be lending 2a-7 funds, and money market funds need to be buying these assets again. And until that happens, nothing's going to change.

CONAWAY: So we're about to see two competing ways of solving a bank crisis side by side - the European way and the American way.

MACEY: Yeah, I think when it's all finished, you'll see the U.S. will have really not much of a choice but to also provide the same liquidity backstop because as the EU does this to all their banks, the U.K. is going to have no choice but to do it for their banks, and then Japan for theirs. And I just think it'll just, you know, bleed all the way down and eventually, U.S. will have to do the same. Otherwise, monies will leave the system and go to the larger European banks.

DAVIDSON: And finally, we called up listener David Griner of Birmingham, Ala. He had a good question.

DAVID GRINER: Today, Jim Cramer got quite a bit of attention for coming out and saying on "The Today Show" that people should sell all the stocks, that if they think they'll need the money in the next five years, they should sell off all their stocks. He was very thorough, and he specifically was talking about stocks. But I guess my question is first, is he right? And second, isn't this really a perfect example of yelling fire in a crowded theater that we've been hearing so much not to be doing?

CONAWAY: Adam?

DAVIDSON: Well, so first off, I'm going to say, as I always do, we are not a personal finance show. We do not give personal financial advice. And, you know...

CONAWAY: You wouldn't want it if we gave it.

DAVIDSON: And yeah, you wouldn't want it if we gave it. We work for public radio. Look, I would say, you know, what most - I've read a million personal finance books. I've talked to a lot of experts on it. Stocks as a general rule, no matter what's going on in the market, should not be a place where you have your money that you need in the next few years, three to five years. As a general rule, stocks, you should give stocks some time to deal with rapid ups and downs. My understanding is in the history of stocks in the U.S., there have been five-year periods and I believe a few 10-year periods where stocks have gone down for that period of time. My understating is there has never been a 15-year period or a 20-year period where stocks have gone down. They've always gone up when you give them that long. So in my case - I'm 38 - I'm just putting my money in the - personally, I'm not making this as advice. I'm just telling you what I'm doing. I'm putting my money in my 401(k) - or in our case, 403(b) because we're not for profit - every paycheck and, you know, I'm actually very happy that I'm buying stocks at a discount these days. That makes me - that makes me happy.

I think as a general rule, no matter what's happening in the market, if you really know you're going to need that money in the next three to five years, you know, it might make sense not to have them in the stock market. When markets go way down, people panic, and they sell like crazy.

CONAWAY: Is Jim Cramer helping them panic?

DAVIDSON: Yes. Jim Cramer, in my view, is helping them panic. I think that a reasonable plan, a reasonable portfolio would be one that has some more conservative investments and more aggressive investments, something to work out with your personal finance advisor, and it should be based on your age and your, you know, your sort of comfort level and your goals. But the general idea that the market has just lost in the last week, you know, whatever it is, I don't have...

CONAWAY: Fifteen-thousand million or something.

DAVIDSON: I think it's 15,000 million points, and you're going to sell now and wait until it's going up? I mean, that's just a recipe to sell low and buy high. I mean, come on. That's never a good idea. And - all right, I'm just going to come out and say it. Don't listen to Jim Cramer.

Thanks for the question, David Griner. That is the PLANET MONEY podcast for today, October 6. Send us your questions and let us know if you'd like us to call you. We're at npr.org/money. You can also send us emails at planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Adam Davidson here with Laura Conaway.

CONAWAY: Take care.

DAVIDSON: Take care.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "EVERY SINGLE LINE MEANS SOMETHING")

MARNIE STERN: (Singing) And then it comes to me that every single line means something. You see, it's up to me to drag myself into the ocean. And then you come to me. You come to push down on our shoulders. You say that one is three and no one makes it up and over. And then you wonder why, why everything falls. And then you wonder why, why everything falls.

Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
I'm here, of course, with Laura Conaway.
Tough day out there.
Sure was.
Guys, today is Monday, October 6th.
It is now 6.02 p.m.
In New York.
In New York.
That clip you just heard was from Representative Betty McCollum of Minnesota, giving it really

Meanwhile, it has been an ugly day for stock investors, that's for sure.
The stock fell 800 points before skirting upwards again and ending 360 points down.
I generally don't like talking about the Dow Jones special average, not my favorite
index.
I don't think it's the most useful, but a day like today where it falls below 10,000
and goes back to its 1999 level, it's hard not to talk about it, isn't it, Laura?
Everywhere was down.
Asian markets were down sort of similar levels.
In Europe it was really ugly after a weekend of just grim economic news and a total
failure of the European countries to reach a unified approach to solving the crisis.
Stocks there fell far more than they fell here, 9% in France.
That's a lot.
John Macy is deputy dean of the Yale Law School.
He's the deputy to the dean, I guess, is that what that means?
He's kind enough to walk us through today's events.
First off, I just want to jump in since it is the thing in the news.
We're talking at 420, so the New York Stock Exchange just closed.
For the people who haven't seen it, it was a pretty gruesome day for stock markets

We had a horrible day here in New York, but as you were saying, we actually had
a good day compared to some other foreign stock markets.
Yeah, I mean, it is incredible that we have caught a cold here in the U.S.
and it seems to be giving the Europeans pneumonia.
I think that the reason for that is that as disorganized and disjointed as the U.S.
response was, has been to our financial crisis, there's much less optimism even
about the Europeans' ability to launch a sort of concerted governmental response on
a European as opposed to a country-wide basis.
Wasn't the European Union supposed to make responding to this kind of thing easier?
Well, the problem that we have in Europe is that, well, the short answer is yes.

And in my view, fiscal policy and monetary policy, that's jargon.
That's not something people who aren't deputy deans necessarily know.
And I'm going to take the lead on this.
Monetary policy is what the Fed does, what Ben Bernanke in this case does,
and Alan Greenspan used to do.
And to cut it down to the bare minimum, it's basically they get to decide
how much money there is.
And fiscal policy...
Wait a minute. How much money there is?
That means they move the interest rates up and down, right?
Correct.
But the process by which they move it up and down, they actually put more
money into the market or take more money out of the market.
OK. Fiscal policy.
What they do by their actions, they expand and contract the money supply.
That's exactly right.
Right. Now let's do fiscal policy.
Now, fiscal policy...
Fiscal policy in a word is tax.
Yes.
And in another word are...
Spending.
...is spending and in modern fiscal policy is spending ceiling.
So we would have been unable to, you know, we would have been
unable to do this Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008
without raising the amount of money, raising the size of the U.S.
budget deficit.
Right. You almost talked about monetary policy.
We were talking about fiscal policy.
Right.
So the Central Bank can't do that in Europe.
The Central Banks, you know, you need the treasuries in all these
countries to act in a concerted way.
They don't have a single institution that can do what our Treasury did,
which is basically blow the roof off spending.
Right. So in the U.S., you can actually see Ben Bernanke and
Henry Paulson.
Normally, these two jobs would be very separate.
You'd want to keep them separate.
I mean, they coordinate from time to time.
But the idea is that the Central Bank will be the Fed will be an
independent of politics organization.
And the Treasury Secretary is obviously a political appointee.
I mean, I guess the Fed chairman is too, but let's not get into that.
Whereas in Europe, the Ben Bernanke of Europe is Jean-Claude
Trichet at the European Central Bank.
He sort of is in charge of all the euro.
So he oversees the money of all the eurozone.
But then each country has their own Henry Paulson, their own finance
minister, and each country decides on how much they're going to tax people,
what sort of internal budget deficit each country is going to run and
and whether, you know, that'll be expanded or contracted.
That's done separately from the European Central Bank.
Great. So that's what's got you scared.
The fact that they are not responding in a unified way.
Right. It's just going to take them longer to coordinate.
It's kind of ironic because the political will there, the disposition
towards activist intervention is actually much greater.
But the transaction cost of getting everyone together is also higher.
So you have you have the, you know, in a way, a greater will
and consensus ideologically than you have in the US.
But but it's much, you know, who's going to pay?
What is a very difficult question and getting French and German
and Italian finance ministers to all agree.
Right. Exactly. That's tough.
All right. Let's move to what I'm holding in my hand,
which is process for selecting asset managers,
the interim guidelines for conflict of interest.
Basically, what I'm talking about is what the Treasury Department issued today.
This is their the most we've learned yet
on how they are going to spend our seven hundred billion dollars.
I count in total one, two, three, four, five, six pages,
although two are pretty small.
So I'm going to call it five pages.
That that's not what you normally expect in a government report.
Five pages. No, no.
But, you know, we're moving fast here.
The original bailout plan itself, which blossomed into about
four hundred and eighty pages, started out at three.
So I'm sure this will have the same
they will say the same.
That's this will apply to this.
What are you seeing in there?
Well, you know, it's exactly no surprises.
You know, basically, they're going to be a bunch of people
in the business on Wall Street who are going to,
you know, be buying up on behalf as agent for the government.
Wait, wait, I want to stop you right there.
That that was one of the sentences that grabbed my eye.
This is the third paragraph.
Financial agents, asset managers will be financial agents
of the United States and not contractors.
That seems like a very important distinction,
but I don't understand that.
OK, so the basic idea, in other words, is that these people
will be part of the government. Right.
So in other words, if you think about somebody who does work
for the government, they can either be in independent contractors
or they can be agents performing work directly
on behalf of the government.
And these people are in the latter category.
What does that mean?
So this is going to be a guy
does that mean they all work in D.C. and they get no.
No, it's illegal.
It basically means that that I can't sue them.
Exactly. Hey, I like this in a word business.
Yeah, this is very helpful.
In a word with John Macy and but is so that means that
there's going to be a trading desk or several trading desks in New York
that has been a private enterprise trading desk for years.
It'll look the same.
They'll have their Bloomberg terminals and it'll be a bunch of,
you know, guys, New York guys or long term traders.
But they are going to be official agents of the U.S. government.
Right. They take off their green visors and put on a red, white
and blue visors, and they are deputized like the guys
in the old Western movies as marshals or sheriffs
or whatever of the U.S. government.
Wow. Is that does that trouble you?
Well, the trouble is that it's kind of a revolving door, right?
Because they're going to be sitting next to Pete.
They're going to be buying assets
on behalf of the government, spending our money to buy these assets.
But they're also going to be selling assets to the government.
The same guys.
Well, maybe or the guy sitting across from them.
Or that's what not so clear.
In other words, there is this, you know, they have to.
This is what we're working out with a conflict of interest policy.
We meaning the country, not me personally.
You know, to what?
Because anyone that could conceivably be one of the people
that's going to be buying up these assets is going to be somebody
in the business, which by definition means they've got some of this toxic
waste in their portfolios.
So they're going to be looking to buy and they're going to be looking to sell,
which means they have every incentive to put these make these prices pretty high.
See, this brings us back to me to what has been one of the core
problems in this whole debate.
And that is that no one involved in it can agree on anyone else as a neutral actor.
We look at Bernanke say, you know, you're working for Bush, not a neutral actor.
We look at Paulson used to work for Goldman Sachs, not a neutral actor.
And here we have the people who are carrying it out.
Again, we question whether they can be neutral actors.
Now, I'm going to say I'm now holding in my hand a different document.
This is the interim guidelines for conflict of interest.
And I can say I found this about as unimpressive as as as
I was surprised.
So then we go down and here's what here's how we're going to solve it.
Where appropriate, Treasury may obtain non-disclosure agreements
and conflict of interest agreements in advance of supplying an offer.
Non-disclosure by whom of what?
I think that means you have to sign a document saying
if you find inside information that could make you millions of dollars,
you shouldn't use it.
You shouldn't use it and you should set up
the idea here that's not very well articulated is that you'll set up
kind of secrecy walls or walls of confidentiality within these firms.
So the people who are buying and, you know, have their formulas,
who are buying for the government, have formulas,
and they don't share those with the other people in the firm
who could use them to make a lot of money for the firm
if they had that information.
How much could someone make if they really just said, hey,
I'm going to go for it, I'm going to make a fortune off of this
if they decided to abuse their conflict of interest or?
Oh, well, you know, we're talking about a lot of money, you know,
certainly in the in the tens of millions, maybe in the, you know,
I mean, without any sort of constraint whatsoever,
I'd go probably in the hundreds of millions.
What is what's your gut sense or your professional expertise?
Does does signing a non-disclosure agreement mean, well, boy,
I would I would take 100 million dollars, but I guess I just can't.
I signed that non-disclosure agreement.
You know, in in my view, it it depends on, you know,
the integrity of the person who's your counterparty,
because these things, there are a lot of honest people in the world
and they will sign these and they'll understand the purpose and intent
and they will live up to the spirit of the document.
There are a lot of other people who aren't quite as as upstanding
and and honest and don't have quite as much integrity.
So, you know, and these things are extremely difficult to monitor.
And and so it really depends on, you know, the good faith efforts
of the people you're dealing with, you know, how how how honest they are,
how much integrity they have, very difficult to monitor.
That was John Macy of Yale Law School.
We also talked to a money trader named Tom Corona.
He works in Lower Manhattan and keeps his eye carefully
glued to the Bloomberg terminal to study what's happening in the credit
markets, the markets that have been freezing up and causing so much panic.
He's been following the moves in Europe over the weekend, the political moves.
Now, he he takes a different approach from John Macy.
John Macy thinks Europe could learn a lot from the US.
Well, Tom Corona goes the other way.
He thinks America could learn a lot from Europe.
The Irish government last Tuesday came out with a plan
to form a liquidity backstop for all of their five top banks
and basically guaranteed all deposits, institutional and retail.
So anybody depositing money in a money market fund at a bank
or as into a CD, the government guaranteed it.
So here we have that right.
One hundred thousand dollars per person.
And then it was raised to two hundred and fifty thousand.
Correct. And what they've done to move liquidity along
in the institutional side, so lending would start, is guaranteed
all deposits for any dollar amount.
And that's where the bulk of this money is lent in the interbank market.
So they're saying if you have ten million dollars in the bank, we're covering it.
Correct. And institutionally, these banks take deposits
under normal circumstances, which we're not in right now,
of five hundred million to a billion on one trade.
That's where the bulk of liquidity is in the banking sector.
There is none right now.
It's all been short duration, one month and in.
And the Danish banks and the German banking system
followed their lead last night.
And we're being told that Italy is close to follow.
So we would expect all the EU member bank countries
to provide some sort of liquidity backstop for their top money
center banks. And then you'll probably have the UK follow
Canada, Japan and eventually the U.S.
And it just serves why these other bank, the countries are following
is if you have a choice to deposit five hundred million dollars
in in the EU and all of these major Internet.
Remember, we're talking about the top 25 to 50 money center
banks around the world.
And money center just means a major center of financial activity.
I mean, if you take it for France, that would be BNP,
BNP, for Italy would be Unicredito,
for Australia would be Australia, New Zealand Bank, United States.
You use Bank of America.
I mean, these are all the top 25.
And they all have branches in all the major money centers,
whether it's London, New York, Frankfurt.
If you're an investor and you want to just hide money in a safe CD
and your choices out of these 25 banks, a bank that has a sovereign
guarantee and one that doesn't,
the other countries are going to be forced to follow this model.
Otherwise, monies will eventually come out of their banks
and into those banks.
In the United States, when we face this credit crunch,
we got everybody together and we argued about it for a couple of weeks.
And we passed the seven hundred billion dollar bill that says
we're going to buy up bad assets and we're maybe even going to buy
some equity stakes and shares right in the banks themselves.
In Europe, they're having a true financial crisis
and their response to it looks really quite different from ours.
Oh, it is. It's completely different.
And whether you agree with Paulson's initial plan, which I don't,
I actually think the European model right now in the longer run
is going to work out much better.
They're not throwing massive amount of bailout money at the market.
They're trying these liquidity facilities like the Fed is doing.
And now with this bank intervention,
I really think that that really costs nothing
other than the government guaranteeing the deposits.
Now, you can look at the banks and make sure, you know,
the deposits are invested correctly and the money is held in safe assets
as sort of Treasury bills or what have you, similar products.
But, you know, the banks really use these deposits
and they make loans with them.
And that's what gets the system working.
And until the money starts to flow again,
you know, they can buy all the distress securities they want.
Banks need to be lending to a seven funds
and money market funds need to be buying these assets again.
And until that happens, nothing's going to change.
So we're about to see two competing ways of solving a bank crisis
side by side, the European way and the American way.
You know, I think when it's all finished, you'll see
the US will have really not much of a choice,
but to also provide the same liquidity backstop,
because as the EU does this to all their banks,
the UK is going to have no choice but to do it for their banks
and then Japan for theirs.
And I just think it'll just, you know, bleed all the way down.
And eventually, the US will have to do the same.
Otherwise, monies will lead the system and go to the larger
European banks.
And finally, we called up listener David Griner of Birmingham, Alabama.
He had a good question.
Today, Jim Kramer got quite a bit of attention for coming out
and saying on the Today Show that people should sell all the stocks
that if they think they'll need the money in the next five years,
they should sell off all their stocks.
He is very thorough and he specifically was talking about stocks.
But I guess my question is, first, is he right?
And second, isn't this really a perfect example of
yelling fire in a crowded theater that we've been hearing so much
not to be doing? Adam?
Well, so first off, I'm going to say, as I always do,
we are not a personal finance show.
We do not give personal financial advice.
And you wouldn't want it if we gave it.
And yeah, you wouldn't want it if you gave it.
We work for public radio.
Look, I would say, you know, what most I've read,
a million personal finance books.
I've talked to a lot of experts on it.
Stocks is a general rule, no matter what's going on in the market
should not be a place where you have your money that you need
in the next few years, three to five years as a general rule.
Stocks, you should give stocks some time
to deal with rapid ups and downs.
My understanding is in the history of stocks in the US,
there have been five year periods
and I believe a few 10 year periods where stocks have gone down
for that period of time.
My understanding is there has never been a 15 year period
or a 20 year period where stocks have gone down.
They've always gone up when you give them that long.
So in my case, I'm 38.
I'm just putting my money in the personally,
I'm not making this as advice.
I'm just telling you what I'm doing.
I'm putting my money in my 401k or in our case,
403b because we're not for profit every paycheck.
I'm actually very happy that I'm buying stocks at a discount these days.
That makes me happy.
I think as a general rule, no matter what's happening in the market,
if you really know you're going to need that money
in the next three to five years,
it might make sense not to have them in the stock market.
When markets go way down, people panic and they sell like crazy.
Is Jim Cramer helping them panic?
Yes, Jim Cramer, in my view, is helping them panic.
I think that a reasonable plan, a reasonable portfolio would be one
that has some more conservative investments and more aggressive investments,
something to work out with your personal finance advisor
and it should be based on your age and your sort of comfort level
and your goals.
But the general idea that the market has just lost in the last week,
whatever it is, I don't have a 15,000 million points
and you're going to sell now and wait until it's going up.
I mean, that's just a recipe to sell low and buy high.
I mean, come on, that's never a good idea.
All right, I'm just going to come out and say it.
Don't listen to Jim Cramer.
Thanks for the question, David Griner.
