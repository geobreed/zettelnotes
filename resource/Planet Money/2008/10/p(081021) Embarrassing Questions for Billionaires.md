(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

STEVEN LATOURETTE: We talk about greed. We talk about lack of regulation or poor regulation. We talk about people overborrowing, buying houses that had no reason buying houses. But doesn't it offend your sensibility, I guess, that all this bailout has to come from the private - the public sector at this moment in time?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hi, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson. Ignore the music. We are still in a financial crisis.

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

Yeah, maybe even a recession.

DAVIDSON: Hi, Laura Conaway.

CONAWAY: Hi. Today's Tuesday, October 21. It's about 4:29 p.m. here in New York City. And we've got a great show today, including what Adam calls the most embarrassing question he ever asked a billionaire and the billionaire's answer.

DAVIDSON: Well, now it's time for the PLANET MONEY indicators. The TED spread has really continued to fall. This is what we've been hoping to see. This is our main indicator these days - the measure of how money is moving through the global economy from bank to bank, how nervous the global economy is. It is down well below 32.74 today. That's a more than 8% fall from yesterday. We always go every day now to Tradition Asiel Securities. They're our friends on the frontlines of the credit crisis. We usually go to Will Aston-Reese or Tom Corona. Both of them are out right now, but John Chirico has very generously picked up their baton. Hey, John.

JOHN CHIRICO: Hi. How are you guys?

DAVIDSON: Good, good. So we check with you guys, Tradition Asiel, every day. You are where - you are this credit crisis. I mean, you are right on the front lines. Normally, in normal times, banks will use you guys to borrow and lend billions of dollars every day. For the last - since September 15, basically, it's been completely frozen - no lending at all.

On Friday, we were hearing rumors of some other trading desks beginning to see a thaw in this credit freeze. Yesterday, I think you guys moved a few hundred million, not a huge amount for you - certainly a huge amount for me, but not for you. And so, John, how did today go? Is the ice...

CHIRICO: Well...

DAVIDSON: ...Continuing to thaw?

CHIRICO: Yeah, well, actually, we've seen - you know, from what - we look at it as another step hopefully in the corrective phase, and hopefully, this will continue. The Fed basically today announced a plan where they're going to create a new facility to ease the stress - you know, the continued stress in the short-term debt market. You know, they'll provide funds to be used in an effort controlled by the private sector just to purchase, you know, all types of money market instruments, you know, to help relieve some of the stress in the money market industry in general. With LIBOR, opened up around - three-month LIBOR opened up about 3.83. Projected three-month LIBOR tomorrow is closer to the three - you know, 50, 3.55 range.

You know, and we've seen some money invested today from, you know, one months - in the one-month sector out to the six-month sector. And, you know, to me, that's another positive step of getting this market, you know, to some sort of, you know, normal state. You know, we still have a long way to go. But we did see, you know, potentially upwards of, you know, a billion or better invested. Predominantly, there's three - I'd say three months, four months, five months...

DAVIDSON: So that's a big deal. That...

CHIRICO: ...Six months. So, yeah, it was a definite - you know, a hope, a definite hope, a definite step in the right direction, I think, for all of us, seeing some interbank lending and some natural buyers come into the market as well with both CDs - Yankee CD buying both and deposit lenders.

DAVIDSON: Wow. Well, that's great news, John, but not back to where we were before September 15th.

CHIRICO: No, no, correct. That's - I still think it's a work in progress. It's going to take a little time. And hopefully, you know, the continued measures by the Fed is going to help ease this process. You know, they continue to try to, you know, pump liquidity back into the system and do whatever it, you know, takes. So we're all hoping here that that's going to be the case going forward, you know, as we gradually get back to some sort of normal consistency in the market.

DAVIDSON: Great? John Chirico, a trader with Tradition Asiel Securities, talking to him - he's in Lower Manhattan really on the front lines of the credit crisis although these front lines happen to be, like, a nice office with a comfortable chair in front of a bunch of computer screens. But still, he is right where this crisis is happening. John, thanks so much.

CHIRICO: OK. Thank you.

DAVIDSON: Take care.

CHIRICO: Have a good day. Goodbye.

DAVIDSON: And he was talking about that Fed move this morning. I just want to talk about that real quick because I think that's the biggest development of the day. This is something we've heard a lot about on PLANET MONEY. Our buddies Will and Tom down there have been calling for this for a long time. You have these money market funds. You and I talked about this yesterday on the podcast.

CONAWAY: Yeah. They were saying that no one wants to buy this commercial paper, the short-term, overnight, big IOUs because they don't think they can turn around and sell them if they need to.

DAVIDSON: Right. If you're a money market mutual fund, which is basically, like, a fancy, high-earning savings account, you need to be ready to give people money if they ask for their money. And the fear is that you'll lend a billion dollars to another bank, get this IOU in return, but tomorrow, some of your customers say, hey, I want my money, and you can't sell that IOU because nobody else wants to lend money to banks because it's too risky. So now, the Federal Reserve has said, hey, don't worry. If you can't sell it, we'll take care of it. We'll make sure that - we'll buy it for you, basically.

It's more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea. It's what Tom and Will have been calling for on the blog. I pointed out that Will is a little troubled with some of the details. But it seems to be, from what John has just been telling us, that it has had at least the beginning of the desired effect.

CONAWAY: I think it's interesting because the Federal Reserve earlier came in and said, we will now offer commercial paper. We will now make the loans, if need be, to businesses who can't get them. Now, they're also saying we'll buy them back up.

DAVIDSON: Yes. This today is yet another massive expansion of the role of the Federal Reserve and the central bank of the U.S. And this - today's announcement, if it just plopped down in the middle of a normal time, you know, three years ago or something, it would be, like, the biggest news of the century in - at least in central banking terms. But it would be huge transformation of the role of the central bank in the U.S. economy.

Of course, every day for the last few weeks, we've been having massive transformations of the role of the central bank, so this is just one more step. It's a subtle one. It's one that very few people will notice. But this is really important. This means that, basically, the U.S. - the Federal Reserve is absorbing the risk of our financial system.

CONAWAY: For everybody on all sides of these investments.

DAVIDSON: Exactly.

CONAWAY: You know, I've actually started dreaming about the economy.

DAVIDSON: That is disturbing.

CONAWAY: Yeah, it's - I think it does kind of get to you. I got a listener question today about something that's in the news, and I just flat couldn't answer it. The question comes from Eli Naduris-Weissman of Washington, D.C.

ELI NADURIS-WEISSMAN: I've been hearing a lot about these ideas of auctions being used to deal with the financial crisis. I heard about the auctions for the Lehman credit default swap, and I'm just wondering, what are these auctions? How do they work? How do you determine values from an auction? And are we going to be hearing a lot about this? Is this a good thing? Just want to understand.

CONAWAY: Eli, I am so with you. I want to know exactly what these auctions are.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I feel like I've heard the word auction more in the last few weeks than at any point in my life. So we called my friend Hampton Finer. I went to Stuyvesant High School with him, but he's now grown-up and is the deputy superintendent of the New York State Department of Insurance. Hey, Hampton.

HAMPTON FINER: How are you doing, Adam?

DAVIDSON: All right. How are you?

FINER: Great.

DAVIDSON: Great. Well, you've become a real expert in credit default swaps, and we actually have an extended conversation with you that we're going to play later this week. But I wanted to sneak in under the gun 'cause I thought Eli's question was a great one and wanted you to help us understand.

So when we hear about an auction in the financial market setting, I mean, should we be picturing, like, a big hall and there's a guy with a gavel and there's a bunch of people with, like, things with numbers on them holding them up saying, I'll take it at 3 million, I'll take it at 4 million?

FINER: There's an electronic version of that. Absolutely. There are buyers and sellers, and they bid certain amounts that they're willing to pay and ask certain amounts that they're willing to accept. And there's a electronic system and a computer program that matches up those bids and works out what we call in economics a market clearing price. And real bonds are being sold at these auctions.

DAVIDSON: So it's not - everyone's not in one place. They're in their office typing...

FINER: All over the world.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

FINER: The auction itself actually takes place in London. I'm not sure exactly why, but it takes place in London.

CONAWAY: Could anyone take part? Or do you have to have a special license?

FINER: No, I mean, you have to be part of - you could take part through your dealer, certainly. But only dealers are allowed to participate. But there may be lots of hedge funds and other investors that are participating through their dealers.

CONAWAY: And there's one going on today for Lehman Brothers?

FINER: No, the Lehman one took place last week. The next one will be for WaMu, for Washington Mutual. But the auction itself took place last week. Today, the trades settle for Lehman's CDS. Last week, they set the prices. Today, the money changes hands.

DAVIDSON: OK, so last week, the buyers bid for whatever they wanted to pay. The people who had them agreed to accept that price. It came in at something like - on average, something like 8 cents on the dollar or something really low?

FINER: About 8.5 cents on the dollar, that's correct.

DAVIDSON: Right. So today, they're actually trading hands. Now...

FINER: Yeah, today, they actually pay. So people who sold protection will have to give about 91 - a little more than 91 cents on the dollar, 91.5 cents on the dollar to people who bought protection. And in exchange, well, that will be the terms of the exchange for cash-settled CDS's. So...

DAVIDSON: So if I happen to buy a bond from Lehman Brothers and I own it and it's, like, a hundred-dollar bond, and I got a little nervous maybe a year ago that Lehman Brothers might go out of business, I might have called you, Hampton, and said, hey, I want to buy protection, which is basically almost like a form of insurance. And I would say to you, I'm going to give you a couple bucks a year, and then you get to keep that couple bucks. But if Lehman defaults, if they go bankrupt or - and my bond is suddenly worth a lot less or nothing, you have promised to make me whole, to give me...

FINER: Well, I promise to give you that a hundred dollars, and you've, in return, promised to give me the bond.

DAVIDSON: Right.

FINER: Of course, when Lehman defaults, the bond is going to be worth a lot less than the hundred dollars I'm going to give you.

DAVIDSON: Right. So - and that's basically where we are now. The only question is - we knew the bonds were worth less than a hundred dollars, but we didn't know how much less.

FINER: Exactly. I mean, you needed to have a reliable mechanism for price discovery and to determine what the true value of those bonds were. Interestingly, going into the auction, there were people that thought those bonds might be worth a little bit more, like 12 cents instead of 8, so...

DAVIDSON: And can I just ask a dumb question? I mean, if a company goes bankrupt, why would their bonds have any value? I mean...

FINER: Well, you know, they have assets, and there's going to be some degree of recovery. I mean, they weren't utterly without assets. It was just - you know, a bankruptcy means you don't have enough resources to pay your current debts. But there certainly are assets in a company. They have a building in Midtown. They had a lot - you know, a big portfolio of other assets. They had companies that they're able to sell. So there's going to be some recovery value to the enterprise. And the bondholders, the senior bondholders, are the first people to get that money.

DAVIDSON: I see. And we don't know what that recovery is yet. We don't know what they're going to sell the building for or whatever. And so basically, the auction allows - you know, you hear this phrase, the wisdom of the crowd. It basically allows the global investor class to place bets on how much value they think these things are going to be worth.

FINER: Absolutely. I mean, there's a very liquid market in Lehman's debt even though they're no longer in a position to pay principal and interest. Because once the enterprise is liquidated, there'll presumably be some recovery.

DAVIDSON: So whoever...

FINER: That's what this auction simulated, that marketplace.

DAVIDSON: Got you. So whoever paid 8.5 half cents or 9 cents, presumably, they believe that these bonds one day will be worth more than that. And whoever sold it believes they won't be. And - but that's the price, where those two sides kind of met.

FINER: Exactly. And there is a very explicit market-clearing mechanism that makes sure that all the people that want the bonds can buy them and all the people that want to sell them can sell them at whatever the auction price is.

DAVIDSON: So Eli's final question was, we're hearing all about all these auctions. Are they a good thing? I'm getting the strong sense from you - yes, these are a good thing.

FINER: I think that they're the best way, or at least a very effective way, of discovering what the actual price ought to be without a lot of the imperfections that might exist in the larger bond market. It's this very - it's kind of a laboratory for price discovery. That's been very effective. There's been 14, I believe, of these auctions so far in - to settle CDS.

DAVIDSON: Since this crisis began.

FINER: No, no, for - ever.

DAVIDSON: Ever. OK. Great (ph).

FINER: Very few - there are very few default events, and the auction process is relatively new.

CONAWAY: Thanks, Eli Naduris-Weissman, for asking that impossible question and, Hampton Finer, for answering. I'm starting to get it. Adam, could you just lighten this thing up a little bit?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, let's lighten things up. And by the way, I think PLANET MONEY - we try and make everything clear in one step. But some of these things, like the CDS, it's so complicated. Stick with it. You're going to get it.

CONAWAY: OK.

DAVIDSON: This stuff is seeping into your - you know, into your brain.

CONAWAY: Yes, clearly.

DAVIDSON: And, you know, this is complicated stuff. We have a crisis that is complicated, and we're doing our best to make it clear. Sometimes, it's easier than other times. Mike Pesca, you know - sits right next - he actually sits between us.

CONAWAY: Yes.

DAVIDSON: Poor guy...

CONAWAY: Yep.

DAVIDSON: ...Since we're yelling at each other all day...

CONAWAY: (Laughter).

DAVIDSON: ...In a friendly way. We're just calling out to each other all day.

CONAWAY: Yes.

DAVIDSON: And there's Mike Pesca in the middle. He is NPR's sports reporter and our good friend. And he has been trying to get me on the phone with this guy for weeks. He's obsessed with this guy 'cause he really straddles the world of sports and finance.

CONAWAY: Yeah? Who?

DAVIDSON: All right. I'm embarrassed to say. I hadn't heard of him.

CONAWAY: OK.

DAVIDSON: Is that horrible? Mark Cuban? He's...

CONAWAY: I've heard of him.

DAVIDSON: You've heard of him?

CONAWAY: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: I've heard the name. I didn't really know who he was. He's the owner of the Dallas Mavericks. He also owns HDNet, the cable network. He made billions of dollars, literally - I think Mike said 2.8 billion at last count - from broadcast.com. And he also has this pretty awesome blog, blogmaverick.com, and some other blogs that he's associated with. So Pesca and I called him to see what he has to say about the financial crisis.

So, Mark, I wanted to - before we get into the various topics - this might be, like, the most embarrassing question I've ever asked, but I've - you are the third billionaire I've talked to, and here's what I want to ask. I mean, for me, when I look at my stock portfolio, that - I mean, that's going to determine how I - what kind of life I have, you know?

MARK CUBAN: Mmm hmm.

DAVIDSON: And I'm young enough that it's OK, but my parents, you know, it means it changes their retirement picture. When you're sort of in the world where you're going to have a good life no matter what happens and you're - you know, you sound happy that you - which is - I totally get it. I'm a big believer in market incentives and all of that. You know, you're glad that you made smart choices that got you more money. I bet you'd be upset if you lost money. But is it - what is it at that point when it doesn't actually affect you anymore? Is it just keeping score? Is it an intellectual...

CUBAN: Yeah, you know, I'm a very, very competitive person. So money is a unique way to keep score. But I got to tell you, I think a lot of people that get financially to my level try to define themselves by their bank accounts. And, you know, don't you know who I am because of how much money I have? And, you know, I'm the exact opposite. I - you know, I look at myself as the luckiest guy in the world, and I just try to have fun. And, you know, the money (laughter) definitely facilitates that. And so, you know, I had fun before. I have more fun now.

MIKE PESCA, BYLINE: But I guess the question is, there's not - if you lost half a billion dollars, there's still nothing that you couldn't do because of that, I assume. I mean, you could do whatever you want at your current level, and...

CUBAN: Yeah, I think you're right.

PESCA: Yeah.

CUBAN: I mean, look, I'm not going to be limited by my finances and the choices I make. You know, I mean, I'm not going to buy a fleet of 57, 67s. You know, there are limits, I guess.

PESCA: Yeah.

CUBAN: But, you know, within the normal, day-to-day life, there's nothing that I'm going to be limited by. And, you know, look, there's other people. Just - all you have to do is look at the financial markets these days. You know, Aubrey McClendon, who had to sell all his shares in Chesapeake - there are people who have been wiped out. And so, you know, the flip side of all this is that you can't get greedy. You can't, you know, want more and more and more because, you know, if you're just squeezing for the next basis point or squeezing for the next dollars, and you take on leverage and those types of things, you put yourself at risk. And, you know, there's just no reason to risk everything to get anything more.

PESCA: I want to get to Blog Maverick, which is your blog. And normally, it's just about whatever's going on in the world or occurring to you. Lately, it's been all about economics, which is a reflection of the national mood. You have a lot of interesting proposals on Blog Maverick. Let's go over a couple of them.

CUBAN: Sure.

PESCA: One was - there's this issue of mark-to-market accounting, which - I mean, maybe Adam could define it a little bit easier. I've - as I understand, it is these banks have these assets, and no one really knows what they're worth, so the government says, hey, put a price tag on it. And they do, but no one really knows if that price tag is accurate. They're kind of guessing.

CUBAN: Right.

PESCA: So you had a solution for this, which was what?

CUBAN: Well, I mean, the market is all about transparency. And, you know, we should - if you don't have enough information as a CFO of a bank or a controller of a bank, well, just publish the data because the market - you know, the people who are around the market will give you data - enough data to make a decision. And so, you know, my suggestion was based off of the fact that banks are going to need bailed out and need capital infusions. Rather than just leaving it to business as usual, if you're taking taxpayer money, you should be publishing all the data about all the assets you have. And, you know, by making that data transparent, you'll be in a better position to determine the market valuations of what you own. And not only that, you'll be in a better position to possibly sell it at a better price than you might otherwise be able to get.

DAVIDSON: And I guess the banks would say, well, wait a second, Mark, that's our proprietary information. We don't want to reveal all the secrets we have on our - you know, the investments we have, what exposure we have. Some of the...

PESCA: If we have Boo Radley chained up in our financial dungeon.

DAVIDSON: Right.

CUBAN: Yes, yes. Right. And I would say that's fine, but don't take taxpayer money, and you're on your own.

DAVIDSON: Right, and then you're going to collapse. Yeah.

PESCA: Another interesting idea is something called ETFs, which are - they're sort of like stocks. They trade on the market, but they're a collection of, like, a closed-end fund, which is...

CUBAN: Well, actually, they're not closed-end, but...

PESCA: Right.

CUBAN: ...That's the key differential, you know? What I suggested was if the government is going to be buying these assets, any assets, they're obviously having to take money from the Treasury and either print it or borrow it through Treasury bills, etc., and then give that money to banks and others who own these non-performing assets. Well, once they've purchased whatever it is they're going to buy at whatever price they're going to buy it at, then it goes into that government abyss that we never know anything more about. And I think that's going to create big problems. And even if it makes money for them, like everybody's suggesting, we'll never really know because it goes into the general Treasury. And, you know, who keeps track of anything once it gets to that point?

And what I suggested was to say, look; you can identify the assets that you're going to buy whether they're homes, condos, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt. Whatever it is, identify it and package them together into an electronically traded fund. And what happens then is everybody on Wall Street or any individual, institution, fund, whatever, will have the opportunity to buy shares in that fund. So if the Treasury, as an example, spends $250 billion for assets and they post all those assets in an asset listing for the fund, then all three of us can go in there and buy, you know - and they'll pick just whatever share price. They'll say, it's $200 billion. There are 10 billion shares and they're $20 apiece. And then you - any of us can go in there and actually purchase the shares. And the shares that are purchased at $20 per share goes right into the Treasury to offset what was spent by - through the taxpayers.

And so then, all of a sudden, if there really is a good market for these, Wall Street is going to recognize that, hey, these shares are either undervalued or overvalued and the price will fluctuate through the real value of the assets. The important element there is twofold. One, each of us as individuals can participate so that if we recognize that this really is a good deal, we'll want parts of it. And we'll buy our shares. And those shares will go from 20, 30, 40 - whatever they're truly worth. And two, because this is in an ETF format and because you can continually buy shares as in an open end, then you immediately reduce the amount of money that comes out of the Treasury, that comes out of the taxpayer's pocket.

DAVIDSON: Now, I'm pretty sure our listeners are going to send in a variety of comments, some positive. And some will find really smart issues with this. I'll tell you two things that jump out as...

CUBAN: Sure.

DAVIDSON: ...That are on your - actually positive for you. One is - a big problem with this complete lack of movement of these toxic assets right now is there's only so many institutions in the world that buy them - basically, really large banks or really large pension funds, that kind of thing.

CUBAN: Right.

DAVIDSON: And all of - pretty much anyone who might buy them already owns them. And that's - and so they don't want to buy any more of these toxic assets.

CUBAN: Right.

DAVIDSON: And so what you're talking about - you know, Mike and I can't go out and buy one of these assets because they're, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars to buy in. So you're talking about expanding it to the retail investor and just creating a much bigger pool of potential investors...

PESCA: And we could buy a tiny, tiny portion of it.

DAVIDSON: Right.

CUBAN: Right. You could buy $20 worth.

PESCA: And millions of us can buy, you know, one millionth of the assets.

CUBAN: Exactly.

DAVIDSON: And I guess...

PESCA: Right.

DAVIDSON: So - and then the other - or the other - I guess it's positive is, if it doesn't work and nobody's interested, the Treasury is sort of where they are now anyway.

CUBAN: Exactly. And - but it's transparent.

DAVIDSON: I'm a huge fan of something that you have helped launch just over the weekend, on Friday.

CUBAN: Sure.

DAVIDSON: When did BailoutSleuth start?

CUBAN: Last week.

DAVIDSON: Last week?

CUBAN: Yeah, we just started it last week.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And I was getting ready to email Chris and your - Chris Carey, your editor, and say, hey, what can we do together? Let's get you on our blog.

CUBAN: Yeah, absolutely.

DAVIDSON: So explain what BailoutSleuth is and what...

CUBAN: Obviously, you can tell that I'm a little cynical about the government being investors with our taxpayer money. And, you know, the government created an oversight committee of, I think, five people that, you know, I wouldn't trust to be regulators. They're the same regulators who got us into this mess. And so we created - Chris Carey and I created something called bailoutsleuth.com. And what it basically is, is on my own dime, I'm hiring several reporters to go out there and just keep an eye on what's going on with the bailout. And already, things are coming to light.

You know, they signed their first subcontractors to act in financial roles for the bailout. And already in the contracts, they're making them available publicly, but they're redacting specific information like the rates that they're paying or the actual people involved. And if this is all - you know, they've promised complete transparency. Why in the world would they redact the rates that they're paying? And, you know, by making this public and being somebody or having an organization that just monitors and babysits them continuously, I think, you know, we'll put pressure on them to increase the transparency of all these transactions.

DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mark Cuban, for - I really enjoyed that conversation. And we have a link to his blog at npr.org/money. That's our blog, by the way. His blog is bailoutsleuth.com. They looked into one of the very first contracts that Treasury set to associate with the $700 billion bailout and found that a lot - I mean, this is just a business contract...

CONAWAY: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: ...That is basically the taxpayers hiring the Bank of New York Mellon to take part in this $700 billion bailout, so sort of like we hired them. And it is redacted like a CIA secret prisons document.

CONAWAY: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: I mean, you see the contract on the Treasury website and it's just completely - half of it is just completely blacked out. For example, there's no sign of how much we're paying Bank of New York Mellon.

CONAWAY: It says so-and-so shall be paid. And then somebody just got the magic marker out.

DAVIDSON: And crossed it out. It's pretty amazing. I'm really excited about this new blog, the bailoutsleuth.com. I hope they keep digging up some great stuff like this. And we'll keep linking to them if they do. And I also like Mark's personal blog. It's kind of interesting. He has a very unique point of view. That's blogmaverick.com.

CONAWAY: And that's another day on PLANET MONEY. We're online at npr.org/money. Send pictures of the economy as you see it around you.

DAVIDSON: And go to npr.org/money. And look; I just put a shout out there. We're doing the first of what we hope will be a regular feature, the Economist House Call. Simon Johnson of baselinescenario.com and the former chief economist of the IMF, also of MIT and all sorts of distinguished things is going to help us assess your place in the global economy. And I don't mean you in a vague sense, I mean you specifically if you go to npr.org/money and tell us a little bit about you. We'll, maybe, pick you to call you Friday morning and assess your place in the global economy. I'm Adam Davidson.

CONAWAY: I'm Laura Conaway. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
We talk about greed, we talk about
lack of regulation or poor regulation, we talk about people over-borrowing
buying houses that had no reason buying houses
uh... but doesn't it offend your sensibility I guess that that all this
bailout has to come from the public sector at this moment in time
Hi and welcome to NPR's Planet Money
I'm Adam Davidson. Ignore the music we are
still in a financial crisis. Yeah, maybe even a recession
Hi Laura Conaway. Hi. Today's Tuesday October 21st
it's about 4.29 p.m. here in New York City and we've got a great show today
including what Adam calls the most embarrassing question he ever asked a
billionaire
and the billionaire's answer
Well now it's time Laura for the Planet Money indicators. The TED
spread has has really continued to fall. This is what we've been
hoping to see. This is our main indicator these days the
measure of
how money is moving through the
global economy from bank to bank how nervous the global economy is. It is
down well below three
two point seven four today that's a
more than eight percent fall uh... from
yesterday uh...
we always go every day now to tradition asial securities there are
friends on the front lines of the credit crisis we usually go to Will
Aston Rees or Tom Corona both of them are out right now but
John Chirico has very generously picked up their baton. Hey John. Hi, how are you guys?
Good good. So we check with you guys tradition asial every day you are where
you are this credit crisis I mean you are right on the front lines normally
in normal times banks will use you guys
to borrow and lend billions of dollars every day
for the last since September 15th basically it's been completely frozen
no lending at all
on friday we were hearing rumors of some other trading desks
beginning to see a thaw in this credit freeze
yesterday i think you guys moved a few hundred million not a huge
amount for you
certainly a huge amount for me but not for you
and so John how did today go is the ice continuing to thaw?
yeah well actually uh... we've seen uh... you know from what we look at it as
another step
hopefully
in the corrective phase and hopefully this will continue
the fed basically today
announced a plan where they're going to create a new facility to ease the
stress you know the continued stress in the short-term debt market
uh... you know they'll provide funds to be used in an effort
controlled by the private sector just to purchase you know all types of money
market instruments uh... you know to help relieve some of the stress
in the money market industry in general. The LIBOR opened up around uh...
three-month LIBOR opened up around three point eight three
uh... projected three-month LIBOR tomorrow as close to the three
you know fifty three fifty five range
uh... you know we've seen some money invested today uh... from you know one
month
in the one-month sector out to the six-month sector
and you know to me that's another
uh... positive step
uh... of getting this
market
you know to some sort of you know normal normal state uh... you know we
still have a long way to go uh...
we did see you know potentially upwards of you know a billion uh... or better
invested uh... predominantly three i'd say three months four months
so that's a big deal
six months so yeah it was a definite
a definite hope a definite
step in the right direction i think for all of us to see some interbank lending
and some natural
buyers come into the market as well with both cds
uh... yankee cd buying
both end deposit lenders
well that's
that's great news john uh... but but not back to where we were before
september fifteenth
now correct that's uh... still think it's a work in progress it's going to
take a little time uh... hopefully
you know the continued
measures by the fed
is going to help
he's is process uh... you know uh... they continue to
public really back into the system and do whatever it
you know takes so uh... we're all hoping here that that's going to be the
case going forward you know as we gradually get back to some sort of
normal
consistency in the market
great john treaco uh... a trader with tradition asial securities
talking to him he's in lower manhattan really on the front lines
of the credit crisis although these front lines happen to be like a nice
office with a comfortable chair in front of a bunch of computer screens
but still he is right where this crisis is happening
john thanks so much okay thank you
take care
and he was talking about that fed
uh... moved this morning i just want to talk about that real quick because i
think that's the biggest development of the day
this is something we've heard a lot about on planet money uh... our buddies will
and tom down there have been calling for this for a long time
you have these money market funds you and i talked about this yesterday on the
podcast yeah they were saying that
no one wants to buy this commercial paper the the short-term overnight
i use because they don't think they can turn around and sell them if they
need to right if you're a money market mutual fund which is basically like a
fancy high-earning savings account
you need to be ready to give people money if they ask for their money and
and the fear is that you'll lend a billion dollars to another bank
get this i a u in return
but tomorrow some your customers say hey i want my money
and you can't sell that i a u
because nobody else wants to lend money to banks because it's too risky
so now the federal reserve has said hey don't worry if you can't sell it
will take care of it will make sure that
will buy it for you basically it's more complicated than that but that's the
basic idea
it's what time and will have been calling for uh... on the blog i pointed
out that will is a little troubled with some of the details
but but it seems to be from what john has just been telling us that it
has had at least the beginning of the desired effect i think it's
interesting because the federal reserve earlier came in and said we will now
offer
commercial paper we will now make the loans if need be to businesses who
can't get them
now they're also saying will buy them back up
yes this today is yet another
massive expansion of the role of the federal reserve
uh... in the central bank of the u s and this
today's announcement
if it just plopped down in the middle of a normal time you know
three years ago or something
it would be like the biggest news of the century in at least in central
banking terms but it would be huge transformation of the role of the
central bank in the u s economy
of course every day for the last few weeks we've been having massive
transformations of the role of the central bank so this is just one more
step
it's a subtle one it's one that very few people will notice but this is
really important this means that
basically the u s
the federal reserve is absorbing the risk
of our financial system for everybody on all sides of these investments
exactly
you know i've actually started dreaming about the economy
that is disturbing yes i think it does kind of get to you
i got a listener question today about something that's
in the news
i'd just flat
couldn't answer it
the question comes from e-line adores weisman of washington d c
i've been hearing a lot about
these ideas of auctions
you being used to deal with the financial crisis uh...
uh... heard about the auction for the
credit default swap and i'm just wondering
what are these options how do they work uh...
how do you determine values from an auction
are we gonna be hearing a lot about this is this a good thing
just want to understand
you like i'm so with you i want to know
exactly what these options are
yeah yeah i feel like i've heard the word auction more in the last few
weeks then
at any point in my life so we called my friend hampton finer i want to
stuyvesant high school with them but he's now grown up and is the deputy
superintendent of the new york state department of insurance
hey hampton
how you doing adam all right how are you
great great well you've become a real expert in credit default swaps and
we actually have an extended conversation with you that we're
going to play
later this week but i wanted to
uh... sneak in under the gun because i thought he lies question was a
great one and wanted you to
help us understand so
so when we hear about
auction in the financial market setting
mission we'd be
picturing like a big hall and there's a guy with a gavel and there's a bunch
of people would like
things with numbers on them holding them up saying i'll take it at three
million i'll take it for me that there's a there's an electronic
version of that
uh... absolutely um... there are buyers and sellers and um...
they uh... did
uh... certain amounts of the willing to pay and uh... ask certain amounts
that they're willing to accept
and there's a electronic uh... system and a computer program that matches up
those bids
and works out uh... what we call in in economics uh... market clearing price
and uh... real bonds are being sold
uh... at these options
so it's it's not everyone's not in one place they're in their office
title world it
the auction itself actually takes place in london
i'm not sure exactly why but it takes place in london
could anyone take part or do you have to have a special license
no i mean you have to be part of uh...
you could take part through your dealer certainly but only uh... dealers
are allowed to participate but there may be lots of hedge funds
and other investors that are participating through their dealers
and there's one going on today for lehman brothers no the lehman one
took place last week the next one will be for wamu
for washington mutual but the auction itself took place last week today
uh... the trade settle
for lehman cds
last week they set the prices
today the money changes hands
okay so last week the
the buyers bid for whatever they wanted to pay
the people who had them agreed to accept that price it came in at
something like on average something like eight
eight cents on the dollar or something really low about eight and a half
cents on the dollar that's correct right so today they're actually
trading hands
now today they actually pay so people who sold protection
we'll have to uh... give about ninety one
a little more than ninety one cents on the dollar
ninety one half cents on the dollar to people who
who bought protection and in exchange uh... well that will be the terms of
the exchange
uh... for cash settled
uh... cds
if i happen to buy a bond from lehman brothers and i own it and it's
like a hundred dollar bond
and i got a little nervous maybe a year ago that lehman brothers might go
out of business i might have called you hampton and said hey i want to
buy protection which is basically almost like a form of insurance
and i would say to you i'm gonna give you a couple bucks a year
and then you get to keep that couple bucks but if lehman
defaults if they go bankrupt or
uh... and my bond is suddenly worth a lot less or nothing
you have promised to make me whole to give me
promise to give you that a hundred dollars and you've been returned promise
to give me the bond
of course when lehman defaults the bond is going to be worth a lot less
than a hundred dollars i'm going to give you
right so so and that's basically where we are now
that the only question is we knew
we knew the bonds were worth less than a hundred dollars but we didn't know
how much less exactly i mean you needed to have a reliable mechanism
for price discovery and to determine
what the true value of those bonds were
interestingly going into the auction
there were people that thought those bonds might be worth a little bit more
like twelve cents instead of eight
and can i just ask a dumb question
i mean if a company goes bankrupt
why would their bonds have any value well they have assets and there's going
to be some degree of recovery i mean they weren't utterly
uh... without assets it was just
you know a bankruptcy means you don't have enough resources
to pay your current debts
but there certainly are assets in the company they have a building in
midtown they have a lot of big portfolio of other assets they have
companies that they're able to sell
so there's going to be some recovery value to the enterprise
and the bondholders the senior bondholders are the first people to get
that money i see and and we don't know what that recovery is yet we don't know
what they're gonna sell the building for whatever
and so basically the auction
allows you know you hear this phrase the wisdom of the crowd it
basically allows the global investor class
to place bets on how much value they think these things are going to be
worth
absolutely i mean there's a very liquid market in lehman's debt even
though they are
no longer in a position to pay principal and interest because once the
enterprise is liquidated
they'll presumably be some recovery so whoever this auction simulated that
marketplace
got you so whoever paid eight and a half cents or nine cents presumably
they believe that
these bonds one day will be worth more than that and whoever sold it
believes they won't be and but that's the price where those two sides kind
of met exactly and there is a very explicit market clearing mechanism that
makes sure
that all the people that want the bonds can buy them and all the people that
want to sell them
can tell them that whatever the the auction prices so he lies final question
was we're hearing all about about all these options are they a good thing
i'm getting the strong sense from you
yes these are good i think that there's a best way or at least a very
effective way
uh... of discovering what the actual price ought to be
uh... without a lot of the uh... imperfections that might exist
in uh... the larger bond market it's this very it's kind of a laboratory
for price discovery that's been very effective there's been fourteen uh... i
believe of these options so far
in in in to settle cds
since this crisis began no no forever ever
very few there are there are very few default events in the auction
process is relatively new
thanks elaine adores weisman for asking that impossible question and
hampton finer for answering i'm starting to get it
adam could you just
lighten this thing up a little bit
yeah let's lighten things up and by the way i think planet money
we try and make everything clear in one step but some of these things like the
cds it's a it's so complicated
stick with it you're gonna get it if this stuff is seeping into your you
know and into your brain yes you know it
this is complicated stuff we have a crisis that is complicated and we're
doing our best to make it clear sometimes it's easier than other
times
mike pesca you know sits right next he actually sits between us yes poor
guys we're yelling at each other all day friendly way we're just calling out
to each other all day there's mike pesca in the middle he's npr sports
reporter and are good friend and he has been
trying to get me on the phone with this guy
for
for weeks he's he's obsessed with this guy because he really straddles the
world of sports and fine yeah who
i'm embarrassed to say it i hadn't heard of him okay is that horrible
mark cuban you've heard of him for the name i didn't really know who he was
he's the owner of the dallas mavericks he also owns hd net the cable network
he made
billions of dollars literally i think makes a two point eight billion at
last count
from broadcast dot com
and he also has this pretty awesome blog blog maverick dot com and and
some other blogs that he's associated with so pescan i call them to see
what he has to say about the financial crisis
mark i wanted to before we get into the various topics
this might be like
the most embarrassing question i've ever asked but i've
uh... you are the third billionaire i've talked to and here's what i want
to ask me for me when i look at my stock portfolio
i mean that's going to determine
how i
what kind of life i have you know
and i'm young enough that it's okay but my parents you know it means it
changes their retirement picture
when you're sort of in the world where
you're gonna have a good life no matter what happens
and you're you know you sound happy that you which is too i totally get
it i'm
big believer in in market incentives and all of that you know you're
glad that you'd
you made smart choices that got you more money i bet you'd be upset if
you lost money
but is it
what is it at that point when it doesn't actually affect you anymore is
it just keeping score is it an intellectual you know i'm a very very
competitive person so money is a
a unique way to keep score but i i gotta tell you
i think a lot of people
they get financially to my level try to define themselves by their bank
accounts and
you know don't you know who i am because of how much money i have been
you know i'm the exact opposite
you know i i look at myself as the luckiest guy in the world and i just
try to have fun and
and the other money for definitely facilitates that
uh... info you know
uh... i had fun before i have a more fun now but i guess the question
is there's not if you lost half a billion dollars
there's still nothing that you couldn't do because of that i assume i mean you
could do whatever you want at your current level and i mean look i i'm
not going to be limited by by my finances and the choices i make
you know i'm i mean i'm not going to buy a uh... a fleet of fifty seven
sixty sevens
you know there are limits i guess
you know and and within a normal
day-to-day life there's there's nothing that i'm gonna be limited by
and and you know look there's other people just all you have to do is look
at the financial markets these days you know aubrey mcclendon
who had to sell all the shares in in chesapeake there are people who have
been wiped out
and so you know
the the flip side of all this is that
you can't get greedy you can't you know want more more more because
you know if you're just squeezing for for the next basis point or
squeezing for the next dollars and
and you take on leverage in those types of things you put yourself at
risk and
you know there's just no reason to risk
to risk everything to get anything more
i want to get to blog maverick which is your blog and normally it's
just about whatever's going on in the world are occurring to you lately it's
been all about economics which is a reflection of the national mood
uh... you have a lot of interesting proposals on blog maverick let's go
over a couple of her one was
there's this issue of mark to market accounting which you i mean maybe adam
could uh... define it a little bit easier as i understand it is
these banks have these assets and no one really knows what they're
worth so the government says hey put a price tag on it and they do
but no one really knows if that price tag is accurate they're kind
of guessing so you had a solution for this which was what
well i mean the market is all about transparency
and you know we should
if you don't have enough information
as a cfo of a bank or or controller of a bank
well just publish the data because the market
you know the people are in the around the market will give you data
enough data to make a decision
and so you know my my suggestion was
based off of the fact that
banks are going to need bailed out and and need capital infusions rather than
just leaving it to business as usual if you're taking taxpayer money
you should be publishing all the data about all the assets you have
and you know
by making that data transparent you'll you'll be in a better position to
determine the the market valuations
of of what you own and not only that you'll be in better position to
possibly sell it
at a better price than you might otherwise be able to get
and i guess the banks would say well wait a second mark that that's
our proprietary information we don't want to reveal all the secrets we have
on our you know the investments we have what exposure we have
some of them if we have brew bradley chained up in our financial dungeon
right right and i would say that's fine but don't take taxpayer money and
you're on your own
right and then you're gonna call another another interesting idea is
something called ETFs which are
they're sort of like stocks they trade on the market but they're a
collection of uh...
like a closed end fund which is actually they're not they're not closed
in but right that that's the key differential
you know what i suggested was
if the government is going to be buying these assets any assets
they're obviously having to take money from the treasury and
either printed or borrow it
through treasury bills etcetera
and then give that money to to banks and and others who own these
non-performing assets
well once they've purchased whatever it is they're going to buy it whatever
price they're going to buy it at
then it goes into that government of this that we never know anything more
about
and i think that's going to create big problems
and even if it makes money for them like everybody suggesting
will never really know because it goes into the general treasury
and you know who keeps track of anything once it gets to that point
and what i suggested was to say
look you can identify the assets that you're going to buy whether they're
homes
condos
mortgages mortgage mortgage-backed securities collateralized that whatever
it is
identify it
and package them together
into an electronically traded fun and what happens then is
everybody on wall street or any individual uh... institution fund
whatever
will have the opportunity to buy shares in that fund
so if the treasury as an example
uh... spent two hundred fifty billion dollars for assets
and they post all those assets in
an asset listing for the fun
then all three of us can go in there and by
you know that you know let's end up a kid just uh... whatever share price will
pay it's two hundred billion dollars
there there ten billion shares and the twenty dollars a piece
and then you were any of us can go in there
and actually purchased the shares
and the shares that are purchased that that twenty dollars per share
goes right into the treasury to offset what was spent
by uh...
through the taxpayers
and so then all of a sudden
if there really is a good market for these
wall street is going to recognize that a piece the shares are either undervalued
over value
and the price will fluctuate through the real value of the assets
the important element there is twofold
one
each of us as individuals can participate
so that if we recognize that this really is a good deal
will want will want part of it will buy your shares no shares ago from
twenty thirty forty whatever
with a they're truly worth
and to
because this is in an e t a format
and because you continually
buy shares as in an open end
then
you immediately reduce the amount of money
that comes out of the treasury that comes out of the taxpayers pocket
now i'm pretty sure our listeners are going to send in a variety of comments some positive
and some will find really smart
issues with this
i'll tell you two things that jump out as as a that that are on your
on actually positive for you
one is a a big problem with this complete
lack of movement of these toxic assets right now is there's only
so many institutions in the world that by them basically really large banks are
really large pension funds that kind of thing right and all of
pretty much anyone who might buy them
already owns them and that's and so they don't want to buy any more of
these toxic assets right
and so what you're talking about it
mike and i can't go out and buy one of these assets cuz they're
you know hundreds of millions of dollars to buy in
so you're talking about
bringing it to the retail investor and just creating a much bigger pool of
potential investors and we can buy a tiny tiny portion of it
millions of us can buy you know one millionth of the assets and i guess
and then the other benefit or the other i guess it's positive is
if it doesn't work and nobody's interested
the treasury is sort of where they are now anyway exactly but it's transparent
i'm a huge fan of something that you have helped launch just
the weekend on friday
uh... when when did bailout sleuths last week started last week yeah and and
uh... i was getting ready to email chris and your chris carrey your editor
and say hey what can we do together let's get you on our blog
yeah absolutely
so explain what bailouts sleuth is and what
obviously you can tell them a little cynical about the government
being investors with our our taxpayer money and
you know they
the government created an oversight committee
of i think five people that
you know i wouldn't trust
to be out regulators either the same regulators who got us into this mess
and so we created chris carrey and i created something called bailouts sleuth
dot com
and what it basically is is on my own dime i'm hiring several
reporters to go out there
and just
keep an eye
on what's going on with the bailout
and already things are coming to light
you know they find their first contract
subcontractors to to act in financial roles
for the bailout
and already in the contracts they're they're making available publicly
but they're redacting specific information like the rates they're
paying
where the actual people involved
and if this is all you know if they've promised complete transparency
why in the world would they redact
the the rates that they're paying
and you know by making this public and
and being somebody or having an organization that just
monitors and babysits them continuously
you know we'll put pressure on them to
increase the transparency of of all these transactions
thank you mark cuban for i really enjoyed that conversation uh... and we
have linked to his blog at npr dot
org slash money
that's our blog by the way
his blog is bailout sleuth dot com
uh... they
looked into one of the very first contracts that treasury uh... set to
to uh... associate with the seven hundred billion dollar bailout
and found that allot i mean this is just a a a business contract that is
basically the taxpayers hiring uh... the bank of new york melon
to to take part in this seven hundred billion dollar bailout so
so like we hired them
and it is redacted like a c i a
secret prisons document yet you you see the contract on the treasury
website and it's just completely
half of it is just completely blacked out
for example there's no sign uh... of how much we're paying
bank of new york melon says so and so shall be paid and then somebody just got
the magic marker out and and cross it out it's pretty amazing i'm really
excited about this new blog uh... the bailout sleuth dot com i i hope they
keep digging up some
great stuff like this and we'll keep linking to them if they do
and uh... i also like marks personal blog it's kind of interesting he has
a very unique point of view
that's blog maverick dot com
and that's another day on planet money we're online at npr dot org slash
money send pictures of the economy as you see it around you
and go to npr dot org slash money and look i just put a shout out there we're
doing the first of what we hope will be a regular feature the economist
house call
simon johnson of baseline scenario dot com and the former chief economist of
the i m f also of m i t and all sorts of distinguished things
is going to help us
assess your place
in the global economy and i don't mean you
in a big sense i mean you specifically if you go to npr dot org slash money
and tell us a little bit
about you will
maybe pick you to call you friday morning and assess your place in the
global economy
i'm adam davidson
i'm laura conaway thanks for listening
