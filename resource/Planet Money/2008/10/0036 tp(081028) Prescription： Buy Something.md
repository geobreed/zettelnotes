**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**
Let's give everybody out there a refresher course, a little layaway 101.
How does it work?
You find something you like, you set it aside, you do have to set aside a small deposit with
that as well.
Usually it's a percentage of the total purchase price of that item.
So you do that, then you make your payments whether monthly, bimonthly, however it's
set up.
So you put it on hold, the store keeps it.
The store keeps it for you and that's why you're paying that little service fee there.
This is NPR's Planet Money.
Today is Tuesday, October 28th.
It's about 4.26 p.m. here in New York City.
Adam Davidson is out reporting.
He just black buried in that he has a big get somewhere out there in the field.
Can't wait to hear what this get is.
I'm Laura Conaway and unlike the TV types you just heard, I am not putting anything
on layaway and that would be fine, except that like so many of you out there, I've
stopped buying things by whatever means really almost completely.
The Planet Money indicator for today has to do with shopping.
We're going to hear from a listener on this in just a minute in our second Economist
House call.
Meanwhile, a group called the Conference Board released a survey today that I find just
shocking.
They say consumer confidence is the lowest it has been since they started asking people
about it 35 years ago.
Now look, a lot of people don't care for this kind of survey all about how people
feel.
We're going to try to talk tomorrow to economist Amir Sufi.
He's the guy who's been warning us about the steep drop off and spending by people
like you and me.
Sufi told me today that he wants to wait for another set of numbers.
He doesn't even want to talk about this one.
So we asked the people who did the consumer confidence survey.
I spoke to Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board.
Well look, every month for the last three decades, actually now three and a half decades,
We've been asking folks where they think the economy and the labor market are now and
where they could be headed over the next six months.
And again, I mean, you know, there are lots of times when we just see just a
little noise in the system, not much change month to month.
That is not a description about where we've been over the last 12 months.
You've got consumers who began to be worried even two years ago about the value of
their homes and about how much it was going to cost to fill up that gas tank.
None of those concerns have really gone away.
Starting about last, almost about this time a year ago, consumers began to worry
that the problems in terms of the overall economy were beginning, were going to begin
to weaken the labor market.
And of course, you know, consumers pay attention to what happens in terms of the stock
market.
They pay far more attention to what happens in terms of the housing market.
But what really gets their attention, and certainly we see this just for the last
month, is any big change in the labor market, so much so that right now there's
only three things that worry the average consumer.
It's not what happens to the stock market or even to their 401k, let alone the value
of their home.
What most affects people are my job, my job, and my job, and what's the worry
here?
We've lost jobs every month from January right through September.
Nine straight months.
Nine straight months.
And the consumer not only is expecting that to continue, but not only expecting
that to continue, not only expecting the number of jobs lost to increase, but
more and more folks are worrying about, you know, is it going to be me next month?
And therefore, what we get here is not only a huge drop in confidence, but a
drop down to a level lower than anything we've ever seen, lower than at the
bottom of some very severe recessions in the mid-1970s and again in the
early 1980s, much lower, in fact, than anything we've seen back then.
But in the great disco recession of the 1970s, you're saying that people
even then felt more confident than they feel now.
They were down in the dumps then.
They were tightening their bolts, their household budgets then.
They were worried about where the labor market was going then.
The level of concern now exceeds, and not by a little bit, even the worry
back then.
These are folks out there who have been worried for the last 12 months and
who are close to panicking now.
Is it the length of time people have been worried that makes the
difference between now and the 1970s?
Well certainly that's one factor, but that's not the only factor.
It's also the fact that this is cutting across all fields, all regions, and one
of the other big changes between now and let's say the early 1970s.
It used to be the case that if you got laid off, there was at least a
chance you might be called back.
These folks who are losing their jobs now, those jobs are lost permanently.
So in other words, if you used to work at a manufacturing plant, they
might lay you off for a little bit while orders dropped and then bring
you back.
And most of the folks today who are being told we're going to have to let
you go because the economy is so bad, they're not going to be coming back
to that job.
There are some people who are coming back.
I have a friend who works in Detroit who has been laid off five or six
times and he's back in the plant right now, although I'm sure he's on
the bubble again.
Well he's on the bubble again, and also you're talking about those
16, 17 million people in the United States who still work in
manufacturing.
We have about 146 million people who are working at some job or other
today.
And so for the other 120 million, when they get told no more job, it's
no more job.
And while most of those will eventually go back to work, most of
them will go back to work at a job that doesn't pay as well as the
one that they just lost.
When you say consumer confidence, what is the emphasis there on the
consumer?
You're not just saying sort of national confidence or people confidence.
You're saying something that I equate with buying, the buyer's
confidence, the shopper's confidence.
Well the way that I would say this is that small changes in
confidence usually are associated with small changes in spending
patterns.
But when you get a big change, and clearly that's exactly what
we're looking at right now, a big decline, when you get a big
change in sentiment level that's almost always associated with a
big and perhaps even permanent change in terms of spending
pattern.
And so what we're looking at right now is a level of confidence
we've never seen before, almost certain to be associated with
consumers taking yet another look at what they can do without in
terms of their household budget and probably not changing that,
certainly not easing that belt tightening in the household
budget, perhaps for another full year or more.
So when you talk about a permanent change, I mean, again, the
first place I go to think is well the depression generation and
how my grandparents and great grandparents think about money
and how reluctantly they part with it.
And are you saying that today that my spending patterns are
being affected by this forever?
Well I don't know about forever.
Forever is a long time.
But look, to have gone through, think of yourself.
Where you've been for the last 12 months and imagine you have
to do even more over the next 12 months, it's going to take a
long time, maybe not forever, but it's going to take a long
time before you forget about 2008 and 2009.
I mean, I was laid off twice in one 12 month calendar period
between 2007 and 2008.
And I guess I'm trying to say that I relate very
personally to what you say when you say that we're
looking at perhaps a long term shift in the way people spend.
I have, even though my income is fine, I am spending less money.
There's no question.
You know, you take a kid, let's say, who's still in
school or maybe just got out of school and starting out.
And so if you have to change jobs a few times either
because you want to or because, you know, the work
environment wasn't enough to hold on to your job, that's
one thing and you can bounce back from that.
And most people do.
When you're in your 30s and 40s and 50s and you thought this
career was secure and those folks losing their job and
knowing when they do go back to work, it's not going to be
for as much money as what they used to make, as well as
what just happened to their pension, what just happened to
their medical coverage, and all the while watching the
prices that we pay for, not just for food, for cable TV,
for telephone, and on and on continue to rise.
I mean, people really get concerned about, you know,
what are we going to do?
Not only what are we going to do this month, but what
are we going to do going forward?
And I'm suggesting to you, this will end.
It's not going to stay like, it's not going to be
like this forever, but this is going to take a long time
to put into memory.
So that the lingering impact of all of this in terms of
what's going on in prices, in wage increases, in medical
cost, in terms of job availability, this is going to
take a long time to put in past memory.
That was Ken Goldstein doing a fine job of depressing
everyone in a novel way.
Ken, Adam Davidson, we'll be very glad you did that.
People, we've got to get out there and spend money, at
least some money.
My family, we marched across the street just this
Saturday, and we bought treats from a bakery so we
could spend money.
And I am serious.
We did.
We really did it, and for that reason.
Our next guest sounds like he knows where
I'm coming from.
Jesse Kachapas is 34.
He lives in Rhode Island, and he works for a
software company.
Jesse dialed in for an economist house call with
Simon Johnson of Baseline Scenario.
In the last two months, especially in the last 30
days, 45 days, I have cut my spending.
I don't buy things anymore.
I was a real, what you call, an early adopter.
I spent a lot of money.
My wife just had fun with it.
You mean buying iPods when they first came out, and
then iPhones, and then Play Stations?
Yeah, I've owned every version of the iPod and all
that stuff.
My gadget spending alone, I think I put, would send us
into a recession.
My whole thing is, this whole downturn, it's so
advertised.
Housing hits home, especially with people in my age
group, and 401Ks, and being able to see it day to
day, either online, being able to manage your
account, your company 401K accounts, and seeing
them plummet.
What effect is that going to have?
And has it occurred that way in the past?
Whereas a recession would come on, and people
would know about it once we were in it.
Most people weren't directly affected by your
housing price going down 20%, and seeing your
retirement fund going down 30%, 40%.
Is that going to have a different effect this time
than it had last time?
Are there other people like me in my age group
that are just not spending money?
For example, my wife walked in Boston, she was in
Copley Place, and she walked by Banana Republic,
and they were handing out flyers for 30% off, and
she was like, it was just completely empty.
She didn't buy anything, but she was like, it was
amazing.
She'd never seen it like that.
So it's scary.
Simon, is the advertising of the recession
having an effect here?
Yes, it is, and I'm afraid a lot of retail
consumers are feeling the same way Jesse and
his wife are feeling.
There's a little bit of shock with regard to
what's happened, and we have seen some things
like this in the past.
We saw the dot com bubble burst, but that
didn't go along with a big bursting of a housing
bubble or other falls in asset prices.
And I'd like to try and gently encourage Jesse
to go back into the stores and buy a few things,
maybe a large coffee or something.
We really do need the consumer to keep at it, Jesse.
Interestingly enough, Apple said this week that
iPhone sales still look pretty good.
And that is, I think, as Jesse was mentioning,
the Apple line of products are sort of
classic early adopter kinds of things.
So as long as people do want to buy those
technology products and drive, that of course
helps drive the overall innovation process in
this country, we'll be okay.
If all the retail buyers, consumers, want to sit
out until January and not buy anything,
then we have more of a problem.
Now I see that, Jesse, you're 34 and your
wife is 29.
Yep.
Simon, he was asking how this compares to
past recessions.
Is he just too young?
Is this pretty standard for what has existed
in the past, or is this different with the
impact on house prices and other things that
people feel in their gut?
It's certainly different.
It's certainly, we haven't seen anything like
it in this country since the late 70s, early 80s.
And you can argue that even what we saw then
was not as bad.
I mean, we have all these problems or issues,
let's call them issues, around the banking
system, which hopefully are on their way to
being resolved.
But I don't think we ever saw anything like
that in the U.S., at least since the 1930s.
I don't think we're in for a reprise of
the 1930s.
And Ben Bernanke is stressing that we've
learned the lessons.
And the key lesson is, don't let prices fall.
Right?
So don't let debt burdens get worse.
Now, that's good.
That's very important.
But how much better can we make it?
What are the policies we're going to see
over the next few months that are really
going to pull us out of this?
And to what extent is the government going
to step in and take responsibility for buying?
Just like Jesse and his wife don't want to
buy, the government can do some buying.
That's the whole point of the fiscal stimulus.
But how much can the government do and how
quickly?
That we don't yet know.
So Jesse actually is making as much money.
He's not directly.
You're not directly losing money because
of this recession, but you're cutting back
on spending because of a feeling of
anxiety.
Is that right?
Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, I'm looking 12 months ahead and
saying, OK, I got to make sure that if
anything terrible happens to me or my wife
loses her job or I lose mine, that we
have enough money to be able to get through
it alive.
So you're feeling anxiety.
You're cutting down on spending, which is
actually it's sort of you're creating the
condition you're afraid of.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Self-fulfilling prophecy.
Self-fulfilling prophecy is to Simon, to
what extent is, you know, if we could give
everybody a pill and make them feel
confident all of a sudden, would that solve
the problem?
Well, it would certainly help at least
at least for a while.
Obviously, the thing people are worried
about, Jesse just expressed it very
clearly, is job, your job.
What's going to happen to your job?
What's going to happen to your spouse's
job? And we just don't know.
There's an enormous amount of uncertainty
that's been generated really just in the
last six weeks.
All the kinds of things that we thought we
could take for granted in terms of the
nature of the economy and where the good
jobs would be and how much you could get
paid for doing this or that.
It's all been sort of thrown into question.
We desperately need to get some stability
back.
Anti-anxiety pills would be good.
I think some positive, more assertive
measures by the government would also be
pretty helpful at this point.
I do think we'll regain the sort of
psychological equilibrium in January,
February, but we still have to get
through a couple of months.
But to what extent is a recession at
any point or this particular one some
real thing that's actually happening?
And to what extent is it just
psychological, just anxiety?
Well, there's always a real thing going
on and then the issues are exacerbated
by various kinds of anxiety.
So the real thing here is obviously that
housing got a little bit overheated
and the house prices need to come down.
And those problems got multiplied
several times by the fact that key
parts of the financial system had taken
on far too much risk.
So that was already the problem in the
summer.
And then we had the particular handling
of Lehman and AIG in mid-September,
the way in which creditors in
particular took big losses on what
they thought were pretty safe
investments.
That created a big crisis of
confidence around the world.
And that's what we're still trying
to deal with.
So these are real things that become
psychological things that become
self-fulfilling.
You can stop it to some degree by
restoring confidence.
And that is what governments in the G7
countries, the big industrialized
countries, are now trying to do.
Unfortunately, it's the metaphor of
letting the genie out of the bottle
is a good one.
It's hard to persuade the genie to
go back in the bottle.
Genie is out and having fun.
And that same thing is true with
anxiety.
It's running around and it takes a
while to round it up and get it
back in the bottle.
All right, Jesse Katsapis in
Rhode Island.
Thank you so much.
I guess the only thing we have to
fear is fear itself and also the
underlying things that are causing
the fear.
Yeah, that's easy.
Yeah.
All right.
Take care, Jesse.
So that's the word from Simon
Johnson to Jesse Katsapis.
We'll be doing another round of
Economist House Calls soon.
So send us your story at
planetmoney at NPR.org.
And keep in touch with us
online.
Keep in touch all the time.
Send us links to what you're
reading.
I really like including those on
the blog.
We're at NPR.org slash money.
And I want to say I'm starting to
see you all out there helping
each other.
This economy can be tough to
understand.
And I'm right there with you.
I really am.
It helps to know that we're all
in it together and it helps if
we help each other like you're
doing.
And I really appreciate it.
That's planet money for today.
I'm off to interview Suchajit Das
for a podcast later this week, I
hope.
I'm Laura Conaway.
You go spend some money.
OK.
