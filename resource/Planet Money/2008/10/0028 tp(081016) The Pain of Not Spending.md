Inflation went down last month, which turns out to be unnerving instead of good news. That's partly because consumers are keeping their money in their pockets, even with cheaper prices on the shelves. Plus: An expert gives us a tour of one bank's balance sheet.

**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**
What's your name?
My name is Joe Wurzenbacher.
Good to see you, Joe.
I'm getting ready to buy a company that makes $250, $270, $80,000 a year.
Your new tax plan is going to tax me more, isn't it?
Well, here's what's going to happen.
Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
That was Joe, the very famous plumber you just heard.
We're joined today by our buddy Alex Bloomberg.
Hey, how's it going?
Good to see you, Alex.
Good to see you.
Alex, today is Thursday, October 16th.
It's about, what is it, 10 to 4 in the PM here in New York.
Adam, go ahead and give us the Planet Money indicators.
Well, actually, I want to bring in our buddy Tom Corona from Tradition Asia Securities.
He is on the front lines of the credit crisis.
Tom, are banks lending to each other yet?
The bank market is still frozen.
There's been sporadic lending in the very short area of one month.
We haven't seen really any significant lending yet in the longer dates,
three months through six months.
People don't quite understand exactly what the guarantees on these banks are yet,
and I guess they're just trying to get a grasp on exactly what the plan is
on guaranteeing the interbank senior debt market.
But most of the money funds that we speak to are still refraining from buying any type of bank debt,
and the banks are not lending to each other.
On a positive note, the commercial paper market seems to have started to trade
with a little bit more liquidity with the CP facility coming in.
The corporate names, the top corporate names are trading again.
Money funds are buying limited amounts out to three months.
So there is some light at the end of the tunnel.
Do you think it's that the money markets and the other investors,
I mean, has the problem been solved but people haven't figured it out yet,
or maybe the problem hasn't been solved?
I think it's a combination of both, but I really think that the funds themselves
don't really understand exactly where the guarantees are,
and they still are wary and are not trusting the balance sheet of the banks yet.
I mean, you saw again today UBS getting a $60 billion capital injection,
and until these headlines just stop hitting the tape on the banks,
I guess the funds, the investors, they're comfortable sitting on the sidelines
and accepting lower yields.
And a perfect example of this is the Treasury bill market.
The short bills, the two-week, the three-week bills, are trading with negative yields.
It happened one last week, and about two weeks ago
when we had the first big down trade in the stock market.
This hasn't happened since the Great Depression,
and it's basically people willing to buy an asset such as the Treasury bill
because they know they'll get their money back in two weeks, three weeks,
and they'll accept a small negative return for the safety of the Treasury bill.
Well, Tom Corona, thank you so much.
You depress us in a different way every time we talk,
so thank you very much.
Sorry to do that.
I can't wait for the phone call to tell you that everything's fixed
and it's time to get back in.
Let's hope that's next week.
All right, thanks, Tom Corona of Tradition Asia Securities.
Thank you.
So Tom Corona is a middleman between banks.
When a bank needs to borrow some money,
Tom Corona will get money through bonds basically,
short-term bonds from either another bank or one of these money market funds,
and he's just sitting there not doing anything.
And Alex, you know, because you've seen his office in the old days,
he would easily trade billions of dollars a day.
Right. It's a huge, huge office with tons of traders who are doing this.
And basically what they do is there's organizations and institutions
with lots and lots of money, and they lend it to people,
and they're just not lending it.
They're just giving it to the U.S. government.
So when he was saying that Treasury bonds were trading negative,
what that means is normally even if you're going to lend to the U.S. government,
you want some return, maybe a 1%, 3%, something small.
People are willing to lend to the U.S. government and lose money.
That's astounding to me.
Because they feel confident that at least they will get some of the money back.
That is what they call flight to quality.
We've been joking that the U.S. government has become the world's biggest mattress
when you just shove your money.
Right. And a lot of people say, well, why don't you just keep it in cash?
If you're just going to get a negative return, why don't you just keep it in cash?
And that runs into a problem.
If you have multiple millions or billions or trillions of dollars,
you can't just keep it in cash because your deposits aren't guaranteed that high.
They're only guaranteed up to a certain amount.
So you have to put it somewhere that's not cash,
and Treasurer is the best thing to put it in.
And our other planet money indicator, the TED spread that we talk a lot about,
which measures how banks are or are not lending to each other,
it actually got a little better yesterday and then got worse.
And today it's better.
So it's still above four, which is a troubling number.
Very troubling.
We want that way below one.
Historically high.
But it did fall 6 percent.
And with the TED spread, the lower it is, the better.
So at least it fell 6 percent. That's good.
Frankly, we want it to fall 80 percent, 75 percent.
Right.
Or more.
Six percent's not going to do it.
Six percent's not going to do it.
But at least it's moving in the right direction.
There was another indicator that came out today,
which is the consumer price index.
And that is also sort of a mixed bag.
It came out and it basically said the consumer price index measures inflation.
It measures how much more things cost today than they did last week or last month.
And everybody thinks that if inflation is low, that's good.
And the consumer price index came out today and inflation is basically flat.
Which is fabulous.
I don't have to pay anything more for sandwiches and computers and cars.
It's wonderful news.
You would think.
I set you up there.
Yeah, thank you very much.
You're a professional.
The problem is that on the other side of inflation is deflation.
And deflation, almost every economist will tell you, is worse.
And deflation hasn't really happened in this country since, again, the Great Depression.
So deflation is when it just keeps going down?
When prices go down day after day.
Yeah, deflation is the opposite of inflation when prices go down.
Which seems like a good thing, maybe.
Well, it is a good thing in a very, very limited context,
but it's not actually a good thing.
If you're talking about actual, what economists talk about when they're talking about deflation,
that is not simply prices, things becoming more affordable.
That is an actual monetary problem.
And what it means is basically everything's price is going down.
And when everything's price goes down, the thing that you could, as a company,
the thing that you could sell for $5 today, you can only sell for $4 tomorrow.
So you're making less money.
And then if you're making less money, you can only pay your workers less money.
And if your workers are making less money, then they can't buy as much stuff.
So demand goes down, and then the prices of goods and services go down even more.
And you also have an incentive, I would think, not to invest,
because why build a factory for $100 million to make goods that are going to cost less,
and the factory will be worth less than $100 million.
And then if there's less investment, then that also feeds into this vicious cycle.
So there is, so deflation is really, it just turns into a downward spiral very, very quickly.
So that is why, and this is what Ben Bernanke is worried about.
That's why everybody who is sort of worried about inflation in the beginning,
their words have proven to be tragically not on target.
Worrying about the wrong thing.
I don't want to waste money worrying about the wrong thing.
Now I'm going to worry about deflation, and I'm going to worry about a recession.
I think a theme for the last couple of weeks has been every day we want to scare
and depress our listeners in a slightly different way.
Now, it should be pointed out that during the Great Depression,
the Fed didn't do all the things that the Fed is now doing today.
So they are on this case.
This is the thing that Ben Bernanke is very worried about,
and he's fighting as much as he can.
Okay, look, since we're not going to worry about the Great Depression right this second,
I'm going to worry about the recession, because I'm getting a lot of this on the blog.
We have a listener question from Leah Hyman of Portland, Oregon.
Leah is in her late 20s, poor thing.
I'm too young to have experienced a recession.
I know that there have been recessions during my lifetime,
but I've never been old enough to be affected by them,
and now I am old enough to be affected by them.
And I have no idea what a recession really means to my everyday life.
Does it mean that bread is going to be really expensive?
Does it mean that inflation is going to be totally insane?
Does it mean that all the restaurants and bars in my town are going to go under?
Well, some of them are going to go under, yes.
I mean, I think it does mean, you know, I think we were all alive in the late 70s.
We were all alive in 1991 during that recession.
That's right when I graduated from college.
Yeah, that's when I graduated from college.
And that's my basic adult memory of a recession,
is graduating from college and not being able to find a job.
No jobs. They just told us there would be no jobs.
That was it. Forget it. You can get a job.
And there was a feeling.
I mean, I think of that feeling you have when you have a really bad flu
and you just think I always have been sick and I always will be sick
and you can't imagine feeling well.
And that's what I remember in 1991 is just this depressing feeling
that whatever happened in America when young people had a dream
and a vision and could imagine success, that phase of America is over.
And it's just a miserable slog with a dark future.
You had a much more macro view of it.
I remember just thinking like, oh, I just thought that was the way it was
when you graduated from college,
because I didn't fully realize that we were even really in a recession.
I knew we were in a recession,
but I didn't actually understand what that meant as an adult.
But I remember later in the 90s when we were out of a recession
and I would start meeting kids and they're like 20, you know, 22, 23,
and they were graduating from college and just like jumping into the job market
and getting paid lots and lots of money.
And that's when I realized, oh, I graduated during a recession.
That's what that was.
But, you know, I didn't really notice the recession,
the recessions that I've lived through in terms of prices so much.
I actually felt like I had plenty of money.
I worked very little,
and I lived in a really cheap little $200 room in an apartment in San Francisco,
and then I lived in another cheap little place in Maine.
You just didn't have a ton of money, but you had a lot of time.
And I notice now in my neighborhood,
more families out doing things like playing kickball.
There are more pickup games going on in the parks.
I'm not saying we're in a recession, but there is free fun.
Well, that's a rosy view.
Yes, recessions are wonderful.
You get to spend time with your family.
There's a lot of crime.
They don't get fixed.
You know, there's a thing that economists always talk about.
The effect is on the margin.
And what they mean is that an effect, a recession is not black or white.
It doesn't mean that every single person is happy during growth,
obviously, and every single person is miserable during a recession.
But I think what it means is that people who, and businesses and others,
things that are just home run successes are going to do okay.
I mean, if you're an orthopedic surgeon, you're going to be fine.
You might not make quite as much money.
If you're a nuclear physicist or if you're just a really, really good plumber or whatever,
you're going to do okay.
It's those marginal businesses that are less likely to click.
I was thinking about this in my neighborhood in Brooklyn,
which is right on the border between sort of the yuppie spread south from Park Slope
into a working class neighborhood.
And just for the last three or four years,
it's just felt inevitable that the kind of cheap lousy liquor store closes
and a fancy snobby wine store opens in its place.
The old fashioned pizza place closes and a more fashionable higher end pizza place opens.
And it just sort of felt inevitable that this yuppie spread would take over my neighborhood.
And just yesterday I was walking around and I was thinking,
oh, so that's not going to happen, at least not for a couple of years.
Because that wine store, say, or the hipster restaurant is on the margin.
It went a little bit farther than the core safe place.
Yeah, no, it's going to get reeled back in.
But in terms of Leah, I feel like what it actually means to her,
I think it means if she's in her 20s, she probably doesn't have a lot of seniority at her job.
She might be more at risk at her job because she is younger and probably less senior.
She has less experience.
And if she doesn't have a job now, it might be harder for her to find a job.
That's basically what it means.
And then it'll get better.
But it will get better.
I think even the most pessimistic views we've heard from really the darkest economists
and the darkest market players is it'll be rough for a year, a year and a half.
Right.
And it'll be like what all three of us have lived through several times.
We're still here.
In a weird way, because it happened in such a spectacular fashion this way,
this recession, I think it's more on people's minds.
You've got to get a t-shirt out of this one, Leah.
Yeah.
So one thing that marks a recession, and by the way,
that's one of the weird things about recession.
Nobody actually can tell you what it is.
Or when it begins.
Or when it begins.
I mean, there's this idea that, oh, a recession is when there's two consecutive quarters,
meaning six full months of negative economic growth.
But that's actually not what economists use.
Different people have different definitions.
Different countries have different definitions.
But one thing that seems pretty consistent is when a recession happens,
people spend less money.
And we talked to one of our favorite economists, Amir Sufi,
who teaches at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
You might remember he had a different take on the economic crisis when we talked to him last.
You posited a theory, and you said you didn't have enough data to prove it at that time.
But your theory was that what might be happening now is not entirely a financial Wall Street credit crisis,
but actually more of a standard issue elimination of consumer spending
that the American consumer is given up on buying, and that is adding to the financial crisis.
I think you can update that theory with some actual facts today.
Right. So I think, again, I want to be clear from the beginning that it's hard to argue
that the consumer is hurting for reasons that have nothing to do with the financial crisis.
Obviously, since about August of last year, it has been a lot harder to get a mortgage.
It's been harder to get a home equity line of credit.
So those things could be contributing to the drop in consumption.
But the point that I wanted to reiterate is just that household consumption,
or just how much people are buying, is one of the most important economic indicators of a recession.
And the news that came out yesterday that retail sales of businesses in the United States
for the month of September were down 1.2 percent from August
is very strong evidence that household consumption is dropping rapidly
and is probably a big reason for the stock market reaction yesterday, which was, of course, extremely negative.
Does 1.2 percent seem like a lot? Can you just help me understand that in context?
Yeah. So that's a month-on-month change. So that's just in one month, retail sales dropped by 1.2 percent.
Just to put this into perspective, consumption makes up 70 percent of GDP.
So the total output of the economy, 70 percent of that is when you and I buy things.
And can we just do a quick definition? I mean, people hear this phrase GDP all the time,
and it's the size of the economy. But what in the world does that mean?
It's basically the output of goods and services in the economy.
So it's basically made up of four main components.
Fundament spending, consumption, what you and I buy, what businesses invest,
and then net exports, which is basically what U.S. businesses export minus what we import.
So every time I buy a sandwich or a computer or go for a flight or pay for a doctor's visit,
that's dinging GDP, that's adding money to GDP.
Exactly. And ultimately, the money that you spend is money somebody else is earning
in the aggregate scheme of things. If you want to take the extreme,
it's kind of a measure of how our standard of living is going up because it's a measure of how much income
we're making based on what other people are buying from us.
And that number that represents the health or the size of the U.S. economy,
the biggest chunk of that number by a long shot is consumer spending, is people buying stuff.
Exactly. Exactly. About 70 percent.
And that's not every country, right? The U.S. is higher than other countries?
I think it is higher than other countries. But every country,
I think the primary component would be consumption. I think we're on the higher end of that.
And that's being reflected by the fact that part of the reason the world economy is getting very worried
is because the U.S. consumer is the ultimate buyer of a lot of goods from all across the whole world.
So it's not just that the consumer affects the U.S. economy.
The U.S. consumer actually affects the world economy in a pretty deep way.
But I think I derailed you from Laura's question.
1.2 percent, how much is that? When was the last time we dropped 1.2 percent?
So I don't know that exact number, but just to put it into perspective,
when we talk about GDP growth, we talk about how much did the economy grow.
And there we're talking about a change from 2 percent positive growth to negative 1 percent,
like a shrinking, that's a major recession.
So if you want to put 1.2 percent into that perspective,
if consumption falls by 1.2 percent for the quarter at an annualized rate,
so that's a huge change in GDP.
That can definitely take us from a moderate recession to a very severe recession.
Wait, are we in a major recession in your opinion?
I don't want to say what's the qualification of major versus minor,
but I won't be surprised if the third quarter GDP numbers come out
and show pretty sharply negative growth.
I don't want to make a specific prediction,
but I think it's safe to say that this drop in retail sales for September,
which is of course the last month of the third quarter.
So taking together the evidence from July, August, and September
suggests that consumption could be really bad for the third quarter,
which would of course put us definitely in recession territory.
And if it continues, a lot of times a severe recession is not so much the one quarter drop,
but then the length of how long it lasts.
And these are bad numbers because what's going to happen now
is businesses really are going to start cutting back on inventory investment,
on capital expenditures.
Those are also part of GDP,
and so you see there's going to be probably a pretty sharp contraction.
So that's the ripple effects.
I don't go to the store and buy a computer.
I actually, truthfully, last week I was going to upgrade my computer and buy a new one,
and I decided not to and stick with my old one,
even though it's kind of slow and broken.
It's your fault, Adam.
It's my fault, exactly.
But that's what we're talking about, people making decisions like that.
I was in P.C. Richards, which is a big electronics store,
discount store on this Sunday,
and normally Columbus Day weekend Sunday, I mean, you couldn't move through that store.
It was empty.
I'd asked some of the salesmen, they said just nothing was moving.
So 1.2 percent, it sounds like not much, but it is something you can feel and see.
Right, definitely.
The U.S. consumer in some ways through this whole crisis may have been our last hope.
Could it be that people continue to buy,
even though their housing prices have gone down,
even though gas prices have gone up,
even though they can't access home equity lines of credit or a second mortgage?
It could be.
Maybe they would still scrap together the money to buy things,
but we're starting to see evidence now that they are not buying things,
and that's the real worry going forward.
Can you help me understand something I'm getting on the blog,
which is people are saying,
hey, we're being told we're living beyond our means,
and we need to stop spending money and save.
And then somebody like you comes along and says,
hold on everybody, you've got to get out there and spend money.
You're the last hope of the global economy.
Well, I'll be clear.
I'm not saying I think people should spend money.
I don't know if they should.
All I'm saying is mechanically, if people stop saving money,
the economy is going to go into, at least in the short run,
could be quite bad for the economy.
But let me be clear about something.
There is no doubt that from 2001 to 2006,
a lot of my research shows that people were getting terms on their mortgages,
on their home equity lines of credit that were historically good,
meaning they were able to borrow a lot of money,
the advent of subprime lending, et cetera.
There isn't yet to be academic research that I think convincingly demonstrates
that that led to higher consumption, but it probably did.
I think we're safe to say, you know,
if I can easily take out a home equity loan
and I can get an outrageously low interest rate on my house,
I might use that money to redo my kitchen or buy a new TV.
So I agree with what you're reading on your blog,
that we're naturally in for a correction in consumption.
We simply were probably living beyond our means, is a nice way to put it.
The question is, can we smooth it on the way down?
That's really the question.
Do we want it to all just crash or do we want to try to smooth it in some way?
And I think that is partially the purpose of the politicians in D.C.
They're trying to think of ways,
we know we need to adjust our consumption levels to lower levels.
How do we do so in a way that doesn't lead to a severe contraction?
And that's basically an issue of time?
Do we do the adjustment in a few months or in a few years?
Right.
For example, one of the reasons they justify giving out rebates
or giving out fiscal stimulus by sending checks out that rebate your taxes
is to try to get people to buy a little more than they otherwise would
so that you kind of smooth it.
So that you cut back a little this month and a little next month
rather than just completely not buying anything this month.
Have you done anything in your home?
Are you cutting back on spending?
You know, we just had a baby in August, or in July,
and it's just, I don't even know, it's that time with a three-month-old baby,
I don't even know if we pay much attention.
So to be honest, I think we have cut back here and there,
but it hasn't been something, you know,
when all you're doing is going to bed every night at 10 p.m.
because you're exhausted, you're not going out to dinner
or to movies or anything else anyway.
But your diaper purchases are way up.
Yeah, my diaper purchases are still pretty constant.
Thanks to Amir Sufi and his new family
for at least easing the drop in consumer spending a little bit.
So, you know, I was wondering this week about,
there's all these words that you hear during this financial crisis
that you haven't heard before, like leverage.
I know we're going to be talking about leverage soon
and equity and all these plans.
One of the words is balance sheet.
Everybody's talking about balance sheet.
The balance sheet is damaged. The balance sheet needs to be repaired.
And I realize I don't really know what a balance sheet is.
So I called up a professor at Columbia University, Partha Mahanram,
and he is an expert on balance sheets.
He was given to me as an expert on balance sheets.
That's so cool.
Yeah, and I started off by asking him just,
what is a balance sheet?
Okay, let's say you and I start a bank.
Right.
All right?
So what we do is, let's say you put $50 in and I put $50 in.
Okay.
So right now the balance sheet is going to look like the following.
We're going to have only one asset, which is cash of $100,
and all that's going to be in the liability side
is going to be owner's equity of $100.
Okay.
So let's say we do this and we start a bank.
So wait, just stop right there because now we're getting into,
I believe it's called a cruel accounting, right?
Where the both sides, is that correct?
Well, we haven't reached a cruel...
It's a double ledger accounting, basically.
Double ledger, right?
Double entry bookkeeping.
Double entry bookkeeping, yeah.
Okay, so when you and I, we have $100 and we put it in
and it goes on both sides of the balance sheet.
Absolutely.
So basically the $100, right now I haven't lent any money out yet.
It's just cash.
Okay.
Okay?
And the $100 on the other hand is owner's equity
because that's the money we as owners have put in.
I see.
Okay.
Now let's just take this.
I'm going to take this through two more steps
so this point becomes very clear.
Okay?
Let's just say we open branches
and let's just ignore the cost of the branches right now
just to make things easy.
Okay.
And let's say we raise $900 in deposits
from customers.
Okay.
Okay, instantaneously our balance sheet's going to look something like
cash, $1,000
because the $100 we put in and the $900 we raised from the others.
And then we're going to have liabilities of $900
which is the money we owe to all these depositors.
Right.
And the owner's equity, which is our money, which is $100.
Okay.
Okay.
So that's step one is just starting the bank.
Right.
Step two is getting deposits.
Mm-hmm.
Let's do step three.
Step three is we start lending money out.
Okay.
Let's say we keep a $100
because we need to have some money just in case
people want to take their money out.
Right.
And let's say we deploy $900 as loans.
Okay.
To banks or, sorry, to corporations which need money.
Okay.
Then the $1,000 of cash on my balance sheet
on the asset side
just became cash $100
I have an asset, like a loan asset, of $900.
I see.
Okay?
But there's no change on my liabilities side.
I still have liabilities of $900
which are the deposits of all the people.
Right.
And have owner's equity of $100.
Okay.
So that's fundamentally how a bank is.
Now if you think about what this $900 on the,
if you think about the liability side of the balance sheet,
I have liabilities of $900, I have owner's equity of $100.
The ratio of these two is what people refer to as leverage.
I see.
Okay.
It's like I've put in a hundred of my own money
as the owner of the bank.
I've also put in $900 of somebody else's money,
outsider's money.
So the more the outsider's money,
in some sense, the more levered a bank is.
So obviously in that example,
in our sort of little theoretical example,
the leverage would be nine to one.
We have $100 of our own money,
$900 of somebody else's money.
And most banks obviously are very different than that
in that they have lots, lots more money
and they have lots,
and the things they do with it is much more complicated.
They can loan it to corporations,
they can loan it to people,
they can buy assets,
they can buy all sorts of stuff.
But basically, he said,
you know, I asked him, like, is this,
is it basically, this is basically the way it is
even on a big bank.
And he said, yeah, I mean, basically,
a balance sheet is a balance sheet,
and that's how it looks.
And then, and he actually proved it to me.
Let me just go to Edgar
and try to download the latest balance sheet.
Sure, sure. Yeah, yeah.
And then we can do that.
Okay, great. Yeah, yeah.
We can just, we can hang this for a second.
Go ahead and do that.
I'll just wait.
So what are you doing right now?
You're going to a website?
Yeah, I'm just going to the,
the SEC has a website called the Edgar database
where you can essentially get the 10Ks
of whatever company you want to look at.
And a 10K is a financial statement?
Yeah, 10K is essentially the, is the full,
it's like the annual report,
but the, the full, the full-form financial report,
annual report.
So Morgan Stanley.
Okay.
Let's see what they have.
10Q.
Let's look at the 10Q,
which is a quarterly report on October 9th.
Okay.
So that's going to be as hot of a process
as you can get.
So it's probably for the quarter ended in,
as of August 31st, 2008.
Okay.
So, so you have the Morgan Stanley.
Is it downloaded now?
I have the Morgan Stanley balance sheet in front of me.
Okay.
So what does it, what does it show us then?
What's on their liability side?
Okay.
Morgan Stanley had assets,
total assets of $987 billion.
Okay.
As of August 31st, 2008.
Okay.
So that's, that's $987 billion of money
that they've either loaned to people
or invested in things.
They probably haven't loaned
because they're not really a bank.
Right.
So yes.
Of money that they've invested in various.
Right.
Securities and bonds.
This is all of the money they've deployed basically.
Okay.
And so how has that broken down?
So of that $987 billion,
where did, where is that?
Where did it go?
They have financial instruments owned at fair value,
$371 billion,
of which corporate and other debt is 118.
So this is basically money
they've lent out to other people.
Okay.
I wonder why Morgan Stanley's lent money out.
Maybe they have lent out, not as a bank,
but lent to other financial institutions, I guess,
just as banks lend to each other and stuff.
Mm-hmm.
They have some government securities,
other sovereign government obligations.
So the financial instruments at fair value is $371 billion.
So that's about a third,
and that's financial,
and that includes corporate bonds
as well as government debt?
Yes, but these are assets, remember.
Right.
They bought.
Other people owed them in some sense.
Yeah, yeah.
So they bought some.
They bought some securities.
Some hundred billion.
And they probably bought some corporate debt.
Right, okay.
And so on and so forth, right?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Then the other big thing is they have this thing
called collateralized agreements,
where securities purchased under agreements
to resell $179 billion.
I need to know exactly what this is.
I'm wondering if this has some of these,
what they call problematic assets
will fall under that category.
And there's something called securities borrowed
of $241 billion.
That's the other two big things.
Those two add up to a little more than $400 billion.
Mm-hmm.
So basically, that's the balance sheet.
Everything else is like premises
and small customer receivables and stuff,
but that's all like $10, $20 billion.
It's not a big deal, really.
So basically, they have $300 billion
in just sort of straight-ahead bonds,
either government or...
So they have like $371 billion in that.
In government bonds and corporate bonds, basically.
Government bonds, corporate bonds,
all those kinds of things,
contract derivatives, contracts.
And they have around $420 billion
in collateralized agreements.
I'm just trying to...
And these are things that even finance professors
like you have to sort of try to figure out
what that means.
Well, absolutely, because you don't know
exactly what goes into that.
So this is probably the CDOs and stuff,
the collateralized debt obligations and stuff.
Mm-hmm.
That's probably where those things lie.
So in this $400 billion,
that's where the mess is, basically.
That's my guess, because, I mean,
they don't call it CDOs, per se,
in the balance sheet.
They call it collateralized financing.
Mm-hmm, and CDOs, we should say,
are what everybody's talking about
as the toxic assets,
the assets that have lost a lot of their value,
if not a lot of their value.
Potentially, and that's...
If you look at Morgan Stanley's case,
it appears to be more than half the balance...
around half the balance sheet, right?
Wow.
Now, at the very minimum,
what we can do is...
Oh, we can look at...
We should also look at the liability side
of the balance sheet, right?
Mm-hmm.
Just to get a complete sense
of what's going on.
Right.
And if I look at the liability side,
the two single largest numbers
on the liability side
is $202 billion of long-term borrowings,
which is the debt
that they've actually used
to finance their business.
Mm-hmm.
And $315 billion of payables to customers.
Mm-hmm.
And I'm guessing that these are just money
they owe to some of the, you know,
maybe potentially some of the counterparties
in some of these deals.
I'm not 100% certain
what exactly this is.
Okay.
Now, I mean, we should point out
that we're not saying, obviously,
that Morgan Stanley is in this position at all.
This is just an example.
This is just a very, very theoretical conversation.
And in fact, it's entirely possible
that what we're talking about
on Morgan Stanley's balance sheet,
that $400 billion block of stuff
that they don't know...
It's hard to tell what it is,
that could have already...
That's already been written down,
and maybe it's actually worth more
than $400 billion.
Maybe they've written it down so much
that it's actually worth more
and that the value will come back.
So there's no way to actually say,
if it's going to deteriorate in value
or if it's actually going to go up in value.
See, I get this question from people on the blog.
They want to say,
can you show me whether I can see...
Can you show me how to see
if my bank is solvent?
And it looks like here you could
go and look at the balance sheet online
for your bank
and still have no idea what you were looking at.
Right.
And that's what...
And this is one of the leading experts.
This is one of the leading experts
in the country.
And it's one of those things
where entire classes are taught
on balance sheet analysis.
And what you're trying to do
is just figure out
in what kind of shape the company's in.
You can't really tell from the balance sheet,
apparently.
You have to really dig
and you have to look at footnotes
and they're very long.
It's just...
I think that's one of the things
that's contributing to this whole mess
is that companies have to release
this paperwork.
But then looking at the paperwork,
you still can't really tell that much.
I keep being amazed in this whole crisis
how much you have to learn
and how it kind of gets exciting to learn it.
It's like there's a mystery novel we're living in
and the clues are buried deep inside of stuff
that's available for free on the internet
that has been around us our whole lives.
I mean, we could have read a book
on bank balance sheets at any point in our lives,
but never really wanted to.
But it's...
I find it...
I mean, just that part of it,
the intellectually curious part of my brain,
there's something very exciting.
You know, you and I started
and we just tried to figure out
what a mortgage-backed security is
a year or two ago,
but that wasn't enough.
We had to figure out
what the derivatives of mortgage-backed securities are.
Well, I had to figure out what a security was.
And what a mortgage was.
That's where I was starting.
Exactly.
Anyway.
So the adventure continues.
We might have been stretching people's patience
with the balance sheet segment there,
but yeah, I think it is like...
It's exactly right.
It's a mystery novel, sort of, you know,
piece of generalized clues.
Maybe not the best written mystery novel,
but it affects our lives in a very real way.
Anyway, that is Planet Money for today, October 16th.
I did want to say while we have been recording this,
the Dow closed 400 points up today.
The last time I checked, it was way down.
So the volatility continues.
I guess a lot of people will be glad to hear it ended up.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conoway, Alex Bloomberg.
It's always great to have you.
It's great to be here.
Great.

I’m Adam Davidson and I am Laura Conaway. It was Joe the very famous plumber. You just heard we join today is Thursday, October 16 it’s about 10 to 4 in the p.m. here in New York and give us the planet money indicator/I wanna bring in our buddy Tom corona from tradition angel securities. He is on the front lines of the credit crisis Tom our banks lending to each other yet or the bank bucket. It’s still frozen  Sporadic lending in the very short area of one month we haven’t seen really any three months, six months understand exactly what the guarantees on the banks are yet and I guess they’re just trying to get a grasp on exactly what the plan is on guaranteeing the interbank senior death market, but most of the money for Cak , I’m still refraining from buying any type of bank that in the bank either on a positive note commercial paper for market to have started to trade out with a little bit more liquidity with the CP in corporate name and money from buying limited amounts out to three months so if it if there is some light at the end of the tunnel do you think it’s that the money market and the other investors he has the pump and soffit people haven’t figured it out yet or maybe the problem hasn’t been sold I think it’s a combination of both but I really do think it be fun to Sheldon don’t really understand exactly where the guarantees are and he still are wary and I’m not trusting again today UPS getting a $60 billion capital injection and had lunch and stuff in the paper  the pharmacy investors are healed in a perfect example of this is the treasury bill market the short film by trading with a negative yield in one hour last week and about two weeks ago we had the first pick down tree. The stock market is it hasn’t happened since the Great Depression and is it basically people willing to apply at an asset  get that money back in two weeks three weeks and they’ll except small negative return for the safety of what time corona. Thank you so much. Are you depressed us in a different way every time we talk thank you very much I can’t wait for the phone call to tell you that everything is fixed and it’s time to get back and let’s hope that next week all right thanks Tom corona of tradition Asia securities. Thank you  little man thanks for the bankers needs to borrow some money Tom Feronik will get money through Vons. Basically short term Barnes from either another bank or one of these money market funds and he’s just sitting there not doing anything with Alex Tino in his office light easily create billions of dollars a day huge office hundred percent dictators do you know  this organization or just giving it to the US government so when he was saying that treasury bonds were trading negative normally even if you’re going to lend to the US government 1%, 3% something small people are willing to let US government and lose money, because they feel confident that at least they will get some of the money back. That’s that is a fair that is quality  right to keep it in cash. If you just gonna get negative cash your deposit that Cak guy put it somewhere that’s not cash and our other planet money indicator to Ted’s Brandon talk a lot about which measures how banks are or are not lending tree chowder it’s it it actually got a little better yesterday  and today is better so it’s still about four which is a troubling number very troubling we went that way sparkly one yes currently high fall 6% better so heavy and we want it to fall 80% 75% poor more moving there is another indicator that came out today which is the consumer price index and that is also on that that is also a Salah next bag came out  as inflation measures and everybody thinks that inflation is low that’s good. It was a fabulous anything more for sandwiches cars wonderful day you would think the family yeah that’s the problem is that it on the other side of inflation is deflation worse and deflation hasn’t really happened in this country since again , the question is when it’s just when prices go down day after day down and the reason that seems like well it is a good thing in a very, very limited context, but it’s not actually actual depletion that is not simply prices things becoming worth more fordable, that is an actual monetary problem and what it means is basically everything‘s prices going down high school down the thing that you can as a company the thing that you can sell for five dollars today for four dollars tomorrow so you’re making  and then if you’re making this money you can only pay it workers and they can fix stuff and then and more and you also have an incentive not to invest cause why build a factory for $100 million to make goods that are gonna cost less in the factory I’ll be worth less than 100 right and then if there’s less investments and then also if you can today, so there is really it just turns into a downward spiral very very quickly, so that is why the Alyssa , that’s why everybody there was there where is it proven to be tragically not on target at the wrong thing about the wrong thing I don’t worry about depression and I’m gonna worry about it. I think it’s been for the last couple weeks day. Do you want to scare and depressor Alyssa Smith slightly different wet now it should be put out that the Internet depression the Fed didn’t do all the things , they are on the big kiss. Not gonna worry about the great depression. I’m gonna worry about. I’m getting a lot of this on the block question from Leah home in Portland Oregon. He is in the late 20s. Poor thing I’m too young. A recession I know that there has been , and now I am old enough to be if I could buy them and I have no idea what a recession Lee in my every day life I’m gonna have that brand is gonna be really expensive. Is it mean that to be totally insane does it mean that all the restaurants and bars in my town are going to go under and some of them are going to go under it doesn’t mean you know I think we were all alive in the late 70s we’re all alive , yeah that’s when I graduate that is in my memory if that’s my basic adult time ever gotten no jobs and there was a feeling I’m gonna think I think of that feeling I always have been always will be sick and imagine feeling well and that’s what I remember in 1991 is pressing, feeling that whatever happened in America when young people had a dream and vision  assess that phase of America is over. It’s just miserable slog with a dark future. You have a much more macro view of it. I remember thinking like oh it’s I just thought that was the way it wasn’t you cause I didn’t fully feel as if you’re even really in , but I remember it later in the 90s when we were out of a recession and I would start meeting kids and they’re like 23 and they’re graduating from college and it’s like jumping into the job market and get lots of lots of money and that’s when I realized oh I graduated during the  recession that’s what that was. You know I didn’t really notice the recession recession that I was I’ve lived through in terms of crisis so much I actually felt like I had plenty of money I worked very little and I lived in a really cheap little $200 room in an apartment in San Francisco . It mean you just didn’t have a ton of money but you had a lot of time and I notice now in my neighborhood or families out doing things like ;-) father will pick up games going on. In the parks. There is free fun well listen Rosie view yes for sessions are wonderful. Time with your family cry 16 there’s a thing that I converse , it’s the factors on the market and what they mean is that a fact it doesn’t recession is not black or white it doesn’t mean that every single person is happy during growth in every single person is miserable during session, but I think what it means is that people who and businesses and others things that are just home run successes are gonna do OK Europe, orthopedic surgeon  quite as much money if you’re if you’re just a really really good plumber or whatever you’re gonna do OK if it’s those marginal businesses that are less likely to click I was thinking about this in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, which is right on the border between sort of the yuppie spread south park slope into a working class neighborhood, and just for the last three or four years it’s just felt inevitable that you know what kind of cheap lousy liquor store closes in a fancy snobby wine store, open place the old fashion pizza place closes in the morning  fashionable higher in the pizza place open in evitable that the yuppie spread would take over my neighborhood and just enough for a couple years or restaurant is on the margin if it went a little bit farther than the core safe and feel like actually like what it actually means to her I think it means you know she’s in her 20s doesn’t have a lot of shit ready to job might be harder  than her job because she is like younger and probably senior. She has less experience and to find a job but it will get that even the most pessimistic views we’ve heard from really the darkest darkest market players is it’ll be rough for a year or year and a half right but it’ll be like what we would all three of us have left  yet because it happened in such a spectacular fashion this way so to one thing that marks, the recession actually tell you what it is two consecutive quarters meaning 64 months negative economic growth different people have different definitions, different countries of different definitions, but one thing that seems pretty consistent is it is a recession and people spend less money and we talk to one of our favorite  Chicago graduate school of business are you Mike remember he had a different take on the economic crisis you posited a theory when you said you didn’t have enough data to prove it at that time, but your theory was it what might be happening now is not entirely a financial Wall Street credit crisis, but actually more of a standard issue by elimination of consumer spending the 350 American consumer it is given up on buying and that is adding to the financial crisis. I think you you can update that Siri what’s an actual fast right so I think I can I want to be clear from the beginning that it is hard to argue that the consumer is hurting for reasons that have nothing to do with the financial crisis obviously since about August of last year‘s been a lot harder to get a mortgage is been hard to get home  credit so those things could be contributing to the drop in consumption at the point that I wanted to reiterate it’s just that alcohol consumption or just how much people are buying is one of the most important, economic indicators of recession and the news that came out yesterday that retail sales United States for the month of September we’re down 1.2% from August is very strong evidence that the health of deduction is dropping rapidly and it’s probably a big reason for the stock market reaction for Yesterday  like a lot can you just help me understand that yeah so that the month on month came in one month retail sales dropped by 1.2% specter consumption makes up 70% of GDP to the total output of the economy 70% of that is win can we just do it quick definition  all the time and it’s the size of the economy, but when the world is basically the output of goods and services in the economy, so it’s basically made up of four main component government spending consumption you what you and I by what business is in debt, and then net export  export minus what we import so every time I buy a sandwich or a computer or go for a flight or pay for a doctors visit that’s a Dengan Jaya VPSs, adding money exactly and ultimately the money that you spend is that his money somebody else is hurting him a thing  as kind, a measure of how our standard of living is going off because it’s a measure of how much income we’re making based on what other people are buying and that number that represents the health or the size of the US economy the biggest chunk of that number by a long shot is consumer spend  exact exact about 70% and that’s not every country right that’s the US is higher than other country. I think it is higher than other countries but every country I think the primary component would be I think we’re on the higher end of that but nothing reflected by the fact that part of the reason world economy is getting very worried because the US consumer is the ultimate buyer of a lot of good from all of across the whole world, though it’s not just that the consumer affects you  the world economy but I think 1.2% how much is that when was the last time we drop 1.2%, so oh I don’t know that exact number but just to put it in perspective when we talk about GDP growth we talk about how much did the economy grow and there were talking about a change from 2% positive growth to -1%  That’s a major recession so if you want to put 1.2% into that perspective is consumption, followed by 1.2% for the quarter or add an annualized rate so if that’s a huge change in GDP that can definitely take us from you know a moderate recession  in your opinion we I I don’t want it they made you know what the qualification a major versus minor, but I won’t be surprised if the third quarter GDP numbers come out and show in a pretty sharp and I don’t wanna make it but I think it’s safe to say that there’s drop in retail therapy for September is the last month of the third quarter, and taken to gather the evidence from July August, September suggested  for the third-quarter which would’ve caught definitely a recession per territory and if it continues a lot of time does severe recession it’s not so much does 1/4 draw but then the length of how long it lasts I need a bad number because it’s gonna happen now I’m back on inventory indefinite on capital those are also part of GDP until you see that  so that’s the ripple effect I don’t go to the store and buy a computer I actually truthfully last week I was going to upgrade my computer and buy a new one and I decided not to and stick with my old one even though it’s kind of slow and broken, is your fault, Adam is my father  that’s what we’re talking about people making decisions like that I was in PC Richards, which is a big electronics store on Sunday and normally Columbus Day weekend Sunday I mean you couldn’t move through that store empty just nothing is moving so so 1.2% it sounds like not much but it is something you can feel and see right definitely humor in someway through the whole crisis may have been our last hope , I even though their housing prices are going down they can’t access credit or a second mortgage I think but we’re starting at the avenues now that they are not my thing I am not worried can you can you help me understand something I’m getting on the block which is  saying hey, we’re being told we’re living beyond army and we need to stop spending money and sake and then somebody like you comes along is hold on everybody you got to get out there and spend money is the last hope for the global economy well, I’m on the clear I’m not saying I think people should I don’t know if they should all I’m saying is mechanically if people start saving money economy is going to go in  short run of the quite bad for the clear about something there is no doubt that from 2001 2006 a lot of my research shows that people were getting term on their mortgages on their home equity line of credit that work historically good meeting they were able to borrow a lot of money  etc. there isn’t yet to the academic research that I think convincingly demonstrates that that lead to higher consumption, but it probably did. I think we should if I can easily take out a home equity loan, and I can get an outrageously low interest rate on my house. I might use that money to redo my kitchen or buy a TV  so I agree with what you’re reading on your blog that we’re naturally in for a correction in consumption we simply were probably living beyond our mean put it the question is can we smooth it on the down on the on the way down that’s really the question do we want it all just crash or do we want to try to move it in someway, and I think that is partially the purpose of the politician  they’re trying to think of ways you know we need to adjust our consumption level. How do we do so in a way that doesn’t and that’s basically the shop time do we do the adjustment in a few months in a few years right? For example, one is one of the reasons they justify giving out rebates  sending checks out hacker is to try to get people to buy a little more than the other white wood so that you kind of fluid that you cut back a little bit more than a little next month rather than just completely not buying anything this month have you done anything in your home to you cutting back on spending are you do you do you know we just had a baby in August so I have your in July I don’t even know if you had that that time with a three month old baby I don’t even know if we  I think we have cut back you’re there but it happens when all you’re doing is going to bed every night at 10 PM to view exhausted but your diaper my diaper purchases are still pretty hot. Thanks to Oma Sisi and his new family for at least easing the drop in consumer spending so you know is what I was wondering this week about that you were hit with  her before it leverage equity and all this planned what are the words of balance sheet really no what about she is so caught up a professor at Columbia University press the bottom and a he is an expert as an expert yeah and I and I said what is OK back all right, so what are you doing , OK look like a follow it legal to have only 100 and old equity of 100. OK OK start a bank stop right there because now we’re getting into into into into the besides that correct double ledger account double ledger, right OK so when I saw it when you and I we have $100 that goes on both sides OK so basically right now I haven’t left the money. I’ll give it to Dhika , OK let’s just take this trip open. The open branches raise $900 in deposit from customer OK OK instantaneously thing like cash 1000 of 900 which is the money we owe to all the red and the owners equity which is our money which is 100 OK OK  vike’s getting the closet OK let’s say we keep $100 for money just in case you want to take the money out red nine $900 lol OK to find Jog 22 corporation wish need money OK then cash on my balance sheet of the appetite, cash hundred and I have an asset like a lunatic of 900 I said OK no change on my liability state liabilities of 900 people and have owners equity offer of 100. OK our banker think about what is 900 I have liabilities of 901 equity of 100  leverage. Hi Siri my own money address as the owner of the bank I want to put in $900 of somebody else’s money outside of money money in something to mourn leveled a bank so obviously that that example in our in our Nlsub theoretical example, and most things obviously are very different than that and that they have lots lots more money and they have lots in the the things they do with it , but basically he said you know I asked him like is this is it is it basically basically and then let me just go to download the app and then you can do that I just wait, so what are you doing right now he can care of it is a full report, but the full report a new report for Morgan Stanley  quarterly report on October 9 as part of the better that you can get Puspa this quarter and it in as of August 31, 2008 OK so you have the Morgan Stanley only had half of $987 billion OK $987 billion loan to people or invested in things  invested in various right OK enter how is that broken down to the Avenue that nine $87 billion went where did where is it? Where did it have financial instrument owned a fair value 371 billion a fish corporate another deck is 118 by the people I want to buy Morgan punishment money out. Maybe they have lent out not as a bang but  a death and government securities other foreign government obligations for the financial in Tubun Satria Jalan, 371 billion to the third and it’s financials and that includes corporate bonds as well as government debt debt. They bought bought them for Curity some heroin probably bottle copper that vegan Sendy  flashlight agreement that security agreement to reset 179 billion views from a view what they call problematic as it will fall under the category of security borrowed of 241 billion but the other two big things around billion everything else would like to know :-) really so basically so basically at 300 billion in a straight ahead bonds in a cup in pounds $120 billion in call Ashley is agreement and these are things that are art that even finance professors like you have to serve like try to figure out with that  that he was going into that video application does Petaluma is 400 billion that’s with a message in the in the calculator less financing it appears to be know what we can do is look at the reliability rack numbers on the liability Faye yes to Billy dollars off $15 billion of cable to customer  money way over to Canada maybe put it no I meant but at the end 400 is that could’ve already that’s already down and he does actually work more. I get this question from people on the block they want to say can you show me were there I can see you show me how to see if my bank is soft and it looks like here you could go and look at the balance sheet  online for your bank right in what you’re trying to do is figure out what kind of cancer that I think that’s one of the things I keep saying basically from this whole crisis how much how much you have to learn how exciting to learn it it’s not over living in in the crews are very inside and stuff that’s available  for free on the Internet but that has been around us. Our whole lives really wanted to but but it’s him I find it I’m just that tired of it the intellect truth. Part of my brain started that wasn’t it up you have to figure out what the derivatives of mortgage back securities , yeah anyways that that is planet money for today October 16. I just want to say wow we have been reporting this detail close 400 points up today. Last time I checked way down I am Adam Davidson and I’m Laura Conaway it was great to have you here you can follow planet money npr.org/money .
