Five school districts in Wisconsin borrowed, invested and lost an awful lot of money. A few months ago, the IMF was laying off workers. Now it's scrambling to save the world. And a listener checks in with a picture from the local coffee shop.

**(Laura Conaway):**

You've taken all this time to create this resume to make sure it looks very professional.
And then, people fold it up in tiny little bits and stick it in an envelope and mail
it off to the employer.
When the employer receives it, this very carefully crafted piece of artwork is all
scrunched up.
We've once again landed on NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Laura Conaway.
Today's Monday, November 3rd.
It's about 3 31 p.m. here in New York City.
And Laura, as you know, this is the week we are launching our big collaboration with
the New York Times that we have been hinting at for some time.
It's about some schools in Wisconsin that bought some of the worst of the toxic assets
sold by Wall Street and how that rippled around the world and connected these small school
districts into a global financial system in crisis.
We will talk about that today and probably a bit all week.
Yeah, these guys lost a whole, whole lot of money.
We're also going to talk today about the International Monetary Fund.
That's the IMF.
We're going to talk about what it is, what it's doing and what it needs in order
to keep doing everything that the countries of the world seem to be asking of it
right now.
Adam, some planet money indicators.
Yes, today it's a real world planet money indicator, our favorite planet money indicator.
The TED spread is down about 8 percent today, which is very good, but it's a little less
dramatic than the planet money indicator we got from listener Andy Waschkowitz.
He's a biology graduate student in upper Manhattan, studying how the heart develops
and works.
Andy sent us a picture recently from his neighborhood up there in Morningside Heights.
So I sent a picture of a line snaking out of my morning coffee place, and I had noticed
that a couple weeks ago the line started growing and growing and growing.
And usually it's just because Columbia students are coming back to school.
But I went in and I asked the people how come I had to wait for so long, and they
said that one of the morning coffee people had been fired.
And so because there were only two people now, it took much longer for the line to
move forward.
Now fired because of cause or laid off because of the economy?
So not coming back?
Yeah, definitely not coming back.
And I've noticed that there's only been two in the couple of weeks since I originally
sent the picture.
And it was crazy, because as I noticed, as I wrote in the email, they got rid of
one person, and so now the line is getting longer.
And I've noticed that people in the line are just saying nuts to this, and they're
getting out of line and going to another place.
And sooner or later they're going to be making less money, and then they're going
to have to fire another person.
And so it's interesting how the economy works that this perception that they have
to fire people is now going to lead to the reality that they're going to have
to fire more people.
Right.
I got to say that as a business reporter, it's always hard to tell if one
particular thing, one particular data point is just a really bad business
person or a problem in the economy overall.
But why are people waiting in line there?
Is their coffee particularly delicious or cheaper?
I find their coffee particularly delicious.
I guess that other people find it somewhat expendable and can go to another
place down the street.
But yeah, I mean, their regular coffee is quite good.
And also I noted in the email also that I was asking one of the coffee
making type people, and they were saying that a lot less people are getting
the fancy coffee drinks and the lattes and the Americanos and whatnot and a
lot more are opting for the drip coffee.
And I know that when I got out of college and I sort of had to start
budgeting myself, I know the lattes were the first thing to go.
What are you getting now?
Just normal drip coffee, half calf with skim milk.
Got you.
I got to say, Laura, I've been noticing longer lines around my
neighborhood in Brooklyn.
Have you really?
Yeah, I definitely have.
Actually this morning I was on my way into work and I took a long walk
and I wanted to get just a little something like a coffee and a bagel or
something.
And I walked by so many places with such long lines, I just didn't get
anything.
That's interesting.
Yeah.
So I didn't do the reporting work because I'm a reporter.
So why would I have done it?
No, you're not working.
Then you're walking.
Yeah, I'm walking.
So Andy, thank you so much for doing the hard work that I failed to do
this morning.
And we want to see more of you sending us photos of the economy.
This is a perfect example.
Andy just was walking down, saw something economic going on.
He snapped a photo of his line at the coffee shop.
He asked a few questions, did some reporting.
And now we have some more information.
We would love to turn to you and ask you to do the same.
That was really helpful.
Please send in yours to planetmoneyatnpr.org.
Yep, that's where we are.
Send them on.
We really like it a lot.
Thank you.
And now it's time for the big reveal, as they say in radio.
We're going to reveal that super secret story that we've been dealing with all
this time with the New York Times.
And we were so tired from working on.
That's true.
It was a lot of work.
Still a lot of work.
It's still a lot of work, actually, because we're going to have a big
blowout 18-minute story on all things considered on Friday that
utilizes at one way or another the entire Planet Money team.
But yesterday I had a chance to talk with Leanne Hanson of Weekend
Edition Sunday with our good friend Charles Duhigg.
He's the New York Times reporter who sort of structured this story that we
worked on together.
This is a story that starts in Wisconsin with some school districts that
bought what they thought at the time was a collection of bonds.
It turns out they were wrong.
This was a collection of what we now know are some of the most toxic
assets in the economy.
But this purchase in Wisconsin set off a chain reaction that
eventually moved to Ireland and Germany and then back to the United States,
to New York, Colorado and California.
And it's had these worldwide ramifications.
And Leanne, this is Adam.
If we start with that first step in the chain, these five school
districts in the southeast corner of Wisconsin, these were school
boards trying to solve a small financial problem by making these
investments.
And what they'll now tell you is that they really didn't understand
what they were buying at all.
Here's Mark Hujic.
He's a school board member in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Unfortunately, what we thought we bought and what we bought are two
separate things.
And the information we were provided prior when we asked questions and
received answers weren't necessarily reality or the truth.
So, Charles, what were they buying?
They were buying something that school boards should never actually be
buying.
It's called a synthetic CDO.
Basically, they sold insurance on a big collection of bonds, which put
them on the hook if anything went bad.
But they didn't know that, Leanne.
This is Adam again.
They were confused, I think it's safe to say.
They just thought they were buying these regular old safe bonds.
And this particular asset that they bought came with a prospectus that
was three inches thick.
Sean Edie in Whitefish Bay actually measured it.
As a matter of fact, the document itself was so big that it didn't fit on
the shelf that I had.
I actually have had it on the floor of my office for the last two years.
You know, he shouldn't feel too bad for not understanding these things.
These are the types of investments that brought down some of the most
sophisticated banks and companies in New York.
The Wisconsin school districts were a little bit helpless.
Well, Charles, you said that this caused a chain reaction and spread
around the world.
How did that happen?
Well, the school boards had borrowed about $165 million from a small Irish
bank named Depfa.
Depfa was actually a German bank that had moved to Ireland to save
taxes.
And then in the early 2000s, it spread all around the world.
I had a talk this week with the retired head of the New York office of
Depfa.
His name's Herb Jacobs.
And he is almost, I feel like, a tragic figure.
He is so proud of what he accomplished because from 2003 to earlier
this year, he helped spearhead this small Irish bank's explosion from
nothing in the U.S.
into one of the central pillars of municipal finance, of the U.S.
municipal bond world.
Yeah, it was very exciting.
It was one of the great occupational moments in my career.
And we shared in the success with a great deal of pride and
accomplishments.
So I don't think any of us envisioned that this would become a wholesale
slaughter that it eventually did become.
What is he talking about when he says wholesale slaughter?
He's talking about how it spread from Ireland to Germany and then back to
the United States.
Depfa, that's the small Irish bank that's actually a German bank, had
made so many bad deals.
And when all the big U.S.
banks started collapsing, Depfa had started to collapse too.
And that set off a crisis.
It set off a crisis at Depfa's parent company in Germany.
It's a company named Hypo Real Estate.
It's a big bank.
German officials were so worried about a complete meltdown of the
German economy because Hypo Real Estate was melting down that they
had to pump $75 billion into all of these banks.
And that's the moment, Leanne, when the crisis in Ireland and
Germany that was started by things in the U.S.
comes back to the U.S.
Because Depfa, growing so fast, had become a crucial part of how
cities and counties and school districts and park districts fund
themselves.
Depfa had created a series of products that allowed cities and
counties and municipalities to get bonds cheaper, basically to borrow
more cheaply.
And when Depfa all but exploded, you have all sorts of
municipalities in the U.S.
having to spend a lot more money to borrow money.
So Charles found out that the MTA in New York, the people who run
our buses and subways, are having to pay millions more.
I mean, Charles and I are probably going to have to pay more every
time we go on the subway because of Depfa's explosion.
And this isn't affecting just New York, right?
Not at all.
Affordable housing in Colorado, in California.
There's a bridge project in Vancouver that's in trouble.
There are dozens, maybe hundreds, of municipal projects that are
linked to Depfa that are now in trouble because of this weird economic
international blowup.
Yeah, but Charles, explain, is there an actual bad guy in this story?
You know, I would have to say that the villain is probably ignorance.
And the exuberance that drew cities and school districts and regular
people into this big economic global system when they didn't really
understand how it worked.
And I think there is a tragedy here, too, which is over the last
30 years there's been a series of financial innovations that have just
been plain good.
They have allowed city governments, local governments, to get money more
cheaply, which means more hospitals, more schools, better sewers, you
know, basic, good public service.
And that whole system may be permanently broken by this crisis.
And that means that really for the foreseeable future, there's just
going to be less public service in the U.S.
We'll have plenty more on this story all week on Planet Money.
And as I mentioned, Alex Bloomberg, David Kestenbaum, and I will be
telling this story in detail on Friday's All Things Considered.
Caitlin, don't play the Economist House Call theme because we are
going to our Economist House Caller, Simon Johnson.
Hey, Simon.
Hi. How are you?
Good. How are you?
Good.
Good.
But today we're going to talk to you about your, one of the
other hats you have worn in your life.
You are chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
And we want to talk about how the IMF can and cannot deal with this
current crisis.
You know, Laura, I was thinking that every time I mentioned the World
Bank or the IMF or the WTO or any of these big organizations that
people have heard of, I always think it's worth starting with just
what is it?
Yeah.
What is the IMF and how is it different from some of these other
places?
Maybe the nickel tour.
Sure.
The IMF is a credit union.
Literally.
It belongs to 185 member governments.
That's almost everybody in the world.
They all chipped in some money.
Actually, the lucky early ones put in some gold back in 1945,
46, when the whole thing started going.
And its capital is the money that people have contributed and,
very importantly, its ability to draw on member governments for
further credit.
So it has supplemented its basic money, so-called quota resources,
in the past with some additional lines of credit.
And this, I think, will be an important precedent for further
ways that they could raise money.
But they're here to help.
They're supposed to support governments where no one else will
support them.
They have obviously had a bit of a bad rap in the past.
People have said they've been too tough in certain situations,
and they're trying to handle things differently this time.
But they are supposed to be like your credit union,
and you go to them when no one else will lend to you.
Simon, we've been reading about European Union finance
ministers meeting and talking about the idea of maybe a whole
new financial order, maybe a much more powerful,
much larger international monetary fund.
Is the IMF big enough to do what countries are asking it to do
right now?
And if not, how would it get more money in order to help
everybody who needs it?
The IMF is not big enough right now in two senses.
First of all, it doesn't have enough people.
And funnily enough, at the instigation of the G7,
they laid off or eased out about 20 percent of their
workforce over the past year,
because the G7 said there will never be another big crisis.
And I think a lot of those people have to be
hired back quickly.
They actually got rid of many of their most experienced
crisis managers, among other things,
because a lot of them could be enticed with early
retirement packages.
So that was unfortunate.
And you could just put that one on the G7.
When did that happen?
In the G7's account.
That process was initiated back in November of last year.
Wait, the crisis was already on us.
Well, in retrospect, I think that is how the history
books will review the evidence and make their assessment.
Yes, in retrospect, the crisis was in the G7.
And the G7 are the people, the major shareholders,
who call the shots on that sort of thing.
Yes, that was unfortunate, to say the least.
But it's okay.
You can hire the people back.
It's just money, after all.
The second thing is about money, much more money.
The IMF has about $200 to $250 billion that they can
lend right now, ready cash.
They could lay their hands on more money if they
scramble.
There's always the so-called,
they like to say they have a catalytic effect,
which means they bring in other people who are
willing to invest when the IMF has a program.
For example, for Iceland, the IMF will put in
something like $2 billion, and they hope to raise
more than that from other countries,
probably the Nordic countries.
Scandinavia would be the obvious contributors.
Well, the IMF really is a bigger fund if it's
going to protect the country.
So $250 total.
They've got $50 already penciled in or now in
$10 for various commitments to about half a
dozen countries.
The money goes quickly these days,
as you probably noticed.
They put $100 aside for a fast lane,
rapid access credit line.
That's $150 gone.
$250 available.
So you have $100 billion left to save the rest of
the emerging market world.
It's obviously not enough.
$100 billion is...
Sorry, just to put that in context.
I mean, the U.S., if you count the toxic
asset relief program and the stock injection
program, I mean, we're well in,
and if you add all the Fed liquidity projects,
we're well above a trillion, right?
We're in the trillions.
No, as I said, the Fed has made commitments.
This isn't what it will cost the taxpayer.
They've made commitments easily of 70% of GDP.
So let's call that $8 to $9 trillion commitments.
And the whole thing will end up costing the
U.S. something like 10 to 20% of GDP if things
go well.
That's the usual cost of fallout from this
kind of crisis.
So let's call that $3 trillion will end up
being added to the national debt when all
is said and done.
Kind of say a lot of money, Simon.
Yeah, $100 billion is nothing.
I mean, it's ridiculous.
Save the world $100 billion.
Well, hold on, but $100 billion won't save
the world.
What they need, I think, is substantially
more than that, and they can do it with
smoke and mirrors, but I really don't think
you want to do that.
We've tried that in the U.S. context,
in the European context.
It's high stakes poker, and people are
going to call you a bluff.
I think they need $1 trillion.
Actually, I think they need $2 trillion,
but in public I'm just saying $1 trillion
because it's a little less scary than $2
trillion.
And how do they get that?
Do they call up Hank Paulson and say,
hey, you probably have an extra $800
billion lying around.
You found $700.
Well, it's funny you should suggest
that because Gordon Brown has been
touring the Middle East making exactly
that proposal.
He's saying let's provide a, I think
what he's saying is let's provide an
additional line of credit to the IMF,
and the industrialized countries will
chip in some, but we want the big
emerging markets who hold lots of
reserves, read the Middle East plus
China, and then Japan has a trillion
dollars.
So Japan has a trillion.
China has two trillion.
The Middle East has probably 1.5
trillion in reserves.
And from those sources plus the
European Union and the U.S., you
could easily come up with a trillion,
if you really put your mind to it.
I don't think they'll do a trillion,
honestly, short term, but if they
could do several hundreds of billions
on November 15th, that would be a
very good idea.
But wait a second, Simon.
If you're going to these countries
who are already in crisis, you're
saying even the safest bank bonds
are basically not trading out of
terror.
We want you to give us a few
hundred billion to invest in
basically the most troubled
economies on Earth.
I mean, if you went to a private
company to do that, you'd need to
give, I don't know, you'd have to
give them like 80% or 300% interest.
What's in it for the
countries?
Why would they do it?
World peace, global economic
stability, save the world, keep
oil prices high.
You can look at it various ways.
OPEC can't prevent oil prices from
slumping badly.
We know they can't collude when
prices are falling.
For the Middle East, this is
their best shot at keeping
growth going.
China will be hit very hard if
all their export markets slow
down.
Same thing is true for Japan.
There's a lot of self-interest
in it.
Remember, this is money, they
have a lot of money they're
already keeping in reserves, so
they park it in U.S.
treasuries.
Lending to the IMF traditionally
has been as safe as lending to
the U.S.
Treasury.
You may be right that in this
situation there could be more
risk there, but the IMF always
gets its money back and always
pays people back.
You're asking for a line of
credit to the IMF rather than
which, so you can continue to
keep the money in your own
reserves and count it as
reserves.
It's, I agree, a fairly big
proposition, but we're facing
a big problem.
And if the emerging markets
won't come on board, it's not
clear to me that the G7, the
industrialized countries
themselves, are willing to
step up and finance the whole
bill this time.
Simon, I had one last
question.
When you get to be the
chief economist of the IMF,
how do they tell you you got
the job?
They phone me.
They gave me a phone call.
One person, phone rings?
Well, that's right.
Absolutely.
Was it the head of the IMF
or...?
The first deputy managing
director, Mr. John Lipsky,
phoned me.
And what did they say?
Congratulations.
And what do you say?
Oh, my God.
I mean...
Yes, I said I was very
excited and it would be a
great pleasure to have the
job, and I tried not to let
on that the news had already
leaked out to me a couple
of hours before.
Great.
Well, Simon Johnson is former
chief economist of the IMF.
He now teaches at MIT, and
he also has the fabulously
helpful BaselineScenario.com,
and perhaps most importantly,
he is the economist
house caller for planet money.
But today we asked him to
put on one of his other hats
and talk to us about
IMF problems.
I thought it was a house call
for the IMF.
Okay, fair enough.
Yeah, economist house call
for the IMF.
Caitlin, cue the music.
Economist house call
And thank you, Simon Johnson,
for walking us through the
IMF.
It's one of those agencies
or actors or...
I still don't even really
know what to call it,
but whatever it is,
it's always seemed kind of
vague to me.
Well, all of this stuff
can be very confusing
until it all collapses
and then it becomes
important to understand it.
So, but...
Let's wrap this podcast.
Yeah, I didn't know
where I was going,
so let's just go home.
We'll just stop.
Yeah.
Come to our blog,
npr.org slash money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Thanks for hanging out
on Planet Money.
