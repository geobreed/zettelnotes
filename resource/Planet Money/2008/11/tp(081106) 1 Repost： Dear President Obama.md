**(Adam Davidson):**

**(Laura Conaway):**

Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have
a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.
In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.
Hi, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Adam Davidson is out working on the next installment of that big story about the Wisconsin school
districts.
You remember, they're the ones who put like $200 million to, well, not really to great
use, let's just say, in the Wall Street world.
It's Wednesday, November 5th.
It's about 417 p.m. here in New York City.
We've got a very, very cool show today.
We're going to get a surprising take on how Barack Obama won the presidential election,
and we're going to hear your ideas for fixing the economy, your letters to the incoming
president.
But first, it's Dan Costello.
He's with me in the studio.
Dan, can you tell me something about this Ted spread?
You blogged something today saying basically the end of Ted's bread.
Yeah, I mean, some of the optimists on Wall Street say that there's a glimmer of
hope there.
And if you look at things like the LIBOR, which is a fancy way of saying the interest
rate that banks charge each other for.
What's it stand for, LIBOR?
It stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate.
I always do that incorrectly.
But anyways, it's just an interest rate that people look to and, by the way, the trillions
of dollars of student loans and mortgages and credit cards that died too.
So this is a very important number.
They all hang on LIBOR.
They all hang on LIBOR.
Many people who are listening to this, their loans are LIBOR plus 2 or 3 percent.
So if LIBOR goes down, your interest rates go down.
That has fallen for the 16th straight day.
It is now at its lowest level since June.
So that should translate into good things for the market.
And it should mean that the TED spread would go down because LIBOR is one of the things
that makes up the TED spread.
And the TED spread is the difference between the LIBOR and the interest rate, what we
get for T-bills.
And so people look at that spread as an indication of how healthy the market
is.
But you're most interested in LIBOR.
I'm interested in LIBOR.
I mean, I think that is the interest rate that is tied to trillions and trillions
and trillions of dollars of loans around the world.
So we called Will Last and Reese of Tradition Asial.
He's one of our favorite money market traders.
And we said, you know, hey, LIBOR is going down.
I think it's more a functionality of the swap market and rather than any type of
saturation of money in those particular periods.
Does that mean that it will eventually, that this will eventually spread into the
money market or that this might just not be a proxy of good things to come?
My point about, first of all, LIBOR is an artificially pegged rate.
It's really not indicative.
I've made the comment all this week that you could have one month, two months,
and three months money being bid for 10 percent.
In other words, you could have banks out there willing to pay 10 percent for
this money.
But because people are so afraid of taking term counterparty risk with these
banks, they're still not going to get any money.
So, I mean, if you apply the logic to the upside that banks paying 10 percent
aren't going to get money, why would LIBOR rallying going lower indicate that
banks are getting money?
To me, it doesn't.
So, you know, maybe there's stuff out there happening that I'm just not
seeing and there's flows going on that I'm just not seeing.
But I sit here and I scratch my head every day as to why the market
appears to be rallying with absolutely very little real trading occurring.
Is there anything out there that gives you a glimmer of hope?
And what would it be?
You know, yeah, oddly there is because I'm hearing people talking about
things and eventually I would think that talking about it is going to give
way to the reality of doing it.
But I mean, I have the same conversations day in and day out with
the same guys, not buying bank names.
They are buying asset by commercial paper because of the put feature to
the Fed and they are buying some very limited industrial names, usually
AAA names, usually direct issuer because of the they believe that
the counterparty risk is nil.
But I'm just not seeing the bank names trading.
Well, Aston Rees, thank you very much.
Oh, you're welcome.
Cool.
Take care.
Have a great day.
See you.
All right.
Well, Aston Rees, looking for hope.
If you follow our blog, we're at npr.org slash money.
You may have seen a post earlier today by this guy, Robert Benin
Casa, he works over at NPR in Washington and he sent us a chart
from Tuesday's election.
What it showed was Democrat Barack Obama gaining ground
in the suburbs and exurbs.
Obama did better this year than John Kerry did in 2004 in those
places, especially where you're a ring or two removed from cities.
The kinds of places that are tending to grow up very quickly, people
throwing up houses and moving there very quickly.
Robert Lang of Virginia Tech's Metropolitan Institute sees clear
reasons for voters out there changing their positions.
I mean, this is where even before the problems on Wall Street,
even for Lehman Brothers, even before, you know, the sort of
pivotal point in this election in September, the meltdown
on the markets, there was a sense in some of these suburbs
of a slide and part of it is that, you know, they're affected
by house, by gas prices because these are places where you have
more distant commutes typically and gas prices actually fed
into the declining house value because they became harder
places to reach.
So if somebody was doing a mortgage calculation and said,
well, you know, maybe what I'll do is I'll buy a bigger
house at the edge and I'll, you know, just drive more.
Well, when you throw the drive more into the mix, suddenly
the price of energy really factored in and it kind of
undermined the value in these places.
And this was this new heartland for the Republicans.
This is the way they were going to fight it out in metropolitan
areas.
They count on a very strong rural vote and they don't expect
to win anything at the center of a metropolitan area, but
they stayed competitive by winning the space in the, you
know, the kind of edges of the region.
One of the things that economists talk about, I'm very
new to economics, but I'm reading as fast as I can and
talking to as many people as I can and one of the things
they talk about a lot is life at the margins, you know,
if you can't afford to be in the center of something, then
you go to the next level out and it sounds like what
you're talking about is a kind of economic die-off or
fear or something at the margin happen that the margin
the people on the margin physically on the margin of
the map may have noticed it first.
Yeah.
And this is a place where you see foreclosures and
you see, you know, this old notion of what what was
called driving till you qualified, you know, you
couldn't afford at the center.
So you got in a car and you drove to you could buy a
place or rent a place and you were in a sense the
most vulnerable and you were especially vulnerable
if transportation costs went up and they did and then
people who might have bought your house couldn't buy
it because their transportation costs went up and
so you would vote for a candidate who addressed an
issue like change and then that's what Barack Obama
did.
He ran his campaign.
He ended his campaign in Manassas Park, Manassas,
Virginia and he won it.
I've checked the, you know, the results.
This is a county Prince William that he won.
This is a, you know, independent city as they call
them Virginia that he won.
He understood that, you know, you don't go to
Winchester, Virginia way out there in the
Shenandoah Valley and you don't go to Arlington,
Virginia, which is already in the tank for you.
You you fight it out in this kind of space where
you can see the immediate pain.
I think it's interesting that you bring up this
issue of mortgages and foreclosures because it
seemed to me that one of the things we heard a
lot from the McCain campaign was talk about
helping homeowners with mortgages.
He's very direct about it.
He did and what the problem for McCain in that
one specific area is it's not just that you
offer solutions.
It's that you offer solutions that seem to
be based on a kind of larger strategy and
McCain was throwing out stuff and for example
on that mortgage program, he modified it
several times on the fly and I think it
struck a lot of people as kind of half-baked.
So let's say for the sake of argument that
there is in fact a causal relationship between
this problem of high commuting costs and
falling home values and spike in foreclosures
in this ring of suburbia.
That's a little bit removed.
It's out on the margin.
Let's say that there is a causal relink
between that and those people voting for
Obama saying that we're going to buy the
message of change.
What do you think can be done to help those
areas and what is America going to do with
all these places that you have to drive so
far to?
I mean, what?
How are they going to fix this?
Changing energy technology, investing in
infrastructure so that you have commuter
rail and transit systems out to these
places and that's something by the way,
you know, of course we're in a situation
where we're running deficits and the
deficits we're running are substantial,
but in relative terms to the situation
the country faced after World War Two after
it had paid for a war and having been in
the depression 10 years prior to that and
deficit spent in that recession.
We're not in that bad a shape as far as
how much debt we have accumulated compared
to how large our gross national product is.
You sound like at least on this priority
of how to fix the outer suburbs that
you sound very much like you're thinking
is in line with Obama's.
Well, it's not so much that it's in
line with Obama's.
It's that Obama has captured a discussion
that has gone on among people who are
doing urban planning around the world
about which countries are investing
and which are not investing in the other
context here is that the U.S. is growing.
It's going to add a hundred million
residents between 2006 and 2039.
The census most recently improved or
shifted the year from 2043 to 2039
actually accelerated the point at which
we'd reached that no other country
in the developed world has anything
like that sort of growth.
That's like adding more than all of
Germany to the United States,
the biggest European Union nation and
mostly about 85% of that goes into the
country's metropolitan area.
So it's going to be layered atop already
densely built places.
And in that discussion, you know,
the U.S. is seen as kind of lagging
in terms of this investment compared
to developing countries like China or
even places that are, you know,
mature like Europe.
And you think that lag may have
cost McCain some votes out there.
I think the general sense of
decline in the fact that,
you know, anybody who saw the Olympics
and the kind of infrastructure that
China's building like right now,
China's share of the developed space
that they have is smaller than the
U.S. and they have rural areas that
are, you know, kind of still in
need of all kinds of improvements
and they're building an entire
interstate system and high-speed
rail. But if you take the space
they've already improved,
it's actually at a higher grade
than the U.S. If you keep expanding
that at some point, you know,
there are more developed country
than the United States.
We're right now debating a rail
out to our from our national capital
to its leading
international airport at Dulles
Airport in China.
They have a 12-minute, you know,
maglev from, you know, Shanghai
airport to city center.
They're not they're not debating
these kinds of things.
That was Robert Lang with the
news from Exurbia.
Now I want to turn to a special
production. It's a collaboration
between our own Caitlin Kenny
who produces this podcast and
makes it possible every day.
It's a collaboration between
Caitlin and you the Planet
Money listeners.
We asked for your letters to
President-elect Obama for your
ideas about what he should do to
help the economy.
Dear President Obama,
my hope is that when you leave
office in eight years,
our national debt will be smaller
than it is when you took office.
My hope is that you can find a
way to balance investments in
energy, education and infrastructure
with the principle that if
government continues to spend
more than it takes in,
it will eventually lead to ruin.
My hope is that once
the election is over,
you will come to realize that
going line by line to the
budget is a good start,
but it will not get us where
we need to go.
Our country...
Dear President Obama,
consumer spending must be addressed.
If we lose economies of scale,
more businesses will fall,
just like the automakers.
I suggest Keynesian deficit
spending on infrastructure.
We need a new electrical grid to
pump renewable energy to our homes.
We need to build wind turbines
and solar cells,
and we need new bridges and
roads and railroads.
This would create jobs and
help consumer spending by
putting money into people's hands.
The mortgage crisis needs to be
addressed.
The financial crisis won't end
until the underlying turbulence
is stabilized.
Problems like rampant foreclosure,
excessive housing inventory...
Dear President Obama,
please look beyond the greed
and single-mindedness of
most people in power to
see a few key things.
Bigger is not better.
Big insurance companies,
big banks,
big central government.
Encourage less regulations,
clean up the overgrown legal
system.
We continually add laws,
but rarely remove them.
Encourage ways small business
can network together and
work together.
Ultimately,
the strong central government
fears of the Founding Fathers
have been realized.
Dear President Obama,
two points that you will
have to do
once you become president,
right?
You will have to continue
pushing fiscal and monetary
policies in order to get
the economy moving again.
Hopefully,
a more balanced growth in
infrastructure and tangible
investment will emerge
instead of growth that is
purely reliant on financial
instruments and consumption.
And the second many point I
have to make is that as
president,
you will have to set up a
system fairly quickly to
refinance loans that
prevent outright foreclosure
and keep people in their
homes or at least...
Dear President Obama,
as far as the economy goes,
we have a horrible deficit
that needs to be addressed.
In the long run,
we need to decrease
spending and we need to
increase revenues.
It's basic math.
I think the tax plan needs
a major rewrite and small
fixes now only lead to
more broken policies to
fix later.
I'm looking at you,
AMT.
I think businesses need to
pay more taxes and I
think we should tax
spending instead of
income.
We need to spend our
money more efficiently,
especially when it comes
to health care programs.
I am dumbfounded that
we can spend gazillions
every year in the
budget and still have
an atrociously under
performing education
system,
no real plan on how to
move forward with foreign
relations and an unanswered
prayer to fix the
health system.
We need a balanced budget.
It's ludicrous to ask the
American people to get
their financial house in
order when the federal
finances are even more
out of whack.
Irresponsible credit has
torpedoed our economy
and assuming that same
line of thinking on a
national level is asking
for trouble.
I understand we'll need
to deal with it in a
short term,
but we need a long-term
plan and we need to
start working towards
that plan immediately.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Megan Barbado.
Joe Veneration.
Zane J. Tang.
Stephen Kuznack.
AJ Spotka.
Thank you all so much
for sending in those
letters.
Y'all are just the
best.
It is a pleasure to
watch them roll in and
Caitlin says the tape
was just fabulous to
hear.
You can find more
letters from listeners
like-minded and not
at npr.org
slash money.
Dan Costello,
thank you for being
here today.
Thank you.
Always a pleasure.
For now,
we're going to call
that a day on
Planet Money.
I'm Laura Conaway.
Thanks for listening.
We'll see you next time.
