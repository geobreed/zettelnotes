Billed as purely private gambles by sophisticated investors hedge funds now pose very public peril when the bets go bad
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm David Kestinbaum
It's Thursday November 13th, and it's about 2 25 in the afternoon here in Washington DC
And I'm Dan Costello. It's well to 25 in a few seconds here in New York and you heard from congressman Tom Davis there from Virginia
He was talking at a Capitol Hill hearing today
And the chairs in front of the members of Congress were filled with some of the top hedge fund managers
Representative Henry Waxman pointed out that on average they earn something like a billion dollars each
In a year and they were there because Congress is considering adding stricter
Regulations for hedge funds and the hedge fund managers said they might be willing to share their numbers about their trades with the Securities and Exchange Commission
But only if the SEC was going to keep them private it did not want those numbers made public
As for the Planet Money indicators
We looked at some of the earnings of companies that were supposed to be doing
Okay in the current financial crisis and the news wasn't so good Google stock price
It fell below $300 for the first time in five years and they also
Unofficially reported a hiring freeze this afternoon
Don't they have a lot of benefits like free sushi and car washes and oil changes and stuff like that they could cut back on
They also bus people back and forth from San Francisco with free internet
It was a great story last year about how many people at Google met each other on that bus
I thought it was I thought it was terrific
Intel said that their revenue would be a billion dollars less this quarter than they
Then they anticipated just about two months ago and even Walmart said they were suffering
They cut their revenue outlook
that's a little surprising considering, you know when the economy is bad people are supposed to look for cheaper clothes and all the other
Martha Stewart
betting etc that that
That Walmart's known for and we're also see that we have new unemployment numbers today last week another
32,000 people filed for unemployment benefits that puts the total at over a half million people and this is only the second time since
1992 that we've had over a half million people
Looking for unemployment benefits. There is one place. You might look for employment and that is with the Obama administration
Which is expected to hire something like 7,000 new people 7,000 versus half a million
Clearly exactly and so now let's talk about this big g20 meeting this weekend David you're going to this right?
I am I am gonna go there and so this is a meeting of some of the leaders from the major economies
Around the world, but you know, it's not just those 20 people coming
There are other people in town like who like this guy Kumi Naidu
He is co-chair of the global call to action against poverty
He showed up wearing a dashiki and tapping away at some blackberry thing and I asked him I said why are you here?
What are you doing here? What are you hoping for? I mean, these are world leaders coming to talk about a global economic crisis
What are you doing here this meeting as huge implications for people living in poverty around the world?
The current financial crisis is
exacerbating an already
Catastrophic situation. We know that every single day on this planet 50,000 men women and children die from
Preventable poverty related causes and we want to reverse that and this current crisis doesn't make it easier
How is it actually making things worse? So firstly
many developing country
Citizens depend on remittances from their relatives in work in rich countries
We have seen a significant decline in the amount of money sent back home
But that's still got to be a small amount of money pouring into these countries relative. Well, you know
That was the first one in some countries. It's not that insignificant. Mexico is hurting
Philippines that there are some countries which have okay quite a large number. The second impact is that we've seen
Wild fluctuations in currencies. It's still early days, but what we are seeing is
Investment is being pulled out. So that's having an impact on jobs
So what are you going to be doing this weekend during the G 20 meeting of all these countries?
Well, we've already started our work to lobby the individual government delegations. How's that going uneven?
Well, we've had a for example, we've had a conference call with the finance minister from South Africa Trevor Manuel
Just last week. Where are you actually going to be during the meeting?
Are you going to be outside the building trying to catch people as they come and go? Yes, unfortunately
Well, we'll be going in and out of hope you brought a coat. You have a short-sleeve shirt on there
Yes, no, I will be talking up for it. We have developed now a level of influence that we get very reliable
Intelligence leaks from those that are inside the meeting so that we can actually, you know
Keep the lobbying going while the meeting goes on
I could me suppose I made it from the G 20 to the G 21 and I gave you a special pass and you could
Actually go sit there at the table. What would you tell them? What would you ask them first? I would say
Recognize that just as you are concerned about people in rich countries hurting which we are also concerned about
recognize that people in poor country are hurting really bad and for that reason all
Developing countries that are sending out huge amounts of money in debt repayments. They should be given a two to three year
Interest free debt holiday so that money is not flowing out
So that actually helps them to meet health education sanitation and so on debt repayments to
Us get to governments or to the IMF or to a combination of those
So you're saying all the countries who have been given loans because they needed money
Just like we're trying to fix things for the homeowners. We should try and renegotiate that stuff also
yeah, and you know give them a a
Period of two years hopefully by which the crisis would be beyond us so that people can actually
Countries can have a chance to actually survive and make sure that the human costs are not too catastrophic
The second thing we're saying is use this opportunity
To connect the different crisis that the global community faces. Don't treat the financial crisis as a
Crisis in a box, but look at how we can connect the financial crisis with the climate
crisis with the food and fuel price crisis all linked up and the third demand is obviously that
What we've learned over the last two months is we ourselves thought you know when we asked for you know
Cancel third world debt. It was a lot of money because to cancel all of third world debt is five hundred billion dollars
And suddenly we find that that's actually small change
In the current context and what it shows is that the way there is political
We will to address a problem and to find the resources money can be found and we hope that the fact that we've got
Daily passive genocide or a daily silent tsunami going on in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world
That that generosity will be forthcoming by the richest nations on the planet
So you are worried that your concerns will be left out from the meeting here this weekend
But there are a lot of people who say there's no danger of that because don't worry
Absolutely, nothing will happen this weekend
well
this is a sad situation because the transition in the United States in terms of the presidential transition means that this meeting which
Is going to be an expensive meeting will have 20 of the most powerful heads of state around the table
This is a cost to the planet of this meeting and it should be able to deliver
Substantively, what do you think the odds are that?
We'll know the answer at the end of this weekend
Do you think the sorts of things you're talking about will be part of some framework coming out of this meeting really?
That is our hope. I think that
Hope
If
Careful our predictions again will know in a few days
Yeah, I think if we go by precedent if we go by the expectations we have of g8 meetings
WTO meetings and so on then I would say that
Minus five percent would be what we would be looking at
However, this meeting is happening at a particular moment in world history. It is not any other moment
It's a moment that calls for courage vision and a sense of urgency and
We hope that even if that urgency is not coming from the rich countries
That some of the developing countries around the table who themselves like Argentina
We're in a crisis and know what it means for a country to be economically on its knees
Will actually act with the kind of urgency that the world's people both in rich and poor countries
Expect from these leaders that are gathering. Thanks to Kumi Naidu the co-chair of the global call to action against poverty
He's from South Africa and we'll have more on the g20 next week. Well, I think that does it for us here today on planet
Money, I'm David Kestenbaum and I'm Dan Costello. Thanks for listening
Because we are free
