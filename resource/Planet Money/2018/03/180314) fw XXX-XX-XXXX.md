How did the social security number become the most important identifier in the United States? And is that even a good idea?

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

You are never supposed to do this. And we would normally never do this. But we're going to start this episode by reading someone's Social Security number.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

This is the most infamous Social Security number in the world.

SMITH: Yeah, and weirdly, the most popular Social Security number.

MALONE: OK, here we go.

SMITH: OK.

MALONE: Our apologies in advance to Hilda Schrader Whitcher of Lockport, N.Y....

SMITH: Do it.

MALONE: ...Because her number is 078-05-1120.

SMITH: Oh, God, it feels terrible.

MALONE: It feels bad. It felt like we said Voldemort, like, out loud.

SMITH: In this day and age, your Social Security number is this unique part of you that you are supposed to guard with your life.

MALONE: Because it is your life. Somebody can use it to help steal your identity, charge a bunch of Xboxes to credit cards in your name, to steal your tax refund.

SMITH: But that is not the story of how we got Hilda Whitcher's number.

MALONE: No, this story, as you may guess from the name Hilda, happened a while ago in the 1930s.

CAROLYN PUCKETT: There was a manufacturer of wallets that we...

SMITH: No, I'm so sorry to interrupt you, but we should probably introduce you.

PUCKETT: OK.

MALONE: This is Carolyn Puckett, a longtime employee of the Social Security Administration.

SMITH: And how many years did you work there?

PUCKETT: I have worked for Social Security for 37 years.

MALONE: Back in the 1930s, Social Security numbers were these brand-new things. People didn't really understand what they were or how you got one.

SMITH: They were invented as part of the Social Security program. You'd have taxes taken out of your paycheck, and then the Social Security Administration would keep track of all of that money using your brand new Social Security number.

PUCKETT: So in 1938, a wallet manufacturer in Lockport, N.Y., decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into the wallet.

SMITH: But instead of putting some random number on a piece of paper, the head of the company used a very realistic number.

MALONE: He used the number of his secretary, Hilda Schrader Whitcher.

PUCKETT: 078-05-1120.

MALONE: This wallet, containing Hilda's number, was sold at Woolworths to thousands of people who bought the wallet and then got very confused.

PUCKETT: A lot of people, when they got that card, they started using it as their own number.

MALONE: (Laughter).

PUCKETT: And they started working under that number.

SMITH: Why?

PUCKETT: Well, you know, they didn't really understand how you got a card. They didn't understand the numbering system. And so people adopted this as their Social Security number.

SMITH: You know what this reminds me of? It's like buying, like, a picture frame from a store and just going like, hey, I like this beautiful couple that's in the frame.

PUCKETT: Yeah.

SMITH: I'm just going to keep this on my mantelpiece.

PUCKETT: Exactly.

MALONE: Or it's like getting the frame and being like, oh, this must be my family.

PUCKETT: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: I should marry these people.

MALONE: These are cool.

SMITH: It took the Social Security Administration decades to clean up this mess.

PUCKETT: Matter of fact, the peak year that it was used was 1943. And at that time, there were 5,755 people...

SMITH: (Laughter).

PUCKETT: ...Still using that as their own Social Security number. And matter of fact, as late as 1977, there were still 12 people using that Social Security number.

SMITH: Hilda, of course, got a new Social Security number.

MALONE: And in an interview, she was quoted as saying, "I can't understand how people can be so stupid."

(SOUNDBITE OF DARCUS KNIGHT AND LARRY GOMEZ'S "SWAMP CITY")

SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone. And in all seriousness, who was more stupid - people who thought you got a Social Security number issued to you through a wallet at Woolworths or a nation that decided to base your entire personal financial life on a nine-digit number?

SMITH: Today on the show, we're going to answer a question that we've had for a long time. How did this happen? How did we pick this particular system of nine numbers?

MALONE: Hard to remember, easy to steal.

(SOUNDBITE OF DARCUS KNIGHT AND LARRY GOMEZ'S "SWAMP CITY")

SMITH: The Social Security number was invented at a single meeting, a gathering of what we have to assume were the greatest numeric minds of their generation.

MALONE: Now, to be fair, we know almost nothing about this meeting in reality. But we did ask.

SMITH: Did this meeting have a name? Like, was this, like, the big number confab of 1935? Did people fly in from around the country?

PUCKETT: Probably did not fly in from around the country since they were government agencies, and they tended to be headquartered in Washington, D.C.

MALONE: True.

SMITH: That is our friend Carolyn Puckett again - stickler for facts.

MALONE: When Carolyn worked at the Social Security Administration, she wrote the story of how the Social Security number wound up controlling our lives.

PUCKETT: Yes. And, of course, that was never the intention when the Social Security number was invented. Would you like to hear a little bit about the history?

SMITH: We would.

MALONE: I think we would.

PUCKETT: It starts with the signing of the Social Security Act on August the 14, 1935. And...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: This Social Security measure gives at least some protection to 30 millions of our citizens.

SMITH: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1935. And the idea of Social Security was pretty simple - we got your back.

MALONE: All workers would pay into the system, and then when you can no longer work, some money comes back to you or to your family.

SMITH: Now all they had to do was find a way to track every single worker in the United States.

PUCKETT: There were already some Social Security-type systems in Europe, so the first thing they did was to contact the experts in Europe to see what they suggested. And they pretty much suggested that it just couldn't be done.

SMITH: Europe was like, that is a terrible idea. You can't track every single person every single year for the rest of their lives. It's 1935. We don't have iPhones yet.

MALONE: And America was like, yeah, OK, Europe, you know what? Hold my drink.

SMITH: Oyez, oyez, oyez.

(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL)

SMITH: All right, everybody sit down. Everybody sit down. We bring to order the big number confab of 1935.

MALONE: The following is a recreation. But the story is based on real ideas that were on the table.

SMITH: Let me get into character.

All right, everybody. Europe says it cannot be done. But let's show them how we do things in the United States of America.

MALONE: And, of course, everyone is like, yeah.

SMITH: OK. So how do we tell everyone apart? Super easy - let's just use everybody's names. Everybody's got a name.

MALONE: Technically, that was true.

SMITH: What was wrong with your name?

PUCKETT: Well, as you know, Robert Smith, there are probably a whole lot of Robert Smiths. As a matter of fact, back in the 1930s, there was an association of Fred Smiths (ph) in New York City because there were so many of them, they were getting each other's mail. And they set up a little association so they could exchange mail and get everybody straight.

(SOUNDBITE OF PEN SCRATCHING ON PAPER)

SMITH: All right, let me cross that out. We have a suggestion from the floor - fingerprints.

MALONE: And everybody's like, yeah, fingerprints. Those are unique. Everybody's got those.

PUCKETT: But, of course, that was connected, in everybody's mind, with criminals.

MALONE: Ah, right. Every American worker getting hauled into a government building for fingerprinting would look bad.

SMITH: OK, fine, fine, fine. No bad ideas. Numbers. Numbers - like, a human license plate. We'll just do numbers, like, nine of them. We'll throw some dashes in there - like, three and then two numbers and a dash, then four numbers. Who could possibly object to that? They're just numbers.

MALONE: And, of course, you know that somebody in the back of the room, at this point, stands up. And they're like, (coughing), a reading from the Book of Revelation 3:18. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. And his number is 600 threescore and six.

PUCKETT: Six, six, six.

MALONE: That was not going to work, not for the first three numbers, at least.

PUCKETT: Social Security has never and never plans to use 666.

MALONE: So the Social Security Administration didn't want to be accused of handing out the mark of the beast.

PUCKETT: Right.

MALONE: ...And in fact, being a sign of the end times.

PUCKETT: (Laughter) Right. Exactly.

SMITH: All right, let's wrap up this confab. We all agree - nine numbers, no mark of the beast. First three numbers will be, like, a geographic code, which we will later stop doing. But let's just do it for now.

(SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL)

SMITH: Meeting adjourned.

MALONE: And that is a very dramatic version of how we ended up with a Social Security number. The next hurdle was handing those numbers out.

SMITH: Sure. They had to figure out what number would go to which person and then how people would remember what their number was. And at first, there was the suggestion to give everyone their number on little metal dog tags like they have in the military, which would've taken literal tons of metal. So they went with a little thick paper card they were going to send out to people.

MALONE: And remember, this isn't a huge deal. You just needed this number to track your earnings, and that's basically it.

SMITH: Like any good numerical system, you start with No. 1, or in this case, 001-01-0001.

MALONE: At first, they wanted to give this lowest number away as, like, an honor. They offered it to a guy who had played a huge role in helping Social Security get set up.

SMITH: But he was like, no, thank you. Some other bigwig turned it down as well, and so it landed on the pile and was handed out like any other old number.

PUCKETT: That 001-01-0001 went to a Grace Owens in New Hampshire.

SMITH: Do we know what her job was she needed the Social Security number for?

PUCKETT: I don't really know anything about her other than she got the lowest number.

MALONE: Sounds like a job for two intrepid reporters.

SMITH: We'll find it.

PUCKETT: OK.

SMITH: We started to look into this. Who was this Grace Owen who got this super special, really easy-to-remember Social Security number?

MALONE: She died decades ago. But...

VIVIAN CLARK: Hello.

MALONE: Hi, is this Vivian?

CLARK: Yes.

MALONE: We were able to track down Vivian Clark.

CLARK: I only knew Grace after I married her nephew in 1961 and...

MALONE: Vivian is - I guess you'd call her a niece-in-law of Grace Owen - didn't remember much about Grace.

CLARK: She smoked like a chimney.

MALONE: (Laughter).

SMITH: Vivian said there is another cousin who could know more.

PAM PERDUE: Hello?

MALONE: Hi, is this Pam?

PERDUE: It is.

MALONE: Pam Perdue?

PERDUE: Pam Owen Perdue, and I am the niece of Grace Dorothy Owen.

MALONE: Pam says her Aunt Grace never had kids. She worked as a secretary. She was married once, got divorced, remarried and became Grace Owen Muzzey. And Pam remembers that even from a young age, this lowest number was a big deal. She remembers her dad telling her about it.

PERDUE: And I also remember my dad telling me that she went on the show "I've Got A Secret."

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: "I've Got A Secret," presented by Winston, America's best-tasting filter cigarette...

MALONE: "I've Got A Secret" was this show where a panel of celebrities tries to figure out why you're sort of famous. And this is actually the only tape we could find of Grace Owen Muzzey's voice.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

GARRY MOORE: Will you tell our panel please what's your name is and where you're from?

GRACE MUZZEY: My name is Mrs. Grace Muzzey from Concord, N.H.

MOORE: Now, Mrs. Muzzey has a secret which she will whisper to me, and we'll show it to you at home.

MALONE: And that is pretty much all she says. She thoroughly stumps the panel.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Oh, the first Social Security card.

MOORE: She is the possessor of the very first Social Security number.

(APPLAUSE)

MALONE: Technically, the lowest number. It's complicated. Don't worry about it.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: And the number is 001-01-001.

SMITH: At this moment, they are holding up a giant copy of her Social Security number for a national television audience like it was no big deal, which it wasn't yet.

MALONE: Right. If someone was watching this on live television, sure, they could, like, steal Grace's Social Security number. But probably the worst thing that they could do is use that at their job, and then their Social Security taxes would go into Grace's account.

SMITH: Which, I guess, in that case, would mean that Grace would make more money from Social Security.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: Thank you very much, Mrs. Muzzey. You have really stumped the panel. Here's your $80, a carton of Winstons and our thanks for being with us tonight.

(APPLAUSE)

SMITH: She must've loved those Winstons.

MALONE: She does look very happy in the tape, I will say.

SMITH: Now, I know this just seems like the answer to some trivia question - the woman with the lowest Social Security number. But what I saw in this tape was a foreshadowing of something that was about to happen, that you don't just get a number and file it away. In some weird way, you are your Social Security number. Grace was considered by the world an interesting person because she had an interesting number.

MALONE: And so we know that eventually, this number would take over our lives. But how exactly did that happen, and when did it happen?

SMITH: Yeah. Who - I mean, who's responsible for that?

PUCKETT: Well, the federal government, to some extent.

SMITH: Carolyn Puckett.

PUCKETT: As early as 1943, there was a presidential executive order.

MALONE: A presidential executive order that said, look, if you're a federal agency and you need a new record system, stop. Do not invent a whole new one. Take a look at that thing they've got going on over at Social Security.

SMITH: Pretty sweet.

MALONE: Why don't you just use that?

SMITH: So wait, when did the IRS start using it for taxes?

PUCKETT: 1962.

SMITH: Around the same year, the Social Security number becomes the ID number for federal employees.

MALONE: Medicare starts using it for enrollment in 1965.

PUCKETT: Veterans Administration started using it in 1966.

MALONE: OK. How about the Department of Defense?

PUCKETT: Department of Defense started using it in 1969 as the military identification number.

SMITH: Food stamps, 1977.

MALONE: Federal loans, 1982.

SMITH: HUD programs, 1988.

MALONE: And just one after another.

SMITH: Driver's licenses, federal workers' compensation, marriage licenses.

MALONE: The Social Security number becomes so broadly used that by default, it becomes our national identification.

SMITH: Carolyn, at any point, did the people who worked for the Social Security Administration, the people who went through all this trouble to invent this number for a legitimate, small-focused reason, didn't they tell everyone to just knock it off. Like, you're going to ruin this number.

PUCKETT: Well, the Social Security Administration did not have the legal authority to restrict the use of the Social Security number. They still don't. So there was no way Social Security could stop people from using it for what they wanted to.

MALONE: As all of these agencies and businesses started using the number, what was the tipping point where it went from an innocuous number that really didn't mean a ton to something that contained your entire identity, potentially?

PUCKETT: I suspect when one's credit history was tied in with a Social Security number.

SMITH: Your credit history, which is basically a history of how often you have paid your bills on time, whether you are a worthwhile risk for someone to extend credit or to lend you money. For decades, credit reporting agencies have been gathering all this information, all this dirt on you. But all of a sudden with a Social Security number, they could tie it altogether and bring in so much more information about your life that one mistake could follow you for decades.

MALONE: And so your Social Security number wasn't just tied to government benefits or contributions. It was tied to credit cards, to loans, to the mistakes you made. And that's fine as long as, you know, there isn't some conglomerate with hundreds, thousands, millions of these that could get hacked one day.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Welcome to the Equifax automated security freeze system.

MALONE: The Equifax hack. We did a whole episode about the history of credit bureaus and the Equifax hack. And if you didn't get a chance to hear it, check it out, and you will hear just how bad things can get.

SMITH: Now, to be fair, I have personally noticed over the last decade or so that there are fewer people putting my Social Security number on random forms or on my medical insurance card. People seem to be a little bit more respectful of the digits.

MALONE: Yeah. In fact, states and the federal government have tried to scale back the use, but the damage is done.

SMITH: You know, we kept asking Carolyn, if you could go back in time and redesign the system, is there a better way to do it? And she said, no. No. The Social Security number is designed fine for what it was supposed to do.

MALONE: But the problem, clearly, was that the United States sort of needed some kind of national identification but didn't want to do it, not with the picture and the fingerprint and all of the things you would actually need to do it correctly.

SMITH: And so in fine American tradition, we half-assed it. The task fell to the closest thing that we had - nine digits to carry the bureaucratic dreams of an entire nation.

MALONE: And rather than getting upset with the Social Security number, Carolyn almost seems, like, sort of, like, wistful about it.

PUCKETT: And we do now issue Social Security numbers to children when they're born. It actually does track you from your first day on the planet to your death.

(SOUNDBITE OF CRAIG DAVID JOINER'S "BLUE REFLECTIONS")

SMITH: They say that everyone dies alone. And when I'm on my deathbed, I don't know if my kids will be there or if my wife will still be around. But I do feel heartened knowing that I'm going to be laying there with my old companion, [bleep].

MALONE: Robert.

SMITH: [Bleep].

MALONE: Wait, no - is that - is this your real number?

SMITH: It is my real number.

MALONE: We can't - we're going to have to bleep that.

SMITH: We'll bleep it.

(SOUNDBITE OF CRAIG DAVID JOINER'S "BLUE REFLECTIONS")

MALONE: When we come back, "I've Got A Secret."

SMITH: Brought to you by Winston.

(SOUNDBITE OF CRAIG DAVID JOINER'S "BLUE REFLECTIONS")

SMITH: Our dramatic recreation of the invention of the Social Security number was loosely inspired by the comedian Gary Gulman.

MALONE: A special thanks this week to Janice Brown of the Cow Hampshire blog.

SMITH: Love it.

MALONE: ...And to listener Erik Rigler for sending us an email with the wallet story. We are planetmoney@npr.org.

SMITH: This week's episode was manufactured by Sally Helm, Lena Richards, Alex Goldmark and Bryant Urstadt.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone.

SMITH: I'm Robert Smith. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF LEIGH MCALLISTER GRACIE'S "WE GAVE UP TOO SOON")

SMITH: You know, our intern, Aviva DeKornfeld, managed to track down that incredible audio from "I've Got A Secret." I never thought I would hear the voice of Grace Muzzey, but we did. But there were some negotiations about how much of that audio we could use in the story.

MALONE: In fact, they required us to license a minimum of one minute. What you heard in the story was just about, like, 35 seconds worth.

SMITH: But we had to pay for an entire minute, so let's get our money's worth.

MALONE: So ladies and gentlemen, come back in time with us to the year 1957.

SMITH: You've settled down on the chesterfield with a mug of Ovaltine and a pack of Winstons.

MALONE: You click on the old telly.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: And this is a very tough one, I'll tell you, so I'll give you give you an additional clue. It's, something that she has is the first of its kind.

MALONE: And this "I've Got A Secret" panel, they just cannot crack Mrs. Grace Muzzey from Concord, N.H.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Is it in the animal - is it animate?

SMITH: Keep playing. Keep playing.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: No.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Was it ever live?

MUZZEY: No.

MOORE: No.

MALONE: Love it.

SMITH: More. More.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Mrs. Muzzey, this thing was thought up - was it thought up by you?

MUZZEY: Oh, no.

SMITH: Oh, we're running out of time. Come on.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Is this a work of art?

MUZZEY: No.

SMITH: Three seconds left.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Is it a mental thing more than a tangible object?

SMITH: Two seconds left.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: Well, let me say this...

SMITH: One second.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "I'VE GOT A SECRET")

MOORE: This is a difficult question to answer. It has...

SMITH: Cut it. Cut it. Cut it.

MALONE: No more.

All right, everybody sit down everybody sit down
We bring to order the big number confab of
1935 the following is a recreation, but the story is based on real ideas that were on the table. Let me get the character
Alright, everybody Europe says it cannot be done
But let's show them how we do things in the United States of America. And of course everyone is like, yeah
Okay. So how do we tell everyone apart?
Super easy. Let's just use everybody's names. Everybody's got a name
Technically that was true. What was wrong with your name?
Well, as you know, Robert Smith, they're probably a whole lot of Robert Smith's matter of fact back in the

Connected in everybody's mind with criminals. Ah
Right. Every American worker getting hauled into a government building for fingerprinting would look bad
Okay, fine. Fine. Fine. No bad ideas
Numbers numbers like a human license plate. We'll just do numbers like nine of them
We'll throw some dashes in there like three and then two numbers and a dash the four numbers
Who could possibly object to that? They're just numbers
and of course, you know that somebody in the back of the room at this point stands up and they're like a
reading from the book of Revelation
chapter 13 verse 18
Here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and
His number is six hundred three score and six six six six
That was not gonna work not for the first three numbers at least
Social Security has never and never plans to use six six six
So so the Social Security Administration didn't want to be accused of handing out the mark of the beast
Right and in fact being a sign of the end times. Yeah, right exactly
Alright, let's wrap up this confab. We all agree nine numbers
No mark the beast first three numbers will be like a geographic code
Which we will later stop doing but let's just do it for now
Meeting adjourned and that is a very dramatic version of how we ended up with a social security number
The next hurdle was handing those numbers out
Sure
They had to figure out what number would go to which person and then how people would remember what their number was
And at first there was this suggestion to give everyone their number on little metal dog tags like they have in the military
Which would have taken literal tons of metal so they went with a little thick paper card
They were gonna send out to people and remember this isn't a huge deal
You just needed this number to track your earnings and and that's basically it like any good
Numerical system you start with number one or in this case zero zero one zero one zero zero zero one
At first they wanted to give this lowest number away as like an honor
They offered it to a guy who played a huge role in helping Social Security get set up
But he was like, no, thank you
some other big wig turned it down as well and so it landed on the pile and was
Handed out like any other old number that zero zero one zero one zero zero zero one
Went to a grace Owens in New Hampshire. Do we know what her job was?
She needed the Social Security number for I don't really know anything about her other than she got the lowest number
Sounds like the job for two intrepid reporters. We'll find it. Okay
We started to look into this who was this grace Owen who got this super special really easy to remember Social Security number
She died decades ago, but oh hi, is this Vivian? Yeah, we were able to track down Vivian Clark
I only knew grace after I married her nephew in
1961 and Vivian is I guess you'd call her a niece-in-law of grace Owen didn't remember much about grace
She smoked like a chimney
Vivian said there is another cousin who could know more. Hello. Hi, is this Pam?
It is Pam Purdue Pam Owen Purdue and I am the niece of grace
Dorothy Owen Pam says her aunt grace never had kids. She worked as a secretary
She was married once got divorced remarried and became grace
Owen muzzy and Pam remembers that even from a young age this lowest number was a big deal
She remembers her dad telling her about it
I also remember my dad telling me that she went on the show. I've got a secret
Presented by Winston America's best-tasting filter cigarette
I've got a secret was this show where a panel of celebrities tries to figure out why you're sort of famous
And this is actually the only tape we could find of grace Owen muzzy's voice
Will you tell our panel please what your name is and where you're from?
My name is this is grace muzzy
Mrs. Muzzy has a secret which she will whisper to me and we'll show it to you at home
And that is pretty much all she says she thoroughly stumps the panel
Technically the lowest number it's complicated. Don't worry about it. And the number is oh
At this moment they are holding up a giant
Copy of her social security number for a national television audience like it was no big deal
Which it wasn't yet if someone was watching this on live television sure they could like steal grace's social security number
But probably the worst thing that they could do is use that at their job
And then their social security taxes would go into grace's account
Which I guess in that case would mean that grace would make more money from social security
Thank you very much mrs. Muzzy you have really stumped the panel here's your $80 a carton of winstons and our thanks for being with you
With us tonight. She must have loved those winstons. She does look very happy in the tape
I will say now
I know this just seems like the answer to some trivia question the woman with the lowest social security number
but what I saw in this tape was a
Foreshadowing of something that was about to happen that you don't just get a number and file it away in some weird way
You are your social security number
Grace was considered by the world an interesting person because she had an interesting number
And so we know that eventually this number would take over our lives
But how exactly did that happen and when did it happen? Yeah, who I mean who's responsible for that?
Well the federal government to some extent Carolyn Puckett as early as
1943 there was a
presidential executive order a presidential executive order that said look if
You're a federal agency and you need a new record system stop do not invent a whole new one
Take a look at that thing. They've got going on over at Social Security pretty sweet. Why don't you just use that?
So wait, when did the IRS start using it for taxes?
1962 around the same year the Social Security number becomes the ID number for federal employees Medicare starts using it for enrollment in
1965 veterans administration started using it in
1966 okay, how about the Department of Defense Department of Defense started using it in
1969 as the as the military identification number food stamps 1977 federal loans 1982 HUD programs
1988 and just one after another drivers licenses federal workers compensation marriage licenses
The Social Security number becomes so broadly used that by default it becomes our national identification
Kellen at any point did the people who worked for the Social Security
administration the people who went through all this trouble to invent this number for a
Legitimate small focused reason didn't they tell everyone to just knock it off like you're gonna ruin this number
Well, the Social Security administration do not have the legal authority to restrict the use of the Social Security number
They still don't
So there was no way Social Security could stop people from using it for what they wanted to as all of these agencies and
Businesses started using the number
What was the tipping point where it went from an innocuous number that really didn't mean a ton to something that?
Contained your entire identity potentially I
Suspect when one's credit history was tied in with a Social Security number your credit history
We're just basically a history of how often you have paid your bills on time whether you are a worthwhile risk for someone
To extend credit or to lend you money for decades credit reporting agencies have been gathering all this information all this dirt on you
But all of a sudden with a Social Security number
They could tie it all together and bring in so much more information about your life
That one mistake could follow you for decades and so your Social Security number wasn't just tied to government benefits or
Contributions it was tied to credit cards to loans to the mistakes you made and that's fine as long as you know
there isn't some conglomerate with
Hundreds thousands millions of these that could get hacked one day
Welcome to the Equifax automated security freeze system the Equifax hack
We did a whole episode about the history of credit bureaus and the Equifax hack
And if you didn't get a chance to hear it check it out
And you will hear just how bad things can get now to be fair
I have personally noticed over the last decade or so that there are fewer people putting my Social Security number on
Random forms or on my medical insurance card people seem to be a little bit more respectful of the digits
Yeah, in fact states and the federal government have tried to scale back the use but the damage is done
you know we kept asking Carolyn if you could go back in time and
Redesign this system is there a better way to do it and she said no
No, the Social Security number is designed fine for what it was supposed to do
But the problem clearly was that the United States sort of needed some kind of national identification
But didn't want to do it
Not with the picture and the fingerprint and all of the things you would actually need to do it correctly
And so in fine American tradition we half-assed it the task felt the closest thing that we had
Nine digits to carry the bureaucratic dreams of an entire nation and rather than getting upset with the Social Security number
Carolyn almost seems like sort of like wistful about it, and we do now issue Social Security numbers to children when they're born
It actually does track you from your first day on the planet to your death
They say that everyone dies alone and when I'm on my deathbed
I don't know if my kids will be there or if my wife will still be around
But I do feel heart and knowing that I'm gonna be laying there with my old companion
Robert
Wait no is that is this your real number? It is my real number. We can't we're gonna have to bleep that
When we come back I've got a secret brought to you by Winston
