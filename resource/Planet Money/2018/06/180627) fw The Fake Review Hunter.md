Fake product reviews are wrecking the internet. But help is on the way: From a bodybuilding fake review hunter.

Tommy Noonan is a bit of a gym rat. Back when he was in college, one of his weightlifting friends complained about an energy powder he bought online. The product made him sick, and Tommy saw an opportunity. He built a website where bodybuilders could review the stuff they were putting into their bodies.

#850: The Fake Review Hunter

But as the website became more prominent, Tommy realized there was a big problem: Weirdly positive reviews. Tommy suspected they were being written by supplement companies themselves.

Today on the show: a quest to identify fake online reviews. It starts with a small bodybuilding website, and ends with the elephant of online shopping: Amazon.com.

Music: "Spinning Piano" and "Club Soda".

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

HILKE SCHELLMANN, HOST:

And I'm Hilke Schellmann.

MALONE: Hilke Schellmann - journalism professor at NYU, documentary filmmaker. And we've asked you here to join us today because I feel like it's fair to say you've become mildly obsessed with the topic of today's show.

SCHELLMANN: There might be some truth to that. Look, I'm a journalism professor. I think a lot about - I worry a lot about fake news. And more generally, I'm really concerned about trust on the Internet.

MALONE: And Hilke came to us and said, before there was fake news, before there was the possibility of, like, fake video and fake audio, the world was dealing with a different fake problem.

SCHELLMANN: Yes. Fake online reviews. People have been posting dishonest online fake reviews for years.

MALONE: Yeah. And this is becoming such a huge problem because, like, you know, I go online to buy a hoverboard, and I don't know if this hoverboard has five stars because it is awesome, and I'm going to cruise around town looking cool, or if it has five stars because someone is making up those reviews and, in fact, when I take it home, it's going to set my house on fire.

But Hilke is here with a glimmer of hope for us.

SCHELLMANN: Yes. And the glimmer of hope is coming from a totally unexpected place - the online bodybuilding community.

MALONE: Today on the show, the story of one weightlifter battling fake reviews on his own website and what happened when he took on Amazon.com.

A couple of things to know about Tommy Noonan. He lives in Reno, Nev. He likes to juggle weird things.

TOMMY NOONAN: So just, you know, I'll be, like, in the grocery store, and I'll have, like, an avocado and a onion and a bottle of water.

MALONE: Whoa, that's high stakes. You drop an avocado, you're buying that thing.

NOONAN: Yeah.

MALONE: Yeah.

SCHELLMANN: The story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around 2006.

MALONE: Tommy was in college at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo at the time. He was 19, and he was a bit of a gym rat. At his peak, he could bench press around 240 pounds.

SCHELLMANN: One day, Tommy was hanging out with a friend.

NOONAN: And he says, hey, do you want the rest of this pre-workout?

MALONE: Pre-workout - that's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym.

NOONAN: And it just gives you crazy energy, and you can lift more and longer and harder. You know, at least those are the claims.

MALONE: Just to be clear, this is not a steroid, in case that's what you're thinking. Tommy is very against using those.

SCHELLMANN: Anyway, Tommy's friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased. And he says to Tommy...

NOONAN: I paid 60 bucks for it, and it gives me such bad stomach issues, it's ruining my workouts. It's, you know, counterproductive.

MALONE: If you're not familiar with the supplement world, it's not the most tightly regulated world. And on top of that, back in 2006, more and more folks were starting to buy things online, like supplements.

NOONAN: The gears in my head started turning, and I started looking up supplement reviews, and I couldn't find anything that was legit. I mean, it was all just written by the manufacturer. They could just...

SCHELLMANN: Tommy saw an opportunity. He could build an online review site where bodybuilders give honest feedback about these supplements they're putting into their bodies.

MALONE: And so Tommy got to work. He taught himself some computer coding, and he created what he would eventually call SupplementReviews.com. Before long, super-chiseled dudes were logging on to leave their super-honest reviews.

And, look, I know not all bodybuilders sound this way, but as I read through these reviews, I could not not hear them in the voice of The Situation from "Jersey Shore."

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: (Imitating New Jersey accent) Just started using this product. Got way huge. Can't complain. Overall rating - 8.

MALONE: Yeah, you know, we couldn't get the real Situation. But filling in is our very own Stacey Vanek Smith.

VANEK SMITH: Very swoll Stacey Vanek Smith.

MALONE: (Laughter) Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: No one knows this. You can't tell from my voice, but I'm - you know, I'm huge.

MALONE: Stacey, how much can you bench press, would you say?

VANEK SMITH: Three-hundred pounds seems plausible. Like, I could probably bench press you, Kenny.

MALONE: Yeah, OK. Anyway, Tommy's site became a place where bodybuilders could share all kinds of supplement experiences, including great successes.

VANEK SMITH: This literally gives me skin-splitting pumps - no lie. I have stretch marks all over, and incredible gains. Overall rating - 10.

SCHELLMANN: Maybe more importantly, the site was also a place where bodybuilders could tell each other about problematic products.

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent) I am sure that this will be the last day I take this [expletive]. I have heart palpitations, and I'm not sure if tomorrow I will wake up. Overall rating - 5.

MALONE: Overall rating - 5?

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent) I don't know. I mean, it tasted pretty good.

MALONE: (Laughter) OK. Well, not everyone thought that same powder tasted good.

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent) This stuff gave me a strong urge to vomit - some sort of strange circus going on in my stomach. Overall rating - 1.

MALONE: Yeah. There's a lot of talk of stomach issues.

SCHELLMANN: Yeah. And bloating.

MALONE: Is bloating a big problem?

NOONAN: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

MALONE: Bodybuilders were writing reviews, and Tommy got a referral fee when customers found products they liked through his site.

SCHELLMANN: It was going so well for Tommy that he decided to just run the site full-time.

NOONAN: Then, as it grew, it started climbing the ranks in Google. You know, ranking number one for the term supplement reviews.

MALONE: It must've been a big day the day that happened.

NOONAN: Yeah, it was.

MALONE: But as the website became more and more prominent, supplement companies became more and more aware of Tommy's site and how their products were being reviewed on his site.

SCHELLMANN: Tommy says at the time, he was maybe getting, like, 20 reviews a day. Look, he wasn't reading every single one of them, but he was reading a lot of them. And he started to see these suspiciously positive reviews creeping in.

MALONE: This is one, for example.

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent) University-proven studies - anyone can test a product, but to have proof that it works is key. I absolutely enjoy the taste, especially the grape. I also really enjoyed the unflavored and the tropical flavored...

NOONAN: And it almost reads like a sales pitch. And you kind of read it, and you think, all right. Was it a rep that wrote this, or was it someone that just drank the Kool-Aid of the marketing campaign?

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent) I never get bloated from it, despite I sometimes take 2 times as much as the serving during and after my workout. Believe the hype, as this product truly delivers upon what it promises. The taste of it is very good as well, if mixed properly.

MALONE: So for Tommy, these kinds of reviews were sometimes hard to deal with because it sounded like a person from the company had just come in and written this. But what if it was someone who had tried the product and really did believe the hype?

SCHELLMANN: And that's the problem with online reviews in a nutshell. It's almost impossible to tell from the content alone if the review's fake or not.

MALONE: But Tommy knew if a company was coming in and pretending to be a regular bodybuilder who happened to love their product, the entire idea of his website would fall apart.

NOONAN: So I would really have to do a bunch of investigative work on each one to really see where it originated and whether it was from the company or not.

SCHELLMANN: So Tommy goes to work.

NOONAN: Basically, the first thing I check out is the email address that they used to register for the site.

MALONE: Did - were they dumb enough to use the company email address?

NOONAN: That happens sometimes (laughter).

SCHELLMANN: No.

NOONAN: Yes.

SCHELLMANN: It didn't take Tommy long to realize that these companies were coming in. And basically, they were just writing press releases.

MALONE: And it kept happening. These fake reviews were flooding in and starting to overwhelm the real reviews.

NOONAN: And I just thought, it's not fair that, you know, people that actually leave feedback that is, you know, real and honest are getting silenced.

SCHELLMANN: Tommy took all this time and created this place for honest feedback. And now, it was just being turned into the exact opposite.

NOONAN: Yeah, yeah. Well, it's my - you know, it was my work. It was my life's work. And it's just - it's painful to see somebody just disrespect it like that in the name of money.

MALONE: Tommy's site was a pretty small site in the grand scheme of things. But he started to wonder, like, if this is happening to SupplementReviews.com, I wonder how big of a problem this is at other sites.

SCHELLMANN: So he went into the belly of the beast of online shopping, Amazon.com.

NOONAN: And I looked at this testosterone booster that had 560 reviews.

MALONE: It was actually 580 reviews. Tommy starts to scan through a little bit, and his fake review Spidey senses are going bonkers.

SCHELLMANN: And he's like, OK, I'm going to inspect every single one of these reviews.

MALONE: It's going to be a lot of work, and I'm going to need my special Pandora station for this.

NOONAN: Based off of a song from - I call them deadmau5, but other people call them Dead Mouse (ph).

MALONE: Sure.

NOONAN: It's called - "Take Care Of The Proper Paperwork" is the name of the song.

(SOUNDBITE OF DEADMAU5'S "TAKE CARE OF THE PROPER PAPERWORK")

MALONE: This certainly must be in the Top 10 songs named after paperwork, don't you think?

SCHELLMANN: Yes. There's a mind-numbing sound of bureaucracy.

NOONAN: That is pretty accurate.

MALONE: So Tommy is going through every single review and essentially asking himself, how do I know I can trust this?

NOONAN: I've got an Excel spreadsheet open, and I got Amazon, and I've got, like, 500 tabs open on Amazon. And I'm sitting there, just look at the next review, tally, update it. Look at the next review, tally, update it.

MALONE: And as he does this, he starts to learn the tricks of online fake reviewers. Some of them are not so tricky. For example, one review, he noticed there was a before and an after picture. Before - super skinny guy, after - super ripped.

SCHELLMANN: Tommy does a reverse image search, and he finds the earliest example of the photo on Reddit.

NOONAN: And I message that user on Reddit, and I said, hey, did you also use this image for a review? And they said, no.

MALONE: Oh.

NOONAN: So...

SCHELLMANN: Busted.

NOONAN: Yeah.

SCHELLMANN: A stolen before-and-after picture - obviously fake.

MALONE: As he investigates, Tommy's also starting to notice that some suspicious reviewers have almost like an M.O. that he can identify. And he starts naming these different types of questionable reviewers.

SCHELLMANN: One category are the brand monogamists. So these are people that only review products from one company over and over again.

MALONE: Sure. Maybe that person really likes that company or maybe that person works for that company. Another fake reviewer profile - the one-hit wonders. These are people who review one thing and then never review anything again.

NOONAN: I mean, obviously, there are people that just review one thing. That's totally a normal thing that happens. But if it happens a lot and if those one-hit wonders are giving the product a five-star across the board, then, you know, again, maybe there is something unnatural about that.

MALONE: Yeah, like if this testosterone booster had a bunch of one-hit wonders that were all really positive, that is pretty unnatural. But the most unnatural pattern Tommy found was this suspicious flood of positive reviews around the exact same time.

NOONAN: You know, it was, like, three days of, you know, this super high volume where I think, like, 30 percent of the reviews were submitted.

MALONE: And that's fishy because it is way more reviews than any other three-a-day stretch, and they're really positive reviews. So it looks like maybe, Tommy says, somebody paid for a bunch of fake reviews around that time.

SCHELLMANN: The way this sometimes works is that a seller might want to boost their rankings. They want to sell more product, and they need more positive reviews. So there are sites where they can buy these fake reviews, but then those positive reviews all post around the same time.

MALONE: And so for Tommy, after reading through all those reviews, learning the tricks of the fake review trade, what percentage of those 580 reviews did he think were tainted or biased in some way?

NOONAN: Probably all of them (laughter).

MALONE: Like nearly 100 percent or maybe 100 percent.

NOONAN: Yeah, or something is wrong with them.

SCHELLMANN: So Tommy was on this mission to clean up the fake reviews on his own website. And then he looked at Amazon, and he finds out even Amazon has this gigantic problem of B.S. reviews.

MALONE: Not only that - if he ever wants to go on Amazon and buy something again, he's realizing he's going to have to spend hours going review by review to figure out what is even trustworthy. Or...

NOONAN: I could write a computer program to do all this in seconds - access these pages automatically, pull the data and give me, you know, a much better picture of the reviews. And I'm sitting there thinking, like, if I wrote that computer program to do all this in seconds, I could point it at any product.

MALONE: And so Tommy Noonan went back to work and, in essence, he coded a version of himself, an Internet review detective that can help any of us pull up an item on Amazon and cut through all the B.S. reviews to find just the good ones. He started a new website that he called reviewmeta.com.

SCHELLMANN: And after the break, we'll go shopping with it.

MALONE: All right, Hilke, show me how ReviewMeta can help me get over my fake review anxiety.

SCHELLMANN: Kenny, what do you need?

MALONE: I just was on vacation, and my phone died four times because I do not - I actually do not have any iPhone cables anymore.

SCHELLMANN: Got it. So you go to Amazon, and you put in iPhone cables. Yeah, so we have over 20,000 results for iPhone cables. That's a lot.

MALONE: Yes. This is where the anxiety starts.

SCHELLMANN: So we're going to click on the one that we like.

MALONE: All right. So this one has 177 reviews, four stars. Like, that looks great on the surface.

SCHELLMANN: And then you take the URL, copy it, and then you paste it into ReviewMeta.

MALONE: OK.

SCHELLMANN: And then I hit run report, and it runs a report.

MALONE: All right. And it says...

SCHELLMANN: Hit go.

MALONE: Computing, computing, bleep, bloop, bleep, bloop - whatever. It's going to take a while. It's reading, like, 177 reviews. It would take me, like, five hours. At any rate, eventually, it spits out a report, and we got Tommy Noonan on the line to walk us through a few of the things his website flagged about these iPhone cable reviews.

NOONAN: OK. So for this product, we see that over the course of five days, this product got 78 percent of their reviews. And on top of that, the reviews from those high-volume days gave the product a 4.9-star rating on average.

SCHELLMANN: These reviews over those five days - pretty suspicious, especially when you look at the reviews from those five days compared to the average reviews. They're way more positive.

MALONE: Tommy says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well. There was one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews.

NOONAN: OK, so the phrase repetition - basically, what we do is we build a gigantic list of all of the phrases that are used in the reviews that are, you know, three words or more. And then we go...

MALONE: The algorithm is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time. For example, it was the. And this way, the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated. For example...

NOONAN: The cord is very tough and doesn't bend like other cords do, but that's probably a good thing. That's not, you know - that - you shouldn't see that in more than one review. But for here, we see it in three reviews.

MALONE: Yeah. And in seven reviews, someone wrote, it's easy to get it back onto the cord and use again. I don't know what it means, but seven people feel that way.

NOONAN: Well, seven people also say they performed their duty with honor and respect. And their is the incorrect version.

(LAUGHTER)

NOONAN: Yeah. So...

SCHELLMANN: Tommy's software ran about a dozen different tests on iPhone cable reviews. And his reports spit out an adjusted rating.

NOONAN: So it went from a 4 star out of 5, with 177 reviews on Amazon. And the adjusted rating on ReviewMeta is 1.7 stars after 10 reviews.

SCHELLMANN: Which is another way of saying Tommy's site only trusted 6 percent of the reviews. And the trustworthy reviews say, actually, these cables are crap.

MALONE: Tommy says, generally speaking, cables like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews.

NOONAN: Anything with, like, low manufacturing costs and high margins.

MALONE: So like what?

NOONAN: Yeah - iPhone cables, backup batteries, screen protectors, phone cases, weight loss pills, testosterone...

SCHELLMANN: We, of course, reached out to Amazon about this.

MALONE: And they declined to go on tape, but they are familiar with Tommy's website. They sent us an extensive statement about it.

VANEK SMITH: (Imitating New Jersey accent, reading) ReviewMeta itself admits that they do not have the data to...

MALONE: No, no, no. Stacey - Stacey, you could do this one as, like, a, you know, non-weightlifter.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, OK. (Reading) ReviewMeta itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even say with high confidence whether a review is fake. According to...

MALONE: What Amazon is saying is not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website. He totally admits that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior, and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as unnatural.

SCHELLMANN: For Amazon, that is a problem.

VANEK SMITH: (Reading) We have hundreds of millions of reviews on Amazon. And of that total, less than 1 percent are inauthentic.

SCHELLMANN: Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake reviewers.

MALONE: In other words, Amazon is saying, there's not a problem, but we're working on it. And this makes me, like, wonder a little bit, how much should I trust that big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this?

SCHELLMANN: So it's complicated - right? - because these e-commerce sites - they make money when they sell more products.

MALONE: Right. Like, it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review. If someone buys a product, that's good for the site.

SCHELLMANN: But there might come a time where there is just too many fake reviews.

MALONE: Sure. Like, there's a tipping point where enough trust is lost that we all just give up...

SCHELLMANN: Yeah.

MALONE: ...On Internet shopping.

SCHELLMANN: Yeah. And we'll go back to France (ph) - to our friends.

MALONE: France?

SCHELLMANN: To our friends. We will go back to our friends...

MALONE: Oh, friends.

SCHELLMANN: ...For recommendations.

MALONE: I was like, you want to go to France? Great.

SCHELLMANN: (Laughter) Well, yes. There is a point where it just ruins it for all of us.

MALONE: And we have to go back to talking to our friends again. Bleh.

SCHELLMANN: Or you have to call your mom.

MALONE: For shopping advice?

SCHELLMANN: Yes. What toothpaste you should use.

MALONE: That is a mom question.

(SOUNDBITE OF CLAUDE PELOUSE AND LE FAT CLUB'S "CLUB SODA")

MALONE: Today's show was produced by Nick Fountain. Our editor is Bryant Urstadt. Our supervising producer is Alex Goldmark, who told me to tell you we could use reviews, too. PLANET MONEY likes reviews.

SCHELLMANN: But please don't fake it.

MALONE: No. Real reviews only.

SCHELLMANN: And special thanks to Fakespot, which is actually another similar software to ReviewMeta, which you can use to spot fake reviews. They have been really helpful.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone.

SCHELLMANN: And I'm Hilke Schellmann. Thanks for listening.

things. So just you know I'll be like in the grocery store and I'll
have like an avocado and a onion and a bottle of water. Whoa that's high
stakes. You drop an avocado you're buying that thing. Yeah. Yeah. The
story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews begins around 2006. Tommy was
in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time. He was 19 and he was a
bit of a gym rat. At his peak he could bench press around 240 pounds. One day
Tommy was hanging out with a friend. When he says, hey do you want the
rest of this pre-workout? Pre-workout that's like a powdered stimulant
you're supposed to take before you hit the gym. And it just gives you
crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder. You know at

friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased. And he says to
Tommy, I paid 60 bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that
it's ruining my workouts. It's you know counterproductive. If you're not

couldn't get the real situation but filling in is our very own Stacey
Vanik Smith. Very swole Stacey Vanik Smith. No one knows this. You can't
tell from my voice but I'm you know I'm huge. Stacey how much can you bench
press would you say? 300 pounds seems plausible. Like I could probably bench
press you Kenny. Yeah okay. Anyway Tommy's site became a place where
bodybuilders could share all kinds of supplement experiences including great
successes. This literally gives me skin splitting pumps no lie. I have
stretch marks all over and incredible gains. Overall rating 10. Maybe more
importantly the site was also a place where bodybuilders could tell
each other about problematic products. I am sure that this will be the last
day I take this sh**. I have heart palpitations and I'm not sure if tomorrow I
will wake up. Overall rating 5. Overall rating 5? I don't know I mean it
tasted pretty good. Okay well not everyone thought that same powder
tasted good. This stuff gave me a strong urge to vomit. Some sort of
strange circus going on in my stomach. Overall rating 1. Yeah there's a
lot of talk of stomach issues. Yeah and bloating. Is bloating a big problem? Yeah
yeah yeah. Bodybuilders were writing reviews and Tommy got a referral fee

Pandora station for this. Based off of a song from I call him dead Mao 5
but other people call him dead mouse. Sure. It's called take care of the
proper paperwork is the name of the song. This certainly must be in the top
10 songs named after paperwork don't you think. Yes there's a mind-numbing
sound of bureaucracy. That is pretty accurate. So Tommy is going through
every single review and essentially asking himself how do I know I can
trust this. I've got an Excel spreadsheet open and I got Amazon and
I've got like 500 tabs open on Amazon and I'm sitting there just look
at the next review tally updated look at the next review tally up. And
as he does this he starts to learn the tricks of online fake reviewers.
Some of them are not so tricky for example one review he noticed there was
a before and an after picture before super skinny guy after super ripped.
Tommy does a reverse image search and he finds the earliest example of the
photo on reddit. And I messaged that user on reddit and I said hey did you
also use this image for review and they said no. So busted. Yeah. A stolen
before and after picture obviously fake. As he investigates Tommy's also
starting to notice that some suspicious reviewers have almost like an M.O.
that he can identify and he starts naming these different types of
questionable reviewers. One category are the brand monogamous. So these
are people that only review products from one company over and over
again. Sure maybe that person really likes that company or maybe that
person works for that company. Another fake reviewer profile the one hit
wonders. These are people who review one thing and then never review
anything again. I mean obviously there are people that just review one
thing. That's totally a normal thing that happens. But if it happens a
lot and if those one hit wonders are giving the product a five star
across the board then you know again maybe there's something unnatural
about that. Yeah. Like if this testosterone booster had a bunch of
one hit wonders that were all really positive that is pretty
unnatural. But the most unnatural pattern Tommy found was this suspicious
flood of positive reviews around the exact same time. You know it was
like three days of you know this super high volume where I think
like 30 percent of the reviews were submitted. And that's fishy because
it is way more reviews than any other three day stretch. And they're
really positive reviews. So it looks like maybe Tommy says somebody
paid for a bunch of fake reviews around that time. The way this
sometimes works is that a seller might want to boost their rankings.
They want to sell more product and they need more positive reviews.
So there are sites where they can buy these fake reviews but then
those positive reviews all post around the same time. And so for
Tommy after reading through all those reviews learning the tricks
of the fake review trade what percentage of those five hundred and
eighty reviews did he think were tainted or biased in some way.
Probably all of them like nearly 100 percent or maybe 100 percent.
Yeah or something is wrong with them. So Tommy was on this mission
to clean up the fake reviews on his own website and then he looked
at Amazon and he finds out even Amazon has this gigantic problem
of BS reviews. Not only that if he ever wants to go on Amazon
and buy something again he's realizing he's going to have to
spend hours going review by review to figure out what is even
trustworthy. Or I could write a computer program to do all this
in seconds access these pages automatically pull the data and give
me a much better picture of the reviews. And I'm sitting there
thinking like and if I wrote that computer program to do all
this in seconds I could point it at any product. And so Tommy
Noonan went back to work and in essence he coded a version
of himself an Internet review detective that can help any of us
pull up an item on Amazon and cut through all the BS reviews
to find just the good ones. He started a new website that he
called review meta dot com. And after the break we'll go
shopping with it.

All right Hylke show me how review meta can help me get
over my fake review anxiety. Kenny what do you need.
I just was on vacation and my phone died four times
because I do not actually do not have any iPhone cables
anymore. Got it. So you go to Amazon and you put
in iPhone cables.
Yes. So we have over twenty thousand results for iPhone
cables. That's a lot. Yes this is where the anxiety
starts. So we're going to click on the one that we
like. All right. So this one has a hundred and seventy
seven reviews four stars like that looks great on the
surface. And then you take the URL copy it and then
you paste it into review meta. OK. And then I hit
run report and it runs a report. All right. And it
says computing computing bleep bleep bleep bleep
whatever it's going to take a while. It's reading
like one hundred seventy seven reviews it would take
me like five hours. At any rate eventually it spits
out a report and we got Tommy Noonan on the line
to walk us through a few of the things his website
flagged about these iPhone cable reviews. OK. So for
this product we see that over the course of five
days this product got 78 percent of their reviews
and on top of that the reviews from those high
volume days gave the product a four point nine
star rating on average. These reviews over those
five days pretty suspicious especially when you
look at the reviews from those five days
compared to the average reviews. They're way more
positive. Tommy says the reviews for these cables
a few other red flags as well. There was one
issue with words that were being used over and
over again in the reviews. OK. So the phrase
repetition basically what we do is we build a
gigantic list of all of the phrases that are
used in the reviews that are three words or
more. And then we go the algorithm is able to
filter out normal phrases that would show up
all the time. For example it was the and
this way the algorithm can look at weird
phrases that you would not expect to be
repeated. For example the cord is very tough and
doesn't bend like the cords do. But that's
probably a good thing. That's not you know
that you shouldn't see that in more than one
review. But for here we see it in three
reviews. Yeah. And in seven reviews someone
wrote it's easy to get it back onto the
cord and use again. I don't know what it
means but seven people feel that way. Well
seven people also say they performed their
duty with honor and respect. And there is the
incorrect version. Yeah. So Tommy's software
ran about a dozen different tests on our iPhone
cable reviews and his reports spit out an
adjusted rating. So it went from a four star
out of five with one hundred seventy seven
reviews on Amazon. And the adjusted rating
on review meta is one point seven stars
after 10 reviews. Which is another way of saying
Tommy site only trusted six percent of the
reviews and the trustworthy reviews say
actually these cables are crap. Tommy says
generally speaking cables like this are
exactly the kind of product that winds up
cluttered with suspicious reviews. Anything
with like low manufacturing costs and high
margins. So like what. Yeah. Yeah. iPhone
backup batteries screen protectors phone cases
weight loss pills testosterone. We of course
reached out to Amazon about this and they
declined to go on tape but they are familiar
with Tommy's website. They sent us an
extensive statement about it. Review meta
itself admits that they do not have the
data. Stacey Stacey you could do this one
as like a non weight lifter. Oh OK. Review
meta itself admits that they do not have
the data to know or even say with high
confidence whether a review is fake. According
to what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily
different from what Tommy told us about his
own website. He totally admits that his
site is looking for patterns of unusual
behavior and there's a possibility that real
reviews get flagged as unnatural. For Amazon
that is a problem. We have hundreds of
millions of reviews on Amazon and of that
total less than one percent are inauthentic.
Amazon also told us that it's investing
in its own system to catch fake reviewers.
In other words Amazon is saying there's not a
problem but we're working on it. And this
makes me like wonder a little bit how much
should I trust that big sites like Amazon
are actually going to go out of their way
to fix this. So it's complicated right
because these e-commerce sites they make
money when they sell more products. Right
like it doesn't matter if it's a positive
fake review if someone buys a product that's
good for the site. But there might come
a time where there's just too many fake
reviews. Sure like there's a tipping point
where enough trust is lost that we all
just give up. Yes. On internet shopping.
Yes. And we'll go back to France. To our
friends. To France. We will go back to
our friends for a recommendation. I was like do you want to go to France? Great.
Well yes there is a point where it just
ruins it for all of us. And we have
to go back to talking to our friends
again. Oh you have to call your mom. For
shopping advice. Yes. What toothpaste you
should use. That is a mom question.

to tell you we could use reviews too.
Planet Money likes reviews. But please
don't fake it. No real reviews only.
And special thanks to Fakespot which
is actually another similar software to
review meta which you can use to spot
fake reviews. They have been really
helpful. I'm Kenny Malone. And I'm
Hilka Schellman. Thanks for listening.
