**faster whisper:**
All right, Alex. I have you here. Where are we a block away from our office at a liquor store? That's right
I'm here taking you on a field trip because we are doing the rest of the story summer edition
I love this is one of my favorite episodes where we revisit past episodes and we find out what has happened since we aired them
We bring you updates and I gather because you brought me to a liquor store that we're going to revisit the episode
We did on vodka. Yes, you are correct. So remind us
The episode was about is there really a difference between cheap vodka and expensive vodka and no
Not really is what we came down to okay
But you did leave one question kind of hanging you claim that when you drink vodka cheap vodka you get flushed cheeks
But when you drink vodka during that episode your cheeks did not get flushed
I will concede that is how that episode ended. So we thought you might be making it up about this cheap vodka allergy
Maybe it's just in your head
But then after the episode aired we got all these emails from listeners who were like no no
No, this happens to me too with vodka
So we decided we're gonna give you another chance to prove that this vodka allergy is real
I am grateful that I'm getting a chance to redeem myself. Okay. All right. Well listen
We're serious journalists here at Planet Money
So we are going to fact-check your claim here and if you're right if your cheeks do get flushed
We will correct the record
Hello hi there, we're here to buy some some cheap vodka
All right, we're ready
Okay, but I don't want you to have to drink alone so I invited someone here to drink with you
Okay, I'm very intrigued. I think I see him outside. Let's go introduce you. Okay
How are you?
Good
Sam emailed us he's actually a Planet Money listener
And he said that he also gets these flesh-red cheeks from vodka the trouble is real. Yeah, you want to do us the honors sure
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Sam Pirov, right I'm Karen Duffin
I'm Alex Goldmark today on the show the rest of the story you two go drink. I'm gonna go back to the studio
I'm gonna get a bunch of updates on Bitcoin gift and goods
Pesticides and then I'm gonna come back to you too
and I actually have some information for you from a doctor about your alleged allergy and
Then we'll see if you got flushed if you did we'll set the record straight. I mean, okay
I'm just here to get red-faced

I'm Joshua Johnson the host of 1a we're spending a week at the Aspen ideas festival talking about this and other big issues
Check out our coverage on the 1a podcast
For our first update we are going back to episode number 775 the pigweed killer
In that episode we told you about a murder that came about because of a pesticide
And we have brought Dan Charles into the studio today to give us the update. Hi Karen
Hey Dan Dan you have been with us here at Planet Money this summer
But your day job is to be NPR's food and farming correspondent
And I was absolutely fascinated and obsessed actually with this story last year
Remind listeners if they did not hear the original episode what what happened?
So basically a fight broke out between farmers over weeds
Some farmers were killing their weeds with this pesticide a weed killer called
Dicamba and it worked for them because they were growing these special new soybeans that could survive Dicamba just fine
But Dicamba this chemical they're using it has a big problem
Which is it blows away it can just evaporate after you spray it and it kind of drifts across the landscape
Which is why at the time we did that episode
it was actually illegal to use Dicamba this way these farmers were breaking the law and
Dicamba was damaging crops in neighbors fields provoking fights and
There was a murder and what happened with that murder case a man named Alan Curtis Jones went on trial
He claimed self-defense, but the jury didn't buy it. They found him guilty of second-degree murder
He was sentenced to 24 years in prison
And the other thing that happened was the pesticide companies said they'd fixed Dicamba so it wouldn't drift
So it became legal to spray last year thousands of farmers started using Dicamba and maybe it wasn't fixed
Millions of acres of crops were damaged and it was most intense in Arkansas. That's where the problem was the worst
That's also where the murder happened and there it all landed in the lap of a regulatory body called the Arkansas State Plant Board
This is kind of like this the pesticide police in Arkansas and they have a lot of power
But these are just regular citizens who have regular lives like one I met is named Terry Fuller
He runs a farm supply business. So our people come into you and saying got to do something
Absolutely
farmers town people community people
Lined up we had as many as 15 people at the office before 7 o'clock in the morning on two or three different
occasions
All waiting to see you all waiting to see me. Did you ever feel sort of personally threatened it?
Somewhat there's two loaded guns in my office and I don't need to chamber around
I
Felt personally threatened somewhat and and what they decided to do was to actually go back to a ban
Basically say until you can figure out a way to prevent this damage
No farmer in Arkansas during the summer when the weather is hot and this drift happens
No farmer is allowed to spray Dicamba on their crops. Okay, so no farmers are spraying Dicamba in Arkansas
Well, that was the plan
Just last week. I called Terry Fuller back and I said well, is it working and he was not a happy camper
There's at least 5,000 acres of soybeans in Phillips County that shows symptom ology. Oh, wow
Curled up leaves stunted grows. This is crazy. This was just not supposed to happen this year
Not supposed to happen this year script absolutely correct. So people are breaking the law basically
Oh
Apparently yes
It seems like those volunteer regulators in Arkansas have not managed to fix the problem
The company said they were gonna fix it. They don't seem to have fixed the problem
So this is gonna land in front of the Environmental Protection Agency at the federal government level to see whether they are gonna let
This product stay on the market. Wow. Okay. All right. We'll keep an eye on weeds and before you leave Dan
I want you to settle something for us. We got literally hundreds if not thousands of tweets and emails
Challenging us on our use of the word pesticide in the original episode. Can you please settle this debate for us?
pesticides include both
insecticides and herbicides
Herbicides are a form of pesticide. We can't use pesticide. So please no more tweets and emails
We are all correct in this situation
All right. Thanks Dan my pleasure
We have Sally helm in the studio. Hi Karen. Hi Sally
So a couple of months ago you and Kenny Malone did a great episode about the Smoot-Hawley tariffs
And since those are what something like 90 years old now, we did not expect to have an update on them
We did not just a reminder the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were these protectionist tariffs that economists generally agree were a very bad idea
we called the episode worst tariffs ever it's number 833 and
After it aired we got an email from a listener who we were not expecting to hear from
Yeah, I'm there. Great. Well first I have to have you introduce yourself. So what is your full name?
Yeah, my name is Austin Smoot wait like Smoot Smoot-Hawley
Yes, Senator Reid Smoot who is one of the people responsible for this tariff act is Austin's great-great
Grandfather's brother. Okay. So did Austin know about the skeletons in his family's closet?
He did not know about this until he was in college sitting in an intro economics class during a class discussion
I raised my hand and I asked a question. I don't even recall what I had asked but professor goes
Yeah, great question
What did you say your name was and I responded I Austin Austin Smoot and he suddenly paused and he
Scanned over the whole classroom and it was a big class. I was probably like a hundred hundred fifty kids
It was one of those big auditorium ones and this little grin on his face and he just says a Smoot
Trying to learn basic economics, I've never heard of such a thing
and I
Think he was expecting that the class was just gonna erupt at this amazing joke that he had just told. Yeah
But fortunately, it was an intro to economics course. So there was just silence
Yeah, they had no idea okay, so his professors told the nerdiest of all jokes, is this how he finds out?
Yeah, he goes home after this class. He starts googling
He ends up googling for hours reading about the Smoot-Hawley-Terra fact and he actually had a paper
due soon after this for the class and he writes about the Smoot-Hawley-Terra fact turns it in early because he's so into it and
Not only that Karen as a result of this experience Austin Smoot
Changes his major from electrical engineering to finance and economics. Wow. I know. Yeah
Did you switch your major to sort of a tone?
Exactly, I'm trying to make up for the name and save my children
Because I'm sure they're gonna sit down one day in an economics class and when they call the roll
The exact same thing is gonna happen to them. No doubt
That professor from Austin's econ 101 class
He actually ended up hiring Austin to work at an economics think tank Austin did that for a little while now
He is an accounting analyst in Salt Lake City, Utah. All right, we'll see if he can clear the family name
Thanks, Sally. Thanks Karen
For this next update. I want you to take your mind back to episode
816 it was called Bitcoin losers and we told the story of this guy named
So who got some Bitcoin back when it was cheap
But he forgot to write down the key so he could not access his Bitcoin and we tried to help him find it
He did not find it. Our update is not that he did find it
but we did get this one email after the story ran and
Our beloved intern Aviva de Kornfeld was reading through these emails and she flagged it for us
And she's actually back here as a producer with us today in the studio. Hello Aviva. Hey Karen
okay, so the listener who emailed us her name is Nerissa Minnick and
When she sent this she was in the middle of this big move from New York to LA and while she was packing up
She of course was listening to Planet Money
Where she heard our reporter Kenny Malone helping still rummage through his attic for his lost Bitcoin and hearing this episode
She remembered like oh I bought cryptocurrency a few months ago and I also lost it
Did she do what still did she forget to write down her key kind of the opposite
She bought the cryptocurrency and I wrote down the secret key in my very very very bad handwriting and it's case sensitive
And it's 29 letters. Okay, so she wrote it down
But she couldn't read her own handwriting really, okay
So apparently we need to add one more piece of advice write it down
But legibly exactly so one of the lessons of the Bitcoin losers episode was that crypto is never really lost
The consultants make this claim that if you have even part of your key
Then there are these people called Bitcoin hunters and they can help you figure out your whole key and access your wallet
And so Nerissa heard this and emailed Kenny and said do you know anyone who can possibly help me?
And Kenny's like, yeah, here's this website and it leads her to this guy named Bitcoin Dave
Wait, that's his like his screen name. Yeah, that's his professional name. Okay Bitcoin
He's a Bitcoin hunter and he says just send me all of your information that you have every bit of your illegible key
And I'll see what I can do and we're our consultants, right?
Was it enough just to have like a few letters and numbers?
Yes, Bitcoin Dave was able to unlock Nerissa's wallet and she got back over
$40,000 worth of cryptocurrency
Minus Bitcoin Dave's 15% cut for doing all the hard work
Wow nice work Kenny Malone and Bitcoin Dave also to you right also Bitcoin Dave. Thanks Aviva. Thank you
For this next one. We are going to take you on an economic scavenger hunt
This comes from an episode of we did a couple of months ago where we took questions from listeners
Including this question from a listener named Brian Knowles who asked us to explain this very obscure economic term
Which is Giffen good and we brought in the great Patty Hirsch to help us explain it. He is here great Patty Hirsch
Thank you
You are here with us the sort of you're on the other side of the country at NPR West and
You are the editor of our daily podcast the indicator
Yes, and a Giffen good just to remind everybody is a staple commodity that sees increasing levels of demand
Even as its price rises, which defies like the most fundamental laws of economics, right?
Literally, it is like a unicorn of economics
All right
Usually if the price of something rises demand actually falls because consumers get ticked off at paying the high price and they buy cheaper
Alternatives. Okay, and your contention was that they used to exist, but they don't anymore
Exactly, there are so many alternatives to every commodity that we have particularly in the developed world that there really aren't any given goods around
There that's my contention. Okay. Well our listeners have a beef with that
We asked them
Can you send us your ideas for Giffen goods and we got a ton of answers
Some of them I think we can fairly safely say do not qualify like hot Cheetos and bison tongue
People also sent in like smartphones and the subway some of the things they sent in I think they might actually
qualify so I have asked you Patty to accept the solemn responsibility of deciding
Standing in judgment on whether or not these are in fact given goods
I hate to think of the idea that I mean judgmental towards our listeners, but okay. All right, bring it on. Okay. All right, so
We have from our listener back
Premium coffee
Premium coffee. Okay, I could see that. Yeah, the price of premium coffee goes up and therefore demand goes up
So the two go up together. Okay, I can see the dynamic. The problem is it's premium coffee, right?
It's not a staple if it was caught if it was Folgers or instant
I could see that but this is not even a state and there are all sorts of alternatives anyway
So I'm sorry does not qualify. All right hipsters. If you have hate mail send it directly to Patty. Oh, thanks
Okay, so this next one I had not heard about until gave wrote us in about toilet paper
He said that there was this huge toilet paper shortage in Taiwan in March because full prices were going up and
Manufacturers were saying they were that toilet paper prices were gonna go up
So there was like this huge panic buying of toilet paper
There was indeed I know about this very well
Actually, because I have a brother-in-law who lives in Taiwan
He was telling me about this and indeed there was a there was a run on toilet paper
I mean people were literally buying up crates of it in the stores
It was crazy. Um, okay, but here's the thing demand was high. Yes, but price did not rise
All right
So the reason the panic was created because people were expecting the prices to rise but they actually didn't so the panic was in
Fear of the high prices that never materialized prices actually stayed the same. So you get two out of three. Sorry
No, okay. Just the idea of a toilet paper shortage is making me feel anxious
Okay, I have one final contender and this came in various forms from lots of different people
Health care so people said sent in like niche drugs or emergency care
But the the one that I think might actually work is basic health care. Okay
So remember with a gift and good we're talking about a staple where the price
Rises and the demand rises at the same time and it's because you're giving up alternatives in order to take the cheaper option
So I guess maybe if you think about looking after your health
Maybe you're giving up vacation in order to make sure that you get good health care that you're treated. Well, I
Could see that as a possible. Yeah, I mean I'd really I think we'd have to take that apart a little bit
But I think that's a really interesting one to look at. I would say we have a definite contender. Oh my goodness
Finally, we have a winner basic health care
Patty is going to accept that as a gift and good. I'm gonna I'm gonna accept it, you know
I'm gonna look into it, but I'm certainly willing to open the door to it. Yeah. Thank you so much Patty
It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me
After the break we will return to Alex and our listener Sam who had faithfully been drinking vodka on behalf of journalism
We're back from the liquor store hanging out in the office and I will fact-check whether or not their cheeks did get flushed
This message comes from NPR sponsor HBO HBO's newest drama series is
Succession from Adam McKay director of The Big Short and in the loop writer
Jesse Armstrong comes the story of the Roy family owners of one of the biggest media companies in the world
Succession airs Sundays at 10 p.m. Only on HBO
Whether it's athlete protests the Muslim travel ban gun violence school reform or just the music that's giving you life right now
Race is the subtext to so much of the American story and on code switch
We make that subtext text you can listen to us on NPR one or wherever you get your podcasts
Everyone grab a mic. I have answers. I'm very excited about this. I
Wanted to know if a doctor could explain this alleged cheap vodka allergy. So I called one up
I'm Heather line Parker and I'm a physician and who else are you? I'm Karen's former roommate
That's right. And she explained to me that the liver turns alcohol into something that's really close to
Formaldehyde Wow, which can kind of make you flush and not feel good
This is like the thing that you used in science class where you would like I said cats exactly
And if you don't have enough of this one particular enzyme that gets rid of formaldehyde
the formaldehyde might hang out in your body and turn your cheeks red and
Genetically Asian people tend to have less of that particular enzyme. So this is sometimes called Asian flush
We actually got a ton of emails about this one
But since you're both white that one is probably not it
There is one theory that Heather thought might be
The reason why this is happening to you and it actually kind of validates something that the scientist in your episode said
Which is just the cheap vodka might not distill out all the extra byproducts of whatever
It's made out of like potatoes or whatever vodka from what I understand can come from any kind of stuff
If you let it from that long
You know of alcohol it kind of totally is and my guess would be your boss is having more of an allergy to
The other kind of broken down stuff
But for the more important question, which is did your cheeks get flushed?
Let me just take a look
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a little flesh you look like like one someone put like one round of blush on your cheeks
Yeah, I don't know how to
Evaluate like rounds of blush a little blush, but like no one's gonna be like, oh my god, hold off on the blush. Okay
I think this means we do need to correct the record
I think we can say that your alleged flush is real. Do you just feel very vindicated right now? I
Definitely do your show vindicated my feelings also. Wow, that makes me feel really good. Yeah. Thank you
I just want to say that. Yeah, I appreciate you. I think that wraps up the rest of the story
