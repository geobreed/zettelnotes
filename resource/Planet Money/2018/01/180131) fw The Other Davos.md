Billionaires, diplomats, thinkfluencers. This is the Davos everyone hears about. Today on the show, we take you to a different Davos.

Each year, the World Economic Forum takes place in Davos, a small ski town in the Swiss Alps. The goal of the conference is to promote international cooperation and collaboration, and ultimately improve the state of the world. It's filled with diplomats, CEOs, billionaires, and idea gurus.
#821: The Other Davos

But, all those powerful people gathered in one place means that Davos is a prime opportunity for business. Representatives from various countries come to the conference to woo the global elite to invest. Most countries do this by displaying their best stats, but one country has a different approach. In addition to the good stuff, this year, Saudi Arabia also shared their less favorable rankings. They came to Davos with a database of 700 indicators—both good and bad.

Today on the show, we find out what Saudi Arabia's up to, and why asking that question helps us understand a world viewed through ranks and ratings.

GREGORY WARNER (HOST): The World Economic Forum, which takes place each January in Davos, Switzerland, brings a lot of CEOs and the heads of state to a tiny town in the Swiss Alps. You may have heard that President Trump came this year. It's the kind of place where you can be online to the bathroom and meet a former ambassador. And if you just look at the titles of the panels, it's a pretty high-minded scene all about cooperation and making the world a better place. I went to a panel called the weaponization of culture with a Swedish minister and Yo-Yo Ma. There was another panel called "We Need To Talk About Privilege." I couldn't get a ticket to that. But there is a whole other Davos because when these CEOs and billionaires and diplomats go out of the high-security conference center dome and down to their private parties and events in hotels shaped like wedding cakes, they pass by a street called the Promenade.

Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen.

And down here at the Promenade, the scene is very different. You have countries that have rented out storefronts, trying to lure in the influential and powerful attendees.

Nice to meet you.

ADITYA NAGARAJAN: Nice to meet you likewise.

WARNER: Your name?

WARNER: My first stop is India House.

NAGARAJAN: A lot of people who told us that they've come specifically to the lawn just to eat the food, so it's been also, you know, a soft power kind of sorts.

WARNER: OK, so they come for the food, but they learn about the investment.

NAGARAJAN: It's mutually beneficial in both ways, though.

WARNER: This is Aditya Nagarajan. He points to a series of giant number ones printed on the wall.

NAGARAJAN: It's the No. 1 attractive investment destination globally. We're No. 1 in Global Retail Development Index. So all these panels over here are a reflection about how India means business.

WARNER: India means business.

NAGARAJAN: India means business.

WARNER: In fact, that's written on the door.

NAGARAJAN: Correct.

WARNER: But just pop a few doors down to a Timberland shop turned into Ukraine House, there instead of samosas and dried ginger, they're serving...

ANDREY KOLODYUK: Borscht - borscht is Ukraine, by the way. Don't trust Hollywood.

WARNER: Andrey Kolodyuk has got his list of the things that Ukraine is No. 1 in.

KOLODYUK: The Ukraine is No. 1 in Europe by the quantity of certified IT specialists.

WARNER: Wait - No. 1 in Europe in the quantity of certified IT specialists.

KOLODYUK: That's right.

WARNER: What about India, though? They have more IT specialists.

KOLODYUK: OK. If you want to go cheap, you go for India because you're going to pay twice more for Ukrainian programmers. Why? Because you will get the quality.

WARNER: Stepping out of Ukraine House, I go to the Indonesian pavilion for some chicken soto soup and talk about Jakarta startups. And by this point, I've realized two things about Davos. First, you never have to pay for food. Second, although the theme - at least in the billionaire bubble - is about saving the world, what it really feels like down on the street is Epcot Center for billionaires - you know, countries wooing investors by picking their favorite stats. But then something odd happens. I walk into the spot that Saudi Arabia has rented out. It's usually a Benetton clothing store. Now, it's draped in green, the color of the Saudi flag. And at first, it seems like the exact same song and dance. There's cardamom coffee being served in the corner and a jumbo TV screen with all of Saudi Arabia's number ones.

HUSAMEDDIN ALMADANI (ADAA): It was just telling - properties in Saudi Arabia is extremely affordable. It's actually zero-cost. That attracts a lot of investment.

WARNER: You're No. 1 in that, No. 1 in access to electricity...

ALMADANI: Exactly.

WARNER: ...No. 1 in tax payments.

ALMADANI: Exactly.

WARNER: But then, this funny thing happens. This guy who's pitching me this list - his name's Husameddin AlMadani - he clicks a button on the jumbo screen.

ALMADANI: So let's look at the bottom line.

WARNER: Let's do it.

ALMADANI: Great.

WARNER: And what pops up are Saudi Arabia's worst stats.

ALMADANI: CO2 emissions is something that we are very concerned about, and so this is something on our watch list. Diabetes prevalence - it's something also...

WARNER: The rankings here - they're what Saudi Arabia gets most criticized for, like having so few women in the workforce, having lots of migrants with few rights.

ALMADANI: There are things that we're not doing well, and there are things that we are doing well.

WARNER: While every other country on this Davos street is showcasing their No. 1 stats - their best rankings - Saudi Arabia has come to Davos with a different plan. They've got a database of 700 indicators, and any country can look up where they rank.

ALMADANI: Yeah, there is nothing to hide. This is public data. We are not shy about it.

WARNER: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Gregory Warner. Today on the show - what is Saudi Arabia's endgame? And why asking that question actually led me on a totally different quest, back up the mountain to figure out what happens when we see the world in ranks and ratings not just here on the Swiss Alps but everywhere.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

WARNER: Husam AlMadani - the guy I met from Saudi Arabia - he's 38 years old, he went to Harvard, and he's a self-described data obsessive.

ALMADANI: Fitbit is an example. So I'm obsessed with those 10,000 steps, even though my weight doesn't show.

WARNER: He tracks his steps. He tracks his sleep.

ALMADANI: When I sleep, I look at how many hours I slept. And if it is a certain number of hours, then I feel good.

WARNER: He tracks the ratings of the beaches and restaurants he visits on vacation with his family. He says he can't help it.

ALMADANI: Look, this generation loves data and loves technology.

WARNER: In this generation is also the 32-year-old crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman. And this story really starts when that prince was first appointed in 2015, and he called Husam into the palace.

ALMADANI: I remember that day when I was called in, and I do my interview at 2 a.m., with his royal highness, which was a bit - and I don't - I wasn't prepared.

WARNER: When Husam was called in for this 2 a.m. meeting, he'd already spent years working for Aramco, the Saudi oil company. And his big job was tracking performance and efficiency. Now, the prince told him to build a similar performance-tracking center for the entire country.

ALMADANI: He wanted to know how the country is doing accurately and timely. And second, he wanted to know how we are doing on the global map. How are we doing in the global indicators?

WARNER: How are we ranking?

ALMADANI: How are we ranking?

WARNER: So the Saudis built a control room.

ALMADANI: I'll say the name in Arabic, and then I'll say it in English. We say (speaking Arabic), which means the cockpit.

WARNER: And can you just describe that room for me? Is it a bunch of TV screens?

ALMADANI: It's actually - it looks like NASA. It's...

WARNER: Husam showed me pictures of the cockpit. It totally looks like ground control Houston, except instead of tracking rockets and satellites, they're tracking unemployment numbers and homeownership and something the Saudis used to call the Citizen Satisfaction Index.

Citizen Satisfaction Index - that's what it used to be called. Now it's called...

ALMADANI: Beneficiary satisfaction. So investors, residents, citizens - this is something that is a phenomenon and historical.

WARNER: Of course, other countries do have a way to gauge their satisfaction index. It's called an election. It's not perfect, of course, but at least it is one way we have that voters can rate the job the government is doing. Saudi Arabia is not a democracy. It's ruled by one royal family, and they're accountable to no one but themselves. And so they've designed an app.

ALMADANI: We are launching an app that allows any citizen or investor to immediately, on the spot, rate the government service that they received, and the feedback comes immediately to our reporting cycle.

WARNER: Goes right to the cockpit.

ALMADANI: It goes to the cockpit, and also goes to the ministers themselves.

WARNER: The crown prince, who hired Husam for this job - he's got big plans to diversify the economy, make it less dependent on oil. And to pay for these schemes, he plans to float an IPO in the largest oil company in the world, Husam's former employer, Aramco. So for the first time, foreign investors will be able to buy stock in that company. That means that Saudi Arabia has gone from being a country that didn't have to care what people thought of it to suddenly seeking favor with lots of foreign investors in foreign countries.

ALMADANI: Saudi Arabia is open. We're open for business. We're open for partnerships. We're open for learning, and we cannot embark on our transformation without being truly humble and interested to learn from others.

WARNER: Which actually brings us to why Saudi Arabia has shown up at Davos, why they've rented out this Benetton and presented this data to the global elite. What Husam says is that he's going to be meeting with business tycoons and global leaders to basically ask everyone the same thing.

ALMADANI: We are telling now the people in Davos, tell us how we can read this data differently. Are those the right indicators that talk of today's complex problems in the globe?

WARNER: With all of these indicators and rankings out there, what should Saudi Arabia focus on? What is actually the most relevant?

ALMADANI: Do you have a question?

WARNER: Yeah - no, I mean, I would like you to be more clear about what relevant means.

ALMADANI: Let's find out.

WARNER: So I said goodbye to Husam made plans with him to check back in at the end of the conference on Friday - find out what he'd learned - and as I walked back out of the sliding glass doors onto the slushy sidewalk, I was struck by the odd predicament that Saudi Arabia - and really lots of countries - seem to find themselves in. Where on the one hand, a country's rankings can be really important in terms of investment - Disney Corporation, for example, reportedly uses one index from the World Bank, the World Governance Index, to help it decide which countries to put its factories in. But those same countries, they can have very little say on what gets ranked or how.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Nice meeting you.

WARNER: Nice to meet you.

I started talking about this with folks I was meeting on the promenade here at Davos.

SANDRA RODRIGUEZ (MIT): I couldn't help but overhear - I just heard is the use of data...

WARNER: That's how I met Sandra Rodriguez. She's a sociologist and a fellow at MIT who's actually been thinking a lot about this very question.

RODRIGUEZ: Who's making the calls because ranking also means who gets to choose, what are you ranking? What's the best? What are you looking for to rank who as first and who as second?

WARNER: And Sandra remembers actually the year she started thinking a lot about this. It was 2006. She was going back and forth to Cameroon in West Africa from her home in Canada.

RODRIGUEZ: Our laws in Canada made it that our cellphones were kind of crappy. But not only that - they were very expensive. And you would arrive in Cameroon and suddenly you would have a lady under an umbrella with seven cellphones and people would just pay 25 cents to use them. And I was really impressed by the use of cellphones.

WARNER: Think about this - this was 12 years ago before smartphones. Cellphones - they were pretty expensive, and yet, the poorest Cameroonian could rent a phone for a moment to make a call or send a message.

RODRIGUEZ: But I do know that the big debate was the ranking because suddenly UN ranking decided that for a country to be digitally advanced it didn't mean anymore to have access to digital technology but to own it.

WARNER: And Sandra wasn't quite sure why these rankings changed - whether maybe the cellphone companies were involved - but she says what happened next was pretty clear. African countries went from high in the rankings to back down low.

RODRIGUEZ: Africa loses again. You know, North American countries win - Status quo. Some people are happy. Of course, most of the rest of the world isn't.

WARNER: This kind of politics can make it into even the driest sounding ranking. For instance, take the World Bank's ease of doing business index. A few years ago, the country Chile dropped hard in those rankings from around 35 in the world to around 55. And then this month, the chief economist at the World Bank, Paul Romer, revealed that this slide downward wasn't because Chile suddenly became a harder place to do business. It was that the World Bank had tweaked the methodology in a way that punished Chile, and it punished it right after the country elected a socialist president. This was such a scandal that Paul Romer, who had blown the whistle on this, ended up resigning six days later.

RODRIGUEZ: That just goes to show how hard it is to understand who rates in the first place the indexes that will be looked at.

WARNER: Do you think one of them is here at Davos?

RODRIGUEZ: There are probably a lot of them here. If you're looking for the Illuminati, that's something else (laughter).

WARNER: If I couldn't find the Illuminati, at least I could find some member of the indicator elite who must be here at Davos, right? Except that turned out to be not easy to do. I called the World Bank. Their senior staff were all booked up with meetings; same thing with the UN. I almost gave up and then I heard about a professor.

Professor Woods?

NGAIRE WOODS (UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD): Yeah, hi.

WARNER: Hi.

WOODS: You Gregory?

WARNER: Somebody with a pitch perfect Davos resume. She's a Rhodes Scholar, she's advised the IMF, she works here with the World Economic Forum, and she's a dean at Oxford. Professor Ngaire Woods agreed to give me a little bit of time.

Thanks for making this...

WOODS: They have me moderate more sessions than I should. And...

WARNER: We found a quiet corner and I told her about this quest I had to meet someone who makes the indicators. Are you them?

WOODS: No. But...

WARNER: Do you know them?

WOODS: Well, actually, sorry. That's not true. I mean, I have input into different indicators.

WARNER: In fact, she is in the middle of designing an important new indicator right now.

WOODS: What would a government effectiveness indicator look like?

WARNER: It's the government effectiveness indicator. She's doing it with Oxford. She's also consulted on other things like the UN Human Development Index.

WOODS: Which I've been involved with in the past...

WARNER: The Social Progress Index.

So I'm so glad I've achieved some of my mission. I met somebody who -

And while you'd think that all of this work fine-tuning the ranking of countries would make her more of a believer in the power of data, it's actually done the opposite. She is a total indicator skeptic.

WOODS: Countries vie here at Davos to be - to move up that list. You know, I'm going to come top or I'm going to move up two points, and that shows that when I was minister of the economy I really did great things. But actually, them reaching that indicator might just mean that they've passed a law. It might not mean that the law is being implemented or that it's being enforced or that it's actually changing anything on the ground.

WARNER: Talking to Ngaire, I suddenly got this sinking feeling. Here I was, up here on the mountain, finally face to face with a member of the Davos elite - an indicator-maker or adviser or whatever. And while down there in the rest of the world, you have countries and cities who are killing themselves to be first in the rankings. They are rankings that she apparently doesn't trust. But then the person I've met who helps measure the world tells me a secret.

WOODS: It's actually not about the measurement of them...

WARNER: It's not about the measurements. At this point, we were talking about how the United Nations has set all these ambitious goals for the year 2030 - goals like end hunger and end poverty.

WOODS: Now, if they'd just done that, everybody would have said it's hot air only. So now they've done a deeper exercise of saying here are all the different things we should measure under each one to measure progress towards them.

WARNER: For the next decade or more till the year 2030, countries will be arguing about who ranks better in ending poverty, in ending hunger. And yeah, those numbers will definitely be fudged, and they'll probably have politics in them. But she says that without the numbers - without some kind of scorecard - it's hard to get us to collaborate on anything. So even if these rankings don't actually tell us our real score, they may at least encourage us to play the same game. After the break, I bring that message from the mountain down to the promenade.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

WARNER: Friday morning - the final day of the conference - I came back down to the promenade to talk with Husam from Saudi Arabia in his storefront. I got to say, I was kind of nervous to tell him what I'd learned on the mountain because, remember, he and his team had spent all this time putting together an iPad app that had all these hundreds of indicators and exactly where every country ranked. He'd come to Davos to present this thing and what I'd heard from the people on the mountain was that they don't take these rankings all that seriously. But it turned out that Husam had been hearing that line all week.

ALMADANI: Spot on, and I am very overwhelmed by this feedback. What indicates - no, we've been hearing this as data is good, indicators are fine, but the discussions we can have.

WARNER: But when you say spot on, I'm so surprised that you say that because I thought you would say, no, no, this data is science.

ALMADANI: Data is data. Just establish that data will always have some biases, right?

WARNER: After all his meetings at Davos, one thing Hasam wants to do is take this iPad app with all its thousands of graphs and charts and rankings of countries and add a comment section so you could actually criticize the rank or the number you've been given. It's literally turning the number - the score - into the beginning of a conversation. And that's a lot more messy than his first version with all its clean lines. But maybe it's more the way the world works.

WARNER: We'd love to hear what you think of the show. Send us an email. We're at planetmoney@npr.org. Or find us on Facebook or Twitter. We'll have a link to Saudi Arabia's measurement tool. It's called the International Performance Hub. You can find out where your country ranks. That's on our website, npr.org/money. Today's show was produced by Sally Helm. Our senior producer is Alex Goldmark, and Bryant Urstadt edits the show. If you're looking for something else to listen to, I host a different podcast. It's called Rough Translation. We're hard at work on our second season. Our first season is out in the world. If you haven't heard it, go give it a listen. It has stories about how the things that we are talking about here in the United States - how they're playing out somewhere else in the world. It's called Rough Translation. You can find it wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Gregory Warner. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
The World Economic Forum, which takes place each January
in Davos, Switzerland, brings a lot of CEOs
and the heads of state to a tiny town in the Swiss Alps.
You may have heard that President Trump came this year.
It's the kind of place where you can be online
to the bathroom and meet a former ambassador.
And if you just look at the titles of the panels,
it's a pretty high-minded scene,
all about cooperation and making the world a better place.
I went to a panel called the Weaponization of Culture
with a Swedish minister and Yo-Yo Ma.
There was another panel called
We Need to Talk About Privilege.
I couldn't get a ticket to that.
But there is a whole other Davos.
Because when these CEOs and billionaires and diplomats
go out of the high security conference center dome
and down to their private parties
and events in hotels shaped like wedding cakes,
they pass by a street called the Promenade.
Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen.
And down here at the Promenade, the scene is very different.
You have countries that have rented out storefronts,
trying to lure in the influential and powerful attendees.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you likewise.
My first stop is India House.
A lot of people who told us
that they've come specifically to the lounge
just to eat the food.
So it's been also a soft power kind of sorts.
Okay, so they come for the food,
but they learn about the investment.
It's mutually beneficial in both ways, though.
This is Aditya Nagarajan.
He points to a series of giant number ones
printed on the wall.
It's the number one attractive investment destination
globally, the number one in global
retail development index.
So all these panels over here are a reflection
about how India means business.
India means business.
India means business.
In fact, that's written on the door.
Correct.
But just pop a few doors down
to a Timberland shop turned into Ukraine House.
There, instead of samosas and dried ginger,
they're serving.
Borsch.
Borsch is Ukraine, by the way.
Don't trust Hollywood.
Andrei Kolodyuk has got his list
of the things that Ukraine is number one in.
The Ukraine is number one in Europe
by the quantity of certified IT specialists.
Wait, number one in Europe
in the quantity of certified IT specialists?
That's right.
What about India, though?
They have more IT specialists.
Okay.
If you wanna go cheap, you go for India
because you're gonna pay twice more
for Ukrainian programmers.
Why?
Because you will get the quality.
Stepping out of Ukraine House,
I go to the Indonesian Pavilion
for some chicken soto soup
and talk about Jakarta startups.
By this point, I've realized two things about Davos.
First, you never have to pay for food.
Second, although the theme,
at least in the billionaire bubble,
is about saving the world,
what it really feels like down on the street
is Epcot Center for Billionaires.
Countries wooing investors
by picking their favorite stats.
But then something odd happens.
I walk into the spot that Saudi Arabia has rented out.
It's usually a Benetton clothing store.
Now it's draped in green,
the color of the Saudi flag.
At first, it seems like the exact same song and dance.
There's cardamom coffee being served in the corner
and a jumbo TV screen
with all of Saudi Arabia's number ones.
Registering properties in Saudi Arabia
is extremely affordable.
It's actually zero cost.
That attracts a lot of investment.
Number one in that.
Number one in access to electricity.
Exactly.
Number one in tax payments.
Exactly.
But then this funny thing happens.
This guy who's pitching me this list,
his name's Hussamuddin Al-Madani,
he clicks a button on the jumbo screen.
So let's look at the bottom line.
Let's do it. Great.
And what pops up are Saudi Arabia's worst stats.
CO2 emissions is something that we are very concerned about
and so this is something on our watch list.
Diabetes prevalence, it's something...
The rankings here,
they're what Saudi Arabia gets most criticized for,
like having so few women in the workforce,
having lots of migrants with few rights.
There are things that we're not doing well
and there are things that we are doing well.
While every other country on this Davos street
is showcasing their number one stats,
their best rankings,
Saudi Arabia has come to Davos with a different plan.
They've got a database of 700 indicators
and any country can look up where they rank.
Yeah, there is nothing to hide.
This is public data.
We are not shy about it.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Gregory Warner.
Today on the show, what is Saudi Arabia's end game?
And why asking that question
actually led me on a totally different quest.
Back up the mountain to figure out
what happens when we see the world in ranks and ratings,
not just here on the Swiss Alps, but everywhere.

Hassam Al-Madani, the guy I met from Saudi Arabia,
he's 38 years old, he went to Harvard
and he's a self-described data obsessive.
Fitbit is an example,
so I'm obsessed with those 10,000 steps
even though my weight doesn't show.
He tracks his steps, he tracks his sleep.
When I sleep, I look at how many hours I slept
and if it is a certain number of hours,
then I feel good.
He tracks the ratings of the beaches
and restaurants he visits on vacation with his family.
He says he can't help it.
Look, this generation loves data and loves technology.
In this generation is also the 32-year-old
crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman.
And this story really starts
when that prince was first appointed in 2015
and he called Hassam into the palace.
I remember that day when I was called in
and I do my interview at 2 a.m.
with his royal highness,
which was a bit, and I wasn't prepared.
When Hassam was called in for this 2 a.m. meeting,
he'd already spent years working for Aramco,
the Saudi oil company,
and his big job was tracking performance and efficiency.
Now the prince told him to build
a similar performance tracking center
for the entire country.
He wanted to know how the country is doing
accurately and timely.
And second, he wanted to know
how we are doing on the global map.
How are we doing in the global indicators?
How are we ranking?
How are we ranking?
So the Saudis built a control room.
I'll say the name in Arabic and then I'll say it
in English.
We say it Qumrat Adda, which means the cockpit.
And can you just describe that room for me?
Is it a bunch of TV screens?
Actually, it looks like NASA.
Hassam showed me pictures of the cockpit.
It totally looks like ground control Houston,
except instead of tracking rockets and satellites,
they're tracking unemployment numbers and homeownership
and something the Saudis used to call
the Citizen Satisfaction Index.
Citizen Satisfaction Index.
That's what it used to be called.
Now it's called?
Beneficiary Satisfaction.
So investors, residents, citizens,
this is something that is phenomenal and historical.
Of course, other countries do have a way
to gauge their Satisfaction Index.
It's called an election.
It's not perfect, of course,
but at least it is one way we have
that voters can rate the job the government is doing.
Saudi Arabia is not a democracy.
It's ruled by one royal family
and they're accountable to no one but themselves.
And so they've designed an app.
We are launching an app that allows any citizen
or investor to immediately on the spot
rate the government service that they received
and the feedback comes immediately to our reporting cycle.
Goes right to the cockpit.
It goes to the cockpit
and also it goes to the ministers themselves.
The crown prince who hired Hassam for this job,
he's got big plans to diversify the economy,
make it less dependent on oil.
And to pay for these schemes,
he plans to float an IPO
in the largest oil company in the world,
Hassam's former employer, Aramco.
So for the first time,
foreign investors will be able to buy stock
in that company.
That means that Saudi Arabia has gone
from being a country that didn't have to care
what people thought of it
to suddenly seeking favor with lots of foreign investors
in foreign countries.
Saudi Arabia is open.
We are open for business.
We are open for partnerships.
We are open for learning
and we cannot embark on our transformation
without being truly humble
and interested to learn from others.
Which actually brings us to why Saudi Arabia
has shown up at Davos,
why they've rented out this Benetton
and presented this data to the global elite.
What Hassam says is that he's gonna be meeting
with business tycoons and global leaders
to basically ask everyone the same thing.
We're telling now the people in Davos,
tell us how we can read this data differently.
Are those the right indicators
that talk of today's complex problems in the globe?
With all of these indicators and rankings out there,
what should Saudi Arabia focus on?
What is actually the most relevant?
Do you have a question?
Yeah, I mean, I would like you to be more clear
about what relevant means.
Let's find out.
So I said goodbye to Hassam,
made plans with him to check back in
at the end of the conference on Friday,
find out what he'd learned.
And as I walked back out of the sliding glass doors
onto the slushy sidewalk,
I was struck by the odd predicament that Saudi Arabia
and really lots of countries seem to find themselves in.
Where on the one hand,
a country's rankings can be really important
in terms of investment.
Disney Corporation, for example,
reportedly uses one index from the World Bank,
the World Governance Index,
to help it decide which countries to put its factories in.
But those same countries,
they can have very little say on what gets ranked or how.
I started talking about this with folks
I was meeting on the promenade here at Davos.
That's how I met Sandra Rodriguez.
She's a sociologist and a fellow at MIT
who's actually been thinking a lot
about this very question.
Who's making the calls?
Because ranking also means who gets to choose
what are you ranking?
What's the best?
What are you looking for to rank who as first
and who as second?
Sandra remembers actually the year
she started thinking a lot about this.
It was 2006.
She was going back and forth to Cameroon in West Africa
from her home in Canada.
Our laws in Canada made it that our cell phones
were kind of crappy, but not only that,
they were very expensive.
And you would arrive in Cameroon
and suddenly you would have a lady under an umbrella
with seven cell phones
and people would just pay 25 cents to use them.
And I was really impressed by the use of cell phones.
Think about this.
This was 12 years ago, before smartphones.
Cell phones, they were pretty expensive.
And yet the poorest Cameroonian could rent a phone
for a moment to make a call or send a message.
But I do know that the big debate was the ranking
because suddenly UN ranking decided that
for a country to be digitally advanced,
it didn't mean any more to have access
to digital technology, but to own it.
Sandra wasn't quite sure why these rankings changed,
whether maybe the cell phone companies were involved,
but she says what happened next was pretty clear.
African countries went from high in the rankings
to back down low.
Africa loses again, you know,
North American countries win, status quo.
Some people are happy.
Of course, most of the rest of the world isn't.
This kind of politics can make it into
even the driest sounding ranking.
For instance, take the World Bank's ease
of doing business index.
A few years ago, the country Chile dropped hard
in those rankings from around 35 in the world
to around 55.
And then this month, the chief economist
at the World Bank, Paul Romer,
revealed that this slide downward wasn't
because Chile suddenly became a harder place
to do business.
It was that the World Bank had tweaked the methodology
in a way that punished Chile.
And it punished it right after the country
elected a socialist president.
This was such a scandal that Paul Romer,
who'd blown the whistle on this,
ended up resigning six days later.
That just goes to show how hard it is
to understand who rates in the first place
the indexes that will be looked at.
Do you think one of them is here at Davos?
There are probably a lot of them here.
If you're looking for the Illuminati,
that's something else.
If I couldn't find the Illuminati,
at least I could find some member of the indicator elite
who must be here at Davos, right?
Except that turned out to be not easy to do.
I called the World Bank.
Their senior staff were all booked up with meetings.
Same thing with the UN.
I almost gave up.
And then I heard about a professor.
Yeah, hi.
Hi.
Somebody with a pitch perfect Davos resume.
She's a Rhodes scholar.
She's advised the IMF.
She works here with the World Economic Forum
and she's a dean at Oxford.
Professor Narey Woods agreed to give me
a little bit of time.
They have me moderate more sessions than I should.
We found a quiet corner
and I told her about this quest I had
to meet someone who makes the indicators.
Are you them?
No, but do you know them?
Sorry, that's not true.
I mean, I have input into different indicators.
In fact, she is in the middle
of designing an important new indicator right now.
What would a government effectiveness indicator
look like?
It's the government effectiveness indicator.
She's doing it with Oxford.
She's also consulted on other things
like the UN Human Development Index.
Which have been involved within the past.
The Social Progress Index.
So I'm so glad I've achieved some of my mission.
I met somebody who-
And while you'd think that all of this work,
fine tuning the ranking of countries
would make her more of a believer in the power of data,
it's actually done the opposite.
She is a total indicator skeptic.
Countries vie here at Davos to be,
to move up that list.
I'm gonna come top or I'm gonna move up two points.
And that shows that when I was minister of the economy,
I really did great things.
But actually, them reaching that indicator
might just mean that they've passed a law.
It might not mean that the law is being implemented
or that it's being enforced
or that it's actually changing anything on the ground.
Talking to Neri, I suddenly got this sinking feeling.
Here I was, up here on the mountain,
finally face to face with a member of the Davos elite,
an indicator maker or advisor or whatever.
And while down there in the rest of the world,
you have countries and cities
who are killing themselves to be first in the rankings,
they're rankings that she apparently doesn't trust.
But then the person I've met who helps measure the world
tells me a secret.
It's actually not about the measurement of them.
It's not about the measurements.
At this point, we were talking about
how the United Nations has set all these ambitious goals
for the year 2030.
Goals like end hunger and end poverty.
Now, if they'd just done that,
everybody would have said it's hot air only.
So now they've done a deeper exercise of saying,
here are all the different things we should measure
under each one to measure progress towards them.
For the next decade or more till the year 2030,
countries will be arguing about who ranks better
in ending poverty, in ending hunger.
And yeah, those numbers will definitely be fudged
and they'll probably have politics in them.
But she says that without the numbers,
without some kind of scorecard,
it's hard to get us to collaborate on anything.
So even if these rankings don't actually tell us
our real score, they may at least encourage us
to play the same game.
After the break, I bring that message from the mountain
down to the promenade.

Friday morning, the final day of the conference,
I came back down to the promenade
to talk with Hassam from Saudi Arabia in his storefront.
I gotta say, I was kinda nervous
to tell him what I'd learned on the mountain
because remember he and his team had spent all this time
putting together an iPad app
that had all these hundreds of indicators
and exactly where every country ranked.
He'd come to Davos to present this thing
and what I'd heard from the people on the mountain
was that they don't take these rankings
all that seriously.
But it turned out that Hassam
had been hearing that line all week.
Spot on and I'm very overwhelmed by this feedback.
What indicate, now we've been hearing this
is data is good, indicators are fine
but the discussions we can have.
But when you say spot on,
I'm so surprised that you say that
because I thought you would say no, no,
this data is science.
Data is data, I just established
that data will always have some biases, right?
After all his meetings at Davos,
one thing Hassam wants to do is take this iPad app
with all its thousands of graphs and charts
and rankings of countries and add a comment section
so you could actually criticize the rank
or the number you've been given.
It's literally turning the number, the score,
into the beginning of a conversation
and that's a lot more messy than his first version
with all its clean lines.
But maybe it's more the way the world works.
