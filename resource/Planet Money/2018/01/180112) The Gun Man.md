Will 3-D printing make gun control impossible?

Cody Wilson makes gun-making machines. Depending whom you ask, he's either one of the most dangerous people in the world, or a hero of the first amendment.

Cody's never sold a gun. He's never killed anyone. And, to his knowledge, none of the guns he's made have ever killed anyone. So, how did Cody Wilson end up on the frontline of the debate over gun control? He ended up there, not by selling guns, but by creating ways for anyone to make their own gun.
Planet Money
#817: The Gun Man

Cody's game-changing tool? 3D printers.

In the world he's made, guns don't need to move from person to person across a counter. Instead, they're hacked together using blueprints that Cody has helped distribute.

Today on the show, we follow a man who wants a world with many guns, no regulations, and a somewhat scary amount of freedom.

NOEL KING, HOST:

Getting into Cody's car - there is just a pistol hanging out. There is just a pistol hanging out in the passenger seat. So I'm going to - I'm just going to be careful. I'm going to hang onto this thing until he gets back in the car and says that it is not loaded. I'm holding it away from me.

The gun belongs to Cody Wilson. And depending on who you ask, Cody is either one of the most dangerous people in the world, or he's a 29-year-old punk pulling a prank, or he's a hero of the First Amendment.

What's the status of this puppy? Does this gun shoot? Is this thing loaded? Is this thing a danger to either one of us?

CODY WILSON: Well, it is a gun, you see.

KING: Cody is hard to pin down. What I do know is that he doesn't like regulations or government or the state. He does like guns.

WILSON: You don't admire this as a work of art? I mean, I saw the way you held it. You held it like - well, like, with a measure of disgust. But...

KING: No, not disgust. My dad always said, hold it away from you, so you don't shoot your damn self.

WILSON: I see. You know what? Fair enough.

KING: Cody and I are going to Best of the West, which is a shooting range outside of Austin, Texas. We're running late, and the sun's getting lower. And so we pull in in a rush.

WILSON: They're going to close in, like, an hour 15. I'm just going to say something to them. You don't even have to get out.

KING: I'll wait here.

So he goes to check in, and he gets our tactical bay booked. And then he gives me orange earplugs. Cody does not look dangerous. He has dark hair and dark eyes and a little dimple in his chin. He's got a baby face. He also makes eye contact like maybe someone has spoken to him about the importance of making eye contact. So anyway, he lays the guns out on the table. And these are mostly guns that he has made.

WILSON: This is a Glock. This is an M1911 single stack 45. This is a standard, military-configured Colt AR-15.

KING: If you know guns, you know the AR-15. And if you don't know guns, this is the one you've seen a bunch on TV. AR-15 rifles and AR-style rifles were used at the movie theater shooting in Colorado and the concert shooting in Las Vegas and others.

Are you going to let me shoot the AR-15 or no?

WILSON: Absolutely. If you want to shoot it, you can shoot it.

KING: I don't have any particular love for guns as objects. I don't have any particular revulsion for them, either, unless they're used to kill or to hurt people. My father owned guns. And I don't know if I want to shoot that AR-15. But at the same time, I don't want Cody to think that I'm scared to shoot it. So...

WILSON: You're leaning back a bit. Just kind of get that foot forward and come forward into it a bit.

KING: Got you.

WILSON: Find your cheek well.

KING: Cheek well.

WILSON: You comfortable with that? Yeah, I like that. I like that.

KING: OK.

WILSON: All right. Let me put you on fire. If you want to do it with your own thumb, you can.

KING: I do.

WILSON: Bring your thumb up and just pull that down.

KING: Pull that down.

WILSON: You can fire at will.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

KING: I'm out.

WILSON: Hell's bells. After only, like, three rounds with it, you look like a natural, you know?

KING: Maybe I'm just one of those people. Or do you think everyone's just one of those people?

WILSON: I have a sneaking suspicion we're all one of those people.

KING: Yeah. OK.

Cody Wilson is a gunmaker. But he's never sold a gun, and he's never killed anyone. And as far as he knows, none of the guns he's made have ever killed anyone. So why do people think Cody Wilson is so dangerous?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KING: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Noel King.

ELIZABETH KULAS, HOST:

And I'm Elizabeth Kulas. People think Cody Wilson is dangerous not because he makes guns but because he's made a way for anyone to make their own gun. And in that world that he's made, guns don't need to move from person to person in a store. Instead, they're hacked together using information that's free and easy to find on the Internet.

KING: Yeah. These are guns that can go viral and potentially make gun control impossible.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KING: Elizabeth.

KULAS: Noel.

KING: I think we all know someone a little bit like Cody Wilson. He's the kind of person who takes a good idea like free speech, and then he runs with it. And he runs with it so far that it starts to make people nervous. He really likes shocking people. And his main idea is freedom. Every decision in Cody's life comes down to, does this make me more free? He's the kind of guy who reads Nietzsche, and he talks about anarchy. And you're thinking, have you thought this through? Because anarchy actually seems kind of terrible. Cody calls himself a crypto-anarchist. It is not clear, though, if this group actually wants to claim him back.

KULAS: There's a reason why Cody wants to align himself with this group. It's because they have a lot in common. Crypto-anarchists believe that the anonymity of the Internet is going to bring about anarchy. It's a world that they want to see, but it's also a world that they think is inevitable, a world that's coming. We're at a point now where the Internet allows you to evade censorship and taxes and laws. And so they figure, why would anybody follow the rules?

KING: And, you know, a lot of these guys live in their heads. And then they get out of high school or college. And, like, they calm down. You know, they go off to law school. That is exactly what Cody Wilson did. He went to law school. But then he realized he hated law school.

WILSON: I felt fully superfluous in law school, and it felt like a complete waste of my time. And I was going to school with, like, tradesmen more than, you know, inquirers. Not to insult them, of course.

KULAS: Of course. But Cody wanted to change the world. He just had to figure out something world-changing. So one day, he's on the phone with a college buddy. They used to spitball all the time about ways that they could raise mischief. And his friend says, what if we made a gun? And at first, Cody's like, well...

WILSON: Everybody makes guns. That's nothing special. That's nothing new. You're not doing anything there. You're just becoming, you know, another tradesmen, you know?

KULAS: But then his friend says, no, no, no. Listen.

WILSON: I just remember him saying, well, you know, what about 3-D printing? We could 3-D print a gun.

KING: Wait. Wait. Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

WILSON: (Laughter) It was just like that. I have no prior experience with 3-D printing. I think I'd heard of it in passing like maybe other people had at the time.

KING: But it was that low-key? Hey, Cody, we could 3-D print a gun.

WILSON: Yeah. It was about, you know, a couple minutes into that. I'm like, if that is possible, that's one of the most exciting things, actually, that had ever occurred to me.

KULAS: In 2012, low-cost 3-D printers are taking off. Cody describes the 3-D printer that he was going to use like an elevated hot glue gun. It takes softened plastic, and, using digital blueprints, it piles layer upon layer of plastic into whatever shape you want.

KING: 3-D printers aren't just getting cheaper. They're also getting smaller. They have these ones that you can fit on your kitchen table. So people are using them at home. And they're making simple, solid objects like toys and figurines. But as far as Cody can tell, no one's ever used a 3-D printer to make a gun and then made the blueprints public.

KULAS: If he can pull this off, people won't have to go into a gun store and stand at a counter to buy a gun. He'll put a digital blueprint online for free. And then anyone can take it and improve on it and 3-D print their own gun.

KING: He does a little bit of research. And he figures that to lease a high-grade 3-D printer and to hire an engineer, he needs about $20,000. So he starts a campaign on a crowdfunding site. He makes a video. And he's sitting there in, like, a peach-colored church shirt, looking about 14 years old and talking about his idea for a wiki weapon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WILSON: The product isn't our emphasis here. What we're interested in producing is a digital file, the file itself to be shared across the Internet. Let me explain.

KULAS: What Cody's saying here is, I'm not interested in making and selling actual physical guns. I'm interested in the free exchange of ideas.

KING: A lot of people watch the video, but no one is really giving him any money. He gets a handful of calls. There's one dude from West Texas who gets in touch and says, hey. This is a great project. I'd like to help.

WILSON: Told me he was a multimillionaire in West Texas, and he had a big oil company. I checked out and checked it out. It checked out. He had an oil company. The guy had helped finance some scientific - I mean, it all checked out. I was like, wow. He's rich. He's curious. He's kind of mad - kind of mad cat, you know? He's willing to give a kid a chance. Oh, and he got me. He was the first guy to get me. I had never been catfished by the insane before.

KING: This gentleman apparently really just wanted to talk on the phone. So in three weeks, Cody had only raised a couple thousand dollars, and the needle was stuck.

KULAS: And then the crowdfunding site suspends him. They're like, hey, we're the platform where you come to fundraise for, like, a smart toothbrush, not a gun. At the same time, though, Cody gets a break. A reporter from Forbes magazine hears about what he's planning, calls him up and asks, like, are you for real? And Cody is like, yeah. I sure am. So he gets a profile in Forbes. First line of the article - Cody Wilson has a simple dream.

KING: Cody Wilson has a simple dream. And after that, the money comes pouring in. It's just a handful of people, but they are people who are really behind him. He raises almost $20,000, and he can finally lease a 3-D printer.

KULAS: A beautiful 3-D printer, by the way. The delivery truck rolls up, and the back door opens.

WILSON: They lifted it down on a pallet. And I tore it down off a pallet beside my apartment complex, like, in West Campus.

KING: He'd gotten his printer. But then a couple days later, he gets an email from the printer company's lawyers. And the email says basically, hey, kid. We heard about you. You're trying to use our printer to make a gun. We will be picking it up from your apartment tomorrow.

WILSON: Well, I hadn't made a lot of progress. I hadn't unboxed most of it, in fact.

KING: It was still in the box?

WILSON: I had only had it for a few days - a couple days tops, I think. They came into my house. They took the boxes out. They put them on the truck on the lift gate. And I watched it go.

KING: So his printer is now gone. But rather than back down, he gets defiant. Now he needs to do this because not doing it would be losing.

KULAS: He figures by now, no one else is going to sell him or lease him a printer. But he has a backup plan. He knows a small 3-D printing shop in Austin, and the owners are game.

WILSON: There were a couple of dudes in a machine shop on St. Elmo in Austin, Texas. They wanted to have some fun.

KING: Cody does scale back his ambitions a little bit. He decides he doesn't need these guys to 3-D print him an entire gun. The engineering part of this is actually really difficult. So he's just going to have them print a single gun part.

KULAS: Because there was a gun part - a single gun part - that had already been printed with a 3-D printer. Another gunsmith had done it. He put those blueprints online. It was the lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle.

KING: The lower receiver is the part that makes the gun a gun. It's the foundation. It houses the magazine with the rounds and the firing mechanism. The receiver is also the part of the gun where you have the serial number. It's the part of the gun that you need a background check to buy. So if you can 3-D print one of these things, you're making a gun part without needing a background check that has no serial number. And that can be turned into an untraceable gun.

KULAS: So Cody hands over the digital blueprints to the company. And they call him the next morning.

WILSON: They ushered me into the back room. They said, look. It's ready. It was finished for you. They lifted the printer head, and bay opened. And we took it out, separated it from the plate. And it was beautiful. And there was this sheen on it, this kind of material that needs to be removed from it. It's kind of, like - we call it, like, the afterbirth - this beautiful stuff that needs to be removed. They cleaned it up for me literally like it had been born, you know? And they - I put it in my gun case. And we just - hit my heart - I felt full of purpose. I felt powerful, even. I brought it to my car immediately after that. I put it in the passenger seat of my car.

KING: And he drove straight to the house of a machinist he knew outside of Austin. And when he got there, the sun was setting, and there were all of these people, all of these gun enthusiasts who'd heard about what this kid was trying to pull off. So he takes the receiver out of the case, and he passes it around.

WILSON: You know, it was green. It was fleshy. It was strange. Even the seasoned gun guys were, like, wow. You know, it's not comparable to much.

KULAS: They had a big potluck dinner to celebrate. Cody slept on the floor that night. And the next morning, he and the machinist drove out to the machinist's shop. The machinist took out the 3-D printed lower receiver, adds the other parts. And they had an AR-15. The question now was, though, did they have a working AR-15? So they drive out to the hill country to find out.

KING: And, of course, Cody takes a video of all this and puts it up online.

WILSON: I posted up on a steel target. I had my glasses on. And I squeezed. I shot. And I heard it hit.

(SOUNDBITE OF SHOOTING STEEL TARGET)

WILSON: I felt the gun kind of pulse in my shoulders. But I looked down, and it had survived. I don't know. It was probably the greatest day of my life.

KULAS: He'd done it. It had worked. He had printed a gun part - a crucial gun part - from blueprints that he could now share with anyone online.

KING: It wasn't a whole gun, which is what he wanted. But this was a big step forward. Remember, Cody was still a law student. And about a month after he shot that video, he was in a big lecture hall, about to sit an exam. And he's taking his stuff out of his bag. And his phone pings, and there is a text from Andy, the reporter who profiled him in Forbes. And the text says...

WILSON: Does this change your project? Does this change what you're going to do? I don't know what he means.

KING: So he puts it out of his mind until the exam is over. And a couple hours later, he gets out into the hallway. And he's making his way down a hill to his car.

WILSON: Andy sent me another text during the exam. He said - it just said Newtown, Conn. That's the only thing it said. So I googled Newtown, Conn. And I found exactly what had happened. And I won't lie to you. I thought, OK. I'm ahead of this. That's what I thought.

KING: What do you mean, I'm ahead of this?

WILSON: I knew immediately this was going to be a big one. This was going to be - the next four or five months were going to be about American gun control and the attempted bills - the bills in the House, bills in the Senate, the president's efforts. You know, we were going to start selling and campaigning on - I just knew that that engine was starting up. I knew it.

KING: There are people who are going to want to know why your first thought wasn't a bunch of small children have been shot and killed in a school. I'm trying to understand a thought process that goes directly to, I'm out in front of this instead of...

WILSON: Yeah.

KING: ...Oh, my God.

WILSON: The thing that I cared about was that I had a project. I had a duty to fidelity, to the truth of that project. Like, I was going to make it happen. And this, in my mind, upped it, upped the ante. But, as well, I began to see in the next days and weeks - I began to see that people began to take a passionate interest in my project - not, oh, this is cool. This is curious. What a cool, new tech idea. People began to think and to say, you must win. You must do it. They're going to take this stuff away from us. So we went from being a kind of curiosity on the Internet to people needing us, saying that they needed us to win and to do this. It's about the politics first for me.

KING: I need to just jump in and ask you...

WILSON: There were - like a human...

KING: Do you have an emotional...

WILSON: Yeah.

KING: ...Human response to the death of children - small children - in a classroom with a gun? Do - I'm trying to understand if you are feeling anything about that.

WILSON: I know this matters. Like, in a sense, I'm a social casualty of a climate of persistent, you know, like, mass shootings and stuff. I mean, it's not - the first thought you have, sadly, is that, OK, yeah. There's another shooting. This is babies. This is babies murdered. I get that, OK?

KING: But do you feel it?

WILSON: I get it and feel it. I understand that it is bad. But I'm already in a place - like an activist mentality - what is going to be done with this event? How is this going to be used? How is this going to be used against me? Look. I mean, that's where I am.

KING: OK. Obviously, Cody and I were not going to see this the same way. But, Elizabeth, you heard what he was saying there. He was saying we were afraid that the government was going to come and take our guns away. He was not the only person thinking that. The truth is we know that after mass shootings, gun sales tend to go up. But after Newtown, their fears didn't really come true. This country didn't pass any really significant, national gun-control laws.

KULAS: But something else did happen here, something that was big in Cody's world. The community that he'd belonged to those makers, the people playing around with 3-D printers online - they turned on him and people like him. They started pulling off their websites, anything that had to do with 3-D printing weapons and guns. This infuriated Cody. He was like, screw them. He doubles down, makes his own website. He takes all those blueprints and digital files that are being dumped, and he puts them back online.

KING: So he's raising the stakes here. And then he raises them to a point where they can't get much higher. Remember, he was still determined to 3-D print an entire working gun. And after a couple months, he did it. This little pistol called the Liberator - it worked. It was a real, working, 3-D printed gun. He takes the Liberator blueprints, and he puts them on his website. And in the next two days, 100,000 people from all over the world download them. Twenty-four hours after that, Cody gets a letter from the U.S. State Department. And for something written in legalese, it is very clear that he is in enormous trouble.

KULAS: The letter said Cody may be in violation of something called ITAR.

KING: ITAR.

KULAS: The International Traffic in Arms Regulation. ITAR is a set of regulations that controls the export of munitions, of weapons from the U.S. to any other country. And there are lots of rules about which weapons can be sent outside of the U.S. and where they can be sent.

KING: And the State Department's letter to Cody says, look. When you uploaded those blueprints to the Internet, you exported weapons overseas.

WILSON: Each download to a foreign person was a violation. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of violations.

KING: Hundreds of thousands of violations that you personally are responsible for.

WILSON: It's basically like being a gunrunner on the Internet or something.

KING: I mean, his website didn't just have the blueprints for his 3-D printed pistol. There were blueprints for other guns. There were blueprints for an anti-aircraft warhead.

KULAS: But he's not exporting actual guns or weapons, right?

KING: Yeah. And this is where it gets complicated. ITAR controls distribution of hardware, software and technical data. The State Department is saying these digital blueprints count as technical data.

KULAS: OK. So what he's doing really is against U.S. law.

KING: I mean, it really depends. The State Department says, look. You didn't get a license to upload this content, and that is the rule with exports. You want to export something? You need approval. Well, he didn't ask for approval. So OK.

KULAS: But if you follow the state department's rules to the letter, you can see that they're very, very restrictive. I mean, they can basically classify anything they want as technical data. And yet at the same time, legally, ITAR cannot be used to restrict free speech. There's legal precedent for that. And we have an example of just how tricky this can get.

KING: Yes. Elizabeth, you are an Australian citizen.

KULAS: I am.

KING: You are. OK. And so let's say, right here in studio, I'm going to tell you how to make a very simple pistol. Step one. Step two. Step three. Bang. Here's how you do it. Cody's lawyer, who, of course, is on Cody's side - he says if you interpret ITAR strictly, I've just exported a gun to Australia.

KULAS: Illegally.

KING: Yes, illegally. Illegally. I could get in trouble. And this is what Cody was facing. He could be in trouble. The thing is, whether you like Cody or not, you have to imagine a world where the government gets to decide that I can't tell you, Elizabeth, certain things because that is technically exporting munitions.

KULAS: And that feels a whole lot like restricting free speech.

KING: Yes. And it did to Cody, too. He did take his website down. He was facing 20 years in prison and a million-dollar fine for each foreign download. But the word got out. And there are a lot of lawyers out there who are really interested in not restricting the First Amendment and also a lot of lawyers who are interested in the complexities of ITAR. So Cody hires some of them, and he sues the State Department.

And his legal strategy is this - the stuff he put online, the digital blueprints - that's not technical data. That is speech. Some of the top lawyers in the country are now working for Cody. His case has been kicked around the lower courts in Texas. He and his lawyers actually tried to get the Supreme Court to hear it and recently found out that the Supreme Court will not. So it's going back to a lower court in Texas.

KULAS: But, you know, Cody points out the genie is already out of this bottle. 3-D printed guns are real. They're happening now. And in many ways, it doesn't really matter what the government says.

WILSON: The whole conversation had been fixed since the late '80s about what American gun control was always going to look like and how we were going to, through gradualism, kind of get to - I don't know - some consensus place. And in a sense, that argument is still repeated every day when there's a mass shooting. OK - this balance between, well, we've got to control things, and, you know, this kind of person can buy a gun. This kind of person can't. But, of course, that's all exploded in a world where you can just download whatever gun you want.

KING: Which is the world you want.

WILSON: It's the world I've made.

KULAS: After the break, how you take a dangerous idea and make it even more dangerous.

KING: I've been talking to Cody for a few weeks about what he's doing now. He is still taking good ideas like free speech and then taking them very, very far. His latest project is a crowdfunding platform called Hatreon. It lets people donate money to personalities including white supremacists like Andrew Anglin and Richard Spencer, who have been kicked off other platforms. He's giving them a home. And he is also in manufacturing now.

So here's what he's doing. The government pulled him offline, yes. So he started manufacturing gun mills. This is hardware - computer-controlled mills. A mill is a black, steel box. It's very heavy. It's about a foot by a foot. And inside of it is a drill, a cutter that can move in three dimensions. It can make AR-15 lower receivers with no serial number. Gun control advocates call these ghost guns. So Cody, as kind of a middle finger, calls his mill the Ghost Gunner. It can also take a metal frame like a pistol frame and make it into a weapon, which Cody actually showed me.

WILSON: It comes in a pistol frame and comes out a legal firearm.

KING: Cody's company has sold about 4,500 of these mills. They go for around $1,700. And think it's tempting to look at them and think, well, that's not as big a deal as 3-D printing, right? It's just a mill.

KULAS: But you know that reporter that Cody was talking about, Andy? His name is Andy Greenberg, and he's a writer for Wired magazine now. We called him up. And he said, don't be mistaken. These mills are really significant. They make it easy to make untraceable gun parts. Those parts are made of metal, not plastic. And as an experiment, Andy even tried to do this himself.

ANDY GREENBERG: And so it sounds almost like an infomercial. But that is the result of the experiment. It works very easily. It was a piece of cake. It did create a durable, metal lower receiver for a semi-automatic rifle and had no serial number that nobody knew about except me. And I did it in, like, the back of - back room of Wired's office in San Francisco.

KULAS: Andy started writing about Cody, assuming that lawmakers would freak out when they heard about this guy. Legislation would be passed to ban ghost guns. I mean, he really believed that was going to happen. California does have a ban on the books that will take effect later this year. And Cody has gotten the attention of a handful of other lawmakers. But aside from that, largely nothing has changed.

KING: Anyway, Cody and I stayed at the shooting range until just about sunset. And then this guy rolled up in a golf cart.

So I'm holding a weapon. Who is this?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You got two minutes left.

WILSON: Two minutes?

KING: Two minutes left?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: 17:30 - final ceasefire.

WILSON: Thank you, sir.

KING: 17:30 - final ceasefire. Thank you, sir.

So I ask Cody, hey, can I take your picture? And he says, yeah. Of course. And he picks up one of the rifles. And I put my camera phone at him. And he, like, deliberately makes this really mean, angry face.

You don't even look like Cody that I've come to know today. You look like a gunman. You look like a gunman. You look like an actual gunman.

WILSON: Yeah. I'm the guy that helps you make the guns. I'm the gun man.

KING: Elizabeth, he was totally performing. And I wanted to say that. I wanted to say, you are performing. But I knew that he'd turn it on me, and he'd say, well, you know what? You're performing, too. And then, Cody being Cody, it would turn into this whole philosophical fight. And to be honest, the place was closing, and I was tired. So I let it go. I helped him put the guns back in the car. And we left.
