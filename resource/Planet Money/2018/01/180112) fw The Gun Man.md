Will 3-D printing make gun control impossible?

Cody Wilson makes gun-making machines. Depending whom you ask, he's either one of the most dangerous people in the world, or a hero of the first amendment.

Cody's never sold a gun. He's never killed anyone. And, to his knowledge, none of the guns he's made have ever killed anyone. So, how did Cody Wilson end up on the frontline of the debate over gun control? He ended up there, not by selling guns, but by creating ways for anyone to make their own gun.
Planet Money
#817: The Gun Man

Cody's game-changing tool? 3D printers.

In the world he's made, guns don't need to move from person to person across a counter. Instead, they're hacked together using blueprints that Cody has helped distribute.

Today on the show, we follow a man who wants a world with many guns, no regulations, and a somewhat scary amount of freedom.

NOEL KING, HOST:

Getting into Cody's car - there is just a pistol hanging out. There is just a pistol hanging out in the passenger seat. So I'm going to - I'm just going to be careful. I'm going to hang onto this thing until he gets back in the car and says that it is not loaded. I'm holding it away from me.

The gun belongs to Cody Wilson. And depending on who you ask, Cody is either one of the most dangerous people in the world, or he's a 29-year-old punk pulling a prank, or he's a hero of the First Amendment.

What's the status of this puppy? Does this gun shoot? Is this thing loaded? Is this thing a danger to either one of us?

CODY WILSON: Well, it is a gun, you see.

KING: Cody is hard to pin down. What I do know is that he doesn't like regulations or government or the state. He does like guns.

WILSON: You don't admire this as a work of art? I mean, I saw the way you held it. You held it like - well, like, with a measure of disgust. But...

KING: No, not disgust. My dad always said, hold it away from you, so you don't shoot your damn self.

WILSON: I see. You know what? Fair enough.

KING: Cody and I are going to Best of the West, which is a shooting range outside of Austin, Texas. We're running late, and the sun's getting lower. And so we pull in in a rush.

WILSON: They're going to close in, like, an hour 15. I'm just going to say something to them. You don't even have to get out.

KING: I'll wait here.

So he goes to check in, and he gets our tactical bay booked. And then he gives me orange earplugs. Cody does not look dangerous. He has dark hair and dark eyes and a little dimple in his chin. He's got a baby face. He also makes eye contact like maybe someone has spoken to him about the importance of making eye contact. So anyway, he lays the guns out on the table. And these are mostly guns that he has made.

WILSON: This is a Glock. This is an M1911 single stack 45. This is a standard, military-configured Colt AR-15.

KING: If you know guns, you know the AR-15. And if you don't know guns, this is the one you've seen a bunch on TV. AR-15 rifles and AR-style rifles were used at the movie theater shooting in Colorado and the concert shooting in Las Vegas and others.

Are you going to let me shoot the AR-15 or no?

WILSON: Absolutely. If you want to shoot it, you can shoot it.

KING: I don't have any particular love for guns as objects. I don't have any particular revulsion for them, either, unless they're used to kill or to hurt people. My father owned guns. And I don't know if I want to shoot that AR-15. But at the same time, I don't want Cody to think that I'm scared to shoot it. So...

WILSON: You're leaning back a bit. Just kind of get that foot forward and come forward into it a bit.

KING: Got you.

WILSON: Find your cheek well.

KING: Cheek well.

WILSON: You comfortable with that? Yeah, I like that. I like that.

KING: OK.

WILSON: All right. Let me put you on fire. If you want to do it with your own thumb, you can.

KING: I do.

WILSON: Bring your thumb up and just pull that down.

KING: Pull that down.

WILSON: You can fire at will.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)

KING: I'm out.

WILSON: Hell's bells. After only, like, three rounds with it, you look like a natural, you know?

KING: Maybe I'm just one of those people. Or do you think everyone's just one of those people?

WILSON: I have a sneaking suspicion we're all one of those people.

KING: Yeah. OK.

Cody Wilson is a gunmaker. But he's never sold a gun, and he's never killed anyone. And as far as he knows, none of the guns he's made have ever killed anyone. So why do people think Cody Wilson is so dangerous?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KING: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Noel King.

ELIZABETH KULAS, HOST:

And I'm Elizabeth Kulas. People think Cody Wilson is dangerous not because he makes guns but because he's made a way for anyone to make their own gun. And in that world that he's made, guns don't need to move from person to person in a store. Instead, they're hacked together using information that's free and easy to find on the Internet.

KING: Yeah. These are guns that can go viral and potentially make gun control impossible.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KING: Elizabeth.

KULAS: Noel.

KING: I think we all know someone a little bit like Cody Wilson. He's the kind of person who takes a good idea like free speech, and then he runs with it. And he runs with it so far that it starts to make people nervous. He really likes shocking people. And his main idea is freedom. Every decision in Cody's life comes down to, does this make me more free? He's the kind of guy who reads Nietzsche, and he talks about anarchy. And you're thinking, have you thought this through? Because anarchy actually seems kind of terrible. Cody calls himself a crypto-anarchist. It is not clear, though, if this group actually wants to claim him back.

KULAS: There's a reason why Cody wants to align himself with this group. It's because they have a lot in common. Crypto-anarchists believe that the anonymity of the Internet is going to bring about anarchy. It's a world that they want to see, but it's also a world that they think is inevitable, a world that's coming. We're at a point now where the Internet allows you to evade censorship and taxes and laws. And so they figure, why would anybody follow the rules?

KING: And, you know, a lot of these guys live in their heads. And then they get out of high school or college. And, like, they calm down. You know, they go off to law school. That is exactly what Cody Wilson did. He went to law school. But then he realized he hated law school.

WILSON: I felt fully superfluous in law school, and it felt like a complete waste of my time. And I was going to school with, like, tradesmen more than, you know, inquirers. Not to insult them, of course.

KULAS: Of course. But Cody wanted to change the world. He just had to figure out something world-changing. So one day, he's on the phone with a college buddy. They used to spitball all the time about ways that they could raise mischief. And his friend says, what if we made a gun? And at first, Cody's like, well...

WILSON: Everybody makes guns. That's nothing special. That's nothing new. You're not doing anything there. You're just becoming, you know, another tradesmen, you know?

KULAS: But then his friend says, no, no, no. Listen.

WILSON: I just remember him saying, well, you know, what about 3-D printing? We could 3-D print a gun.

KING: Wait. Wait. Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

WILSON: (Laughter) It was just like that. I have no prior experience with 3-D printing. I think I'd heard of it in passing like maybe other people had at the time.

KING: But it was that low-key? Hey, Cody, we could 3-D print a gun.

WILSON: Yeah. It was about, you know, a couple minutes into that. I'm like, if that is possible, that's one of the most exciting things, actually, that had ever occurred to me.

KULAS: In 2012, low-cost 3-D printers are taking off. Cody describes the 3-D printer that he was going to use like an elevated hot glue gun. It takes softened plastic, and, using digital blueprints, it piles layer upon layer of plastic into whatever shape you want.

KING: 3-D printers aren't just getting cheaper. They're also getting smaller. They have these ones that you can fit on your kitchen table. So people are using them at home. And they're making simple, solid objects like toys and figurines. But as far as Cody can tell, no one's ever used a 3-D printer to make a gun and then made the blueprints public.

KULAS: If he can pull this off, people won't have to go into a gun store and stand at a counter to buy a gun. He'll put a digital blueprint online for free. And then anyone can take it and improve on it and 3-D print their own gun.

KING: He does a little bit of research. And he figures that to lease a high-grade 3-D printer and to hire an engineer, he needs about $20,000. So he starts a campaign on a crowdfunding site. He makes a video. And he's sitting there in, like, a peach-colored church shirt, looking about 14 years old and talking about his idea for a wiki weapon.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WILSON: The product isn't our emphasis here. What we're interested in producing is a digital file, the file itself to be shared across the Internet. Let me explain.

KULAS: What Cody's saying here is, I'm not interested in making and selling actual physical guns. I'm interested in the free exchange of ideas.

KING: A lot of people watch the video, but no one is really giving him any money. He gets a handful of calls. There's one dude from West Texas who gets in touch and says, hey. This is a great project. I'd like to help.

WILSON: Told me he was a multimillionaire in West Texas, and he had a big oil company. I checked out and checked it out. It checked out. He had an oil company. The guy had helped finance some scientific - I mean, it all checked out. I was like, wow. He's rich. He's curious. He's kind of mad - kind of mad cat, you know? He's willing to give a kid a chance. Oh, and he got me. He was the first guy to get me. I had never been catfished by the insane before.

KING: This gentleman apparently really just wanted to talk on the phone. So in three weeks, Cody had only raised a couple thousand dollars, and the needle was stuck.

KULAS: And then the crowdfunding site suspends him. They're like, hey, we're the platform where you come to fundraise for, like, a smart toothbrush, not a gun. At the same time, though, Cody gets a break. A reporter from Forbes magazine hears about what he's planning, calls him up and asks, like, are you for real? And Cody is like, yeah. I sure am. So he gets a profile in Forbes. First line of the article - Cody Wilson has a simple dream.

KING: Cody Wilson has a simple dream. And after that, the money comes pouring in. It's just a handful of people, but they are people who are really behind him. He raises almost $20,000, and he can finally lease a 3-D printer.

KULAS: A beautiful 3-D printer, by the way. The delivery truck rolls up, and the back door opens.

WILSON: They lifted it down on a pallet. And I tore it down off a pallet beside my apartment complex, like, in West Campus.

KING: He'd gotten his printer. But then a couple days later, he gets an email from the printer company's lawyers. And the email says basically, hey, kid. We heard about you. You're trying to use our printer to make a gun. We will be picking it up from your apartment tomorrow.

WILSON: Well, I hadn't made a lot of progress. I hadn't unboxed most of it, in fact.

KING: It was still in the box?

WILSON: I had only had it for a few days - a couple days tops, I think. They came into my house. They took the boxes out. They put them on the truck on the lift gate. And I watched it go.

KING: So his printer is now gone. But rather than back down, he gets defiant. Now he needs to do this because not doing it would be losing.

KULAS: He figures by now, no one else is going to sell him or lease him a printer. But he has a backup plan. He knows a small 3-D printing shop in Austin, and the owners are game.

WILSON: There were a couple of dudes in a machine shop on St. Elmo in Austin, Texas. They wanted to have some fun.

KING: Cody does scale back his ambitions a little bit. He decides he doesn't need these guys to 3-D print him an entire gun. The engineering part of this is actually really difficult. So he's just going to have them print a single gun part.

KULAS: Because there was a gun part - a single gun part - that had already been printed with a 3-D printer. Another gunsmith had done it. He put those blueprints online. It was the lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle.

KING: The lower receiver is the part that makes the gun a gun. It's the foundation. It houses the magazine with the rounds and the firing mechanism. The receiver is also the part of the gun where you have the serial number. It's the part of the gun that you need a background check to buy. So if you can 3-D print one of these things, you're making a gun part without needing a background check that has no serial number. And that can be turned into an untraceable gun.

KULAS: So Cody hands over the digital blueprints to the company. And they call him the next morning.

WILSON: They ushered me into the back room. They said, look. It's ready. It was finished for you. They lifted the printer head, and bay opened. And we took it out, separated it from the plate. And it was beautiful. And there was this sheen on it, this kind of material that needs to be removed from it. It's kind of, like - we call it, like, the afterbirth - this beautiful stuff that needs to be removed. They cleaned it up for me literally like it had been born, you know? And they - I put it in my gun case. And we just - hit my heart - I felt full of purpose. I felt powerful, even. I brought it to my car immediately after that. I put it in the passenger seat of my car.

KING: And he drove straight to the house of a machinist he knew outside of Austin. And when he got there, the sun was setting, and there were all of these people, all of these gun enthusiasts who'd heard about what this kid was trying to pull off. So he takes the receiver out of the case, and he passes it around.

WILSON: You know, it was green. It was fleshy. It was strange. Even the seasoned gun guys were, like, wow. You know, it's not comparable to much.

KULAS: They had a big potluck dinner to celebrate. Cody slept on the floor that night. And the next morning, he and the machinist drove out to the machinist's shop. The machinist took out the 3-D printed lower receiver, adds the other parts. And they had an AR-15. The question now was, though, did they have a working AR-15? So they drive out to the hill country to find out.

KING: And, of course, Cody takes a video of all this and puts it up online.

WILSON: I posted up on a steel target. I had my glasses on. And I squeezed. I shot. And I heard it hit.

(SOUNDBITE OF SHOOTING STEEL TARGET)

WILSON: I felt the gun kind of pulse in my shoulders. But I looked down, and it had survived. I don't know. It was probably the greatest day of my life.

KULAS: He'd done it. It had worked. He had printed a gun part - a crucial gun part - from blueprints that he could now share with anyone online.

KING: It wasn't a whole gun, which is what he wanted. But this was a big step forward. Remember, Cody was still a law student. And about a month after he shot that video, he was in a big lecture hall, about to sit an exam. And he's taking his stuff out of his bag. And his phone pings, and there is a text from Andy, the reporter who profiled him in Forbes. And the text says...

WILSON: Does this change your project? Does this change what you're going to do? I don't know what he means.

KING: So he puts it out of his mind until the exam is over. And a couple hours later, he gets out into the hallway. And he's making his way down a hill to his car.

WILSON: Andy sent me another text during the exam. He said - it just said Newtown, Conn. That's the only thing it said. So I googled Newtown, Conn. And I found exactly what had happened. And I won't lie to you. I thought, OK. I'm ahead of this. That's what I thought.

KING: What do you mean, I'm ahead of this?

WILSON: I knew immediately this was going to be a big one. This was going to be - the next four or five months were going to be about American gun control and the attempted bills - the bills in the House, bills in the Senate, the president's efforts. You know, we were going to start selling and campaigning on - I just knew that that engine was starting up. I knew it.

KING: There are people who are going to want to know why your first thought wasn't a bunch of small children have been shot and killed in a school. I'm trying to understand a thought process that goes directly to, I'm out in front of this instead of...

WILSON: Yeah.

KING: ...Oh, my God.

WILSON: The thing that I cared about was that I had a project. I had a duty to fidelity, to the truth of that project. Like, I was going to make it happen. And this, in my mind, upped it, upped the ante. But, as well, I began to see in the next days and weeks - I began to see that people began to take a passionate interest in my project - not, oh, this is cool. This is curious. What a cool, new tech idea. People began to think and to say, you must win. You must do it. They're going to take this stuff away from us. So we went from being a kind of curiosity on the Internet to people needing us, saying that they needed us to win and to do this. It's about the politics first for me.

KING: I need to just jump in and ask you...

WILSON: There were - like a human...

KING: Do you have an emotional...

WILSON: Yeah.

KING: ...Human response to the death of children - small children - in a classroom with a gun? Do - I'm trying to understand if you are feeling anything about that.

WILSON: I know this matters. Like, in a sense, I'm a social casualty of a climate of persistent, you know, like, mass shootings and stuff. I mean, it's not - the first thought you have, sadly, is that, OK, yeah. There's another shooting. This is babies. This is babies murdered. I get that, OK?

KING: But do you feel it?

WILSON: I get it and feel it. I understand that it is bad. But I'm already in a place - like an activist mentality - what is going to be done with this event? How is this going to be used? How is this going to be used against me? Look. I mean, that's where I am.

KING: OK. Obviously, Cody and I were not going to see this the same way. But, Elizabeth, you heard what he was saying there. He was saying we were afraid that the government was going to come and take our guns away. He was not the only person thinking that. The truth is we know that after mass shootings, gun sales tend to go up. But after Newtown, their fears didn't really come true. This country didn't pass any really significant, national gun-control laws.

KULAS: But something else did happen here, something that was big in Cody's world. The community that he'd belonged to those makers, the people playing around with 3-D printers online - they turned on him and people like him. They started pulling off their websites, anything that had to do with 3-D printing weapons and guns. This infuriated Cody. He was like, screw them. He doubles down, makes his own website. He takes all those blueprints and digital files that are being dumped, and he puts them back online.

KING: So he's raising the stakes here. And then he raises them to a point where they can't get much higher. Remember, he was still determined to 3-D print an entire working gun. And after a couple months, he did it. This little pistol called the Liberator - it worked. It was a real, working, 3-D printed gun. He takes the Liberator blueprints, and he puts them on his website. And in the next two days, 100,000 people from all over the world download them. Twenty-four hours after that, Cody gets a letter from the U.S. State Department. And for something written in legalese, it is very clear that he is in enormous trouble.

KULAS: The letter said Cody may be in violation of something called ITAR.

KING: ITAR.

KULAS: The International Traffic in Arms Regulation. ITAR is a set of regulations that controls the export of munitions, of weapons from the U.S. to any other country. And there are lots of rules about which weapons can be sent outside of the U.S. and where they can be sent.

KING: And the State Department's letter to Cody says, look. When you uploaded those blueprints to the Internet, you exported weapons overseas.

WILSON: Each download to a foreign person was a violation. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of violations.

KING: Hundreds of thousands of violations that you personally are responsible for.

WILSON: It's basically like being a gunrunner on the Internet or something.

KING: I mean, his website didn't just have the blueprints for his 3-D printed pistol. There were blueprints for other guns. There were blueprints for an anti-aircraft warhead.

KULAS: But he's not exporting actual guns or weapons, right?

KING: Yeah. And this is where it gets complicated. ITAR controls distribution of hardware, software and technical data. The State Department is saying these digital blueprints count as technical data.

KULAS: OK. So what he's doing really is against U.S. law.

KING: I mean, it really depends. The State Department says, look. You didn't get a license to upload this content, and that is the rule with exports. You want to export something? You need approval. Well, he didn't ask for approval. So OK.

KULAS: But if you follow the state department's rules to the letter, you can see that they're very, very restrictive. I mean, they can basically classify anything they want as technical data. And yet at the same time, legally, ITAR cannot be used to restrict free speech. There's legal precedent for that. And we have an example of just how tricky this can get.

KING: Yes. Elizabeth, you are an Australian citizen.

KULAS: I am.

KING: You are. OK. And so let's say, right here in studio, I'm going to tell you how to make a very simple pistol. Step one. Step two. Step three. Bang. Here's how you do it. Cody's lawyer, who, of course, is on Cody's side - he says if you interpret ITAR strictly, I've just exported a gun to Australia.

KULAS: Illegally.

KING: Yes, illegally. Illegally. I could get in trouble. And this is what Cody was facing. He could be in trouble. The thing is, whether you like Cody or not, you have to imagine a world where the government gets to decide that I can't tell you, Elizabeth, certain things because that is technically exporting munitions.

KULAS: And that feels a whole lot like restricting free speech.

KING: Yes. And it did to Cody, too. He did take his website down. He was facing 20 years in prison and a million-dollar fine for each foreign download. But the word got out. And there are a lot of lawyers out there who are really interested in not restricting the First Amendment and also a lot of lawyers who are interested in the complexities of ITAR. So Cody hires some of them, and he sues the State Department.

And his legal strategy is this - the stuff he put online, the digital blueprints - that's not technical data. That is speech. Some of the top lawyers in the country are now working for Cody. His case has been kicked around the lower courts in Texas. He and his lawyers actually tried to get the Supreme Court to hear it and recently found out that the Supreme Court will not. So it's going back to a lower court in Texas.

KULAS: But, you know, Cody points out the genie is already out of this bottle. 3-D printed guns are real. They're happening now. And in many ways, it doesn't really matter what the government says.

WILSON: The whole conversation had been fixed since the late '80s about what American gun control was always going to look like and how we were going to, through gradualism, kind of get to - I don't know - some consensus place. And in a sense, that argument is still repeated every day when there's a mass shooting. OK - this balance between, well, we've got to control things, and, you know, this kind of person can buy a gun. This kind of person can't. But, of course, that's all exploded in a world where you can just download whatever gun you want.

KING: Which is the world you want.

WILSON: It's the world I've made.

KULAS: After the break, how you take a dangerous idea and make it even more dangerous.

KING: I've been talking to Cody for a few weeks about what he's doing now. He is still taking good ideas like free speech and then taking them very, very far. His latest project is a crowdfunding platform called Hatreon. It lets people donate money to personalities including white supremacists like Andrew Anglin and Richard Spencer, who have been kicked off other platforms. He's giving them a home. And he is also in manufacturing now.

So here's what he's doing. The government pulled him offline, yes. So he started manufacturing gun mills. This is hardware - computer-controlled mills. A mill is a black, steel box. It's very heavy. It's about a foot by a foot. And inside of it is a drill, a cutter that can move in three dimensions. It can make AR-15 lower receivers with no serial number. Gun control advocates call these ghost guns. So Cody, as kind of a middle finger, calls his mill the Ghost Gunner. It can also take a metal frame like a pistol frame and make it into a weapon, which Cody actually showed me.

WILSON: It comes in a pistol frame and comes out a legal firearm.

KING: Cody's company has sold about 4,500 of these mills. They go for around $1,700. And think it's tempting to look at them and think, well, that's not as big a deal as 3-D printing, right? It's just a mill.

KULAS: But you know that reporter that Cody was talking about, Andy? His name is Andy Greenberg, and he's a writer for Wired magazine now. We called him up. And he said, don't be mistaken. These mills are really significant. They make it easy to make untraceable gun parts. Those parts are made of metal, not plastic. And as an experiment, Andy even tried to do this himself.

ANDY GREENBERG: And so it sounds almost like an infomercial. But that is the result of the experiment. It works very easily. It was a piece of cake. It did create a durable, metal lower receiver for a semi-automatic rifle and had no serial number that nobody knew about except me. And I did it in, like, the back of - back room of Wired's office in San Francisco.

KULAS: Andy started writing about Cody, assuming that lawmakers would freak out when they heard about this guy. Legislation would be passed to ban ghost guns. I mean, he really believed that was going to happen. California does have a ban on the books that will take effect later this year. And Cody has gotten the attention of a handful of other lawmakers. But aside from that, largely nothing has changed.

KING: Anyway, Cody and I stayed at the shooting range until just about sunset. And then this guy rolled up in a golf cart.

So I'm holding a weapon. Who is this?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: You got two minutes left.

WILSON: Two minutes?

KING: Two minutes left?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: 17:30 - final ceasefire.

WILSON: Thank you, sir.

KING: 17:30 - final ceasefire. Thank you, sir.

So I ask Cody, hey, can I take your picture? And he says, yeah. Of course. And he picks up one of the rifles. And I put my camera phone at him. And he, like, deliberately makes this really mean, angry face.

You don't even look like Cody that I've come to know today. You look like a gunman. You look like a gunman. You look like an actual gunman.

WILSON: Yeah. I'm the guy that helps you make the guns. I'm the gun man.

KING: Elizabeth, he was totally performing. And I wanted to say that. I wanted to say, you are performing. But I knew that he'd turn it on me, and he'd say, well, you know what? You're performing, too. And then, Cody being Cody, it would turn into this whole philosophical fight. And to be honest, the place was closing, and I was tired. So I let it go. I helped him put the guns back in the car. And we left.

He's a 29 year old punk pulling a prank or he's a hero of the First Amendment
What's what's the status of this this puppy here? It's this gun chute this thing loaded
Oh that thing a danger to either one of us. Well, it is a gun you see Cody is hard to pin down
What I do know is that he doesn't like
Regulations or government or the state he does like guns. You don't admire this as a work of art
I mean, I saw the way you held it you held it like
Well, like with a little measure of disgust, but no not disgust
My dad always said hold it and wave from you so you don't shoot your damn self
You know what fair enough Cody and I are going to best of the West which is a shooting range outside of Austin, Texas
We're running late and the sun's getting lower. And so we pull in in a rush
They're gonna close in like an hour 15. I'm just gonna say something to him
I'll wait here. So he goes to check us in and he gets our tactical bay booked and then he gives me orange earplugs
Cody does not look dangerous. He has dark hair and dark eyes and a little dimple in his chin
He's got a baby face
He also makes eye contact like maybe someone has spoken to him about the importance of making eye contact
So anyway, he lays the guns out on the table and these are mostly guns that he has made
This is a Glock
This is an M1911 single-stack 45
This is a standard military configured Colt AR-15
If you know guns, you know the AR-15 and if you don't know guns, this is the one you've seen a bunch on TV
AR-15 rifles and AR style rifles were used at the movie theater shooting in Colorado and the concert shooting in Las Vegas
And others are you gonna let me shoot the AR-15 or no? Absolutely. If you want to shoot it, you can shoot it. I
I
Don't have any particular love for guns as objects
I don't have any particular revulsion for them either unless they're used to kill or to hurt people
My father owned guns and I don't know if I want to shoot that AR-15
But at the same time I don't want Cody to think that I'm scared to shoot it
So you're leaning back a bit just kind of get that foot forward and come forward into it a bit
Find your cheek weld
Cheek well you comfortable with that?
Yeah, I like that I like that, okay
All right
Let me put you on fire and you want it if you want to do it with your own thumb you can
So bring your thumb up and just pull that down pull that down. You can fire at will
Hell's bells
After only like three three rounds with it. You look like a natural, you know
Maybe I'm just one of those people or do you think everyone's just one of those?
I have a sneaking suspicion. We're all one of those people
Yeah, okay
Cody Wilson is a gun maker
But he's never sold a gun and he's never killed anyone and as far as he knows none of the guns
He's made have ever killed anyone. So why do people think Cody Wilson is so dangerous?
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Noelle King and I'm Elizabeth Kulas
People think Cody Wilson is dangerous not because he makes guns
But because he's made a way for anyone to make their own gun
I mean that world that he's made guns don't need to move from person to person in a store
Instead they've hacked together using information. That's free and easy to find on the internet
Yeah, these are guns that can go viral and potentially make gun control impossible

Elizabeth Noel, I think we all know someone a little bit like Cody Wilson
He's the kind of person who takes a good idea like free speech and then he runs with it and he runs with it
So far that it starts to make people nervous
He really likes shocking people and his main idea is freedom
Every decision in Cody's life comes down to does this make me more free
He's the kind of guy who reads Nietzsche and he talks about anarchy and you're thinking
Have you thought this through because anarchy actually seems kind of terrible
Cody calls himself a crypto
Anarchist it is not clear though if this group actually wants to claim him back
There's a reason why Cody wants to align himself with this group. It's because they have a lot in common
Crypto anarchists believe that the anonymity of the Internet is going to bring about anarchy
It's a world that they want to see but it's also a world that they think is inevitable a world that's coming
we're at a point now where the Internet allows you to evade censorship and taxes and laws and
So they figure why would anybody follow the rules and you know
A lot of these guys live in their heads and then they get out of high school or college and like they calm down
You know, they go off to law school that is exactly what Cody Wilson did
He went to law school, but then he realized he hated law school
I felt fully superfluous in law school and I felt like a complete waste of my time
and I was going to school with like tradesmen more than
You know inquirers and not to insult them. Of course, of course, but Cody wanted to change the world
He just had to figure out something
world changing
So one day he's on the phone with a college buddy
They used to spitball all the time about ways that they could raise mischief and his friend says
What if we made a gun and at first Cody's like well
Everybody makes guns. That's that's nothing special. That's nothing new. You're not doing anything there. You're just becoming, you know
Another tradesman, you know, but then his friend says no no listen
I just remember him saying what you know, what about 3d printing how we could we could 3d print a gun?
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on. Hang on
It was just like that. I have no prior experience at 3d printing
I think I'd heard of it in passing like maybe other people had at the time, but it was that low-key
Hey Cody we could 3d print a gun
Yeah, it was about you know a couple minutes into that I'm like if that is possible. That's one of the most exciting things actually
That had ever occurred to me in
2012 low-cost 3d printers are taking off
Cody describes the 3d printer that he was gonna use like an elevated hot glue gun
It takes softened plastic and using digital blueprints
It piles layer upon layer of plastic into whatever shape you want 3d printers
Aren't just getting cheaper. They're also getting smaller. They have these ones that you can fit on your kitchen table
So people are using them at home and they're making simple solid objects like toys and figurines
But as far as Cody can tell no one's ever used a 3d printer to make a gun and then made the blueprints
Public if you can pull this off people won't have to go into a gun store and stand at a counter to buy a gun
He'll put a digital blueprint online for free and then anyone can take it and improve on it and 3d print
Their own gun. He does a little bit of research and he figures that to lease a high-grade
3d printer and to hire an engineer he needs about
$20,000 so he starts a campaign on a crowdfunding site
He makes a video and he's sitting there in like a peach colored church shirt looking about 14 years old and talking about his
Idea for a wiki weapon the product isn't our emphasis here. What we're interested in producing is a digital file
the file itself
To be shared across the internet, let me explain what Cody's saying here is I'm not interested in making and selling actual
Physical guns I'm interested in the free exchange of ideas a lot of people watch the video
But no one is really giving him any money. He gets a handful of calls
There's one dude from West Texas who gets in touch and says hey, this is a great project
I'd like to help told me he was a multi-millionaire in West Texas and he had a big oil company
I checked out and checked it out. I checked out
He had an oil company the guy had helped finance some scientific stuff. I mean it all checked out
I was like, wow, he's rich. He's curious. He's kind of mad kind of mad cat, you know
He's willing to give a kid a chance. Oh and he got me. He was it was the first guy to get me
I had never been
Catfished by the insane before this gentleman apparently really just wanted to talk on the phone
So in three weeks Cody had only raised a couple thousand dollars and the needle was stuck
And then the crowdfunding site suspends him
They're like, hey, we're the platform where you come to fundraise for like a smart toothbrush
Not a gun at the same time though. Cody gets a break a reporter from Forbes magazine
He's about what he's planning calls him up and asks like are you for real and Cody's like, yeah
I sure am so he gets a profile in Forbes first line of the article
Cody Wilson has a simple dream
Cody Wilson has a simple dream and after that the money comes pouring in it's just a handful of people
But they are people who are really behind him
He raises almost $20,000 and he can finally lease a 3d printer a beautiful 3d printer
By the way, the delivery truck rolls up and and the back door opens
They lifted it down on a pallet and I tore it down off the pallet beside my apartment complex like in
West campus he'd gotten his printer
But then a couple days later he gets an email from the printer company's lawyers and the email says basically
Hey kid, we heard about you. You're trying to use our printer to make a gun
We will be picking it up from your apartment tomorrow
Well, I hadn't made a lot of progress. I hadn't unboxed most of it. In fact, it was still in the box
Uh-huh. Yeah, I'd only had it for a few days a couple days tops
I think they came into my house. They took the boxes out
They put them on the truck on the liftgate and I watched it go
So his printer is now gone, but rather than back down he gets defiant
Now he needs to do this because not doing it would be losing
He figures by now no one else is gonna sell him or lease him a printer, but he has a backup plan
He knows a small 3d printing shop in Austin and the owners a game
There were a couple of dudes in a machine shop and on st. Elmo in Austin, Texas
They wanted to have some fun. Cody does scale back his ambitions a little bit
He decides he doesn't need these guys to 3d print him an entire gun
The engineering part of this is actually really difficult
So he's just gonna have them print a single gun part
Because there was a gun part a single gun part that had already been printed with a 3d printer
Another gunsmith had done it. He put those blueprints online. It was the lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle
The lower receiver is the part that makes the gun a gun. It's the foundation
It houses the magazine with the rounds and the firing mechanism
The receiver is also the part of the gun where you have the serial number
It's the part of the gun that you need a background check to buy
So if you can 3d print one of these things you're making a gun part without needing a background check that has no
Serial number and that can be turned into an untraceable gun
So Cody hands over the digital blueprints to the company and they call him the next morning
They ushered me into the back room. They said look it's ready
It was finished for you
We lifted the printer head and bay open and we took it out separate it from the from the plate and it was beautiful
And there was this this sheen on it this kind of
Material that needs to be removed from it
It's kind of like we call it like the afterbirth of it like this beautiful stuff that needs to be removed
They cleaned it up for me
Literally like it had been born, you know, and they I put it in my gun case and we just admired it
Felt full of purpose. I felt I felt powerful even I brought it to my car immediately after that
I put it in the passenger seat of my car and he drove straight to the house of a machinist
He knew outside of Austin and when he got there the Sun was setting and there were all of these people all of these gun
Enthusiasts who'd heard about what this kid was trying to pull off
So he takes the receiver out of the case and he passes it around, you know, it was green
It was fleshy. It was strange even though the seasoned gun guys were like wow, you know
It's it's not comparable to much
They had a big potluck dinner to celebrate Cody slept on the floor that night and the next morning
He and the machinist drove out to the machinist's shop
the machinist took out the 3d printed lower receiver adds the other parts and
They had an AR 15. The question now was though. Did they have a working AR 15?
So they drive out to the hill country to find out and of course Cody takes a video of all this and puts
It up online. I I post it up on a steel target. I
had my glasses on and
I squeezed a shot and
Felt the gun kind of pulse in my shoulders, but I looked down and it had survived
I don't know. It was probably the greatest day of my life
He'd done it it had worked
He had printed a gun part a crucial gun part from blueprints that he could now share with anyone online
It wasn't a whole gun, which is what he wanted. But this was a big step forward
Remember Cody was still a law student and about a month after he shot that video
He was in a big lecture hall about to sit an exam and he's taking his stuff out of his bag and his phone
Pings and there is a text from Andy the reporter who profiled him in Forbes and the text says
Does this change your project? Does this change what you're going to do? I
Don't know what he means
So he puts it out of his mind until the exam is over and a couple hours later
He gets out into the hallway and he's making his way down a hill to his car
Andy sent me another text during exam. He said it just said Newtown, Connecticut. That's the only thing he said
So I googled Newtown, Connecticut and I found I found exactly what had happened and
I
Won't lie to you. I I thought
Okay, I'm ahead of this
That's what I thought
What do you mean? I'm ahead of this
I
Knew immediate like this was gonna be a big one
this was gonna be the next four or five months are gonna be about American gun control and
The attempted bills the bills in the house bills in the Senate the president's efforts, you know
We were gonna start selling and campaigning on gun control. I just knew that that engine was starting up
I I knew it there are people who are gonna want to know why your first thought wasn't a bunch of small children
Have been shot and killed in a school. I
I'm trying to understand a thought process that goes directly to
I'm out in front of this instead of oh my god
The thing I the thing that I cared about
Was that I had a project I had a duty to fidelity to the truth of that product like I was going to make it
happen and
This in my mind upped it up the Annie
But as well I began to see in the next in the next few days and weeks
I began to see that people began to take a passionate interest in my project not oh
This is cool. This is curious. What a cool new tech idea people began to think
And and to say you must win you must do it they're going to take this stuff away from us
So we went from being a kind of curiosity on the Internet to people to people needing us
Saying that they needed us to win and to do this. It's about the politics first for me
I need to just jump in and ask you
Do you have an emotional human response to the death of children small children in a classroom?
With a gun do I I'm trying to understand if you are feeling anything about that
I know this matters like I like in a sense
I'm a casual I'm a social casualty of a climate of persistent, you know, like mass shootings and stuff
I mean, it's not the first thought you have sadly is that okay. Yeah, there's another shooting
Babies babies murder. I get that okay, but do you feel it? I get it and and feel it
I understand that it is bad, but I'm already in a in a place like an activist mentality
What is going to be done with this event?
How is this going to be used? How is this going to be used against me?
Look, I mean that's that's where I am
Okay, obviously Cody and I were not gonna see this the same way, but Elizabeth you heard what he was saying there
He was saying we were afraid that the government was gonna come and take our guns away
He was not the only person thinking that the truth is we know that after mass shootings gun sales tend to go up
But after Newtown their fears didn't really come true
This country didn't pass any really significant national gun control laws
But something else did happen here something that was big in Cody's world
The community that he belonged to those makers the people playing around with 3d printers online
They turned on him and people like him
They started pulling off their websites anything that had to do with 3d printing weapons and guns
this
Infuriated Cody he was like screw him. He doubles down makes his own website
He takes all those blueprints and digital files that are being dumped and he puts them back online
So he's raising the stakes here and then he raises them to a point where they can't get much higher
Remember he was still determined to 3d print an entire working gun and after a couple months
He did it this little pistol called the Liberator. It worked. It was a real working 3d printed gun
He takes the Liberator blueprints and he puts them on his website and in the next two days
100,000 people from all over the world
Download them 24 hours after that Cody gets a letter from the US State Department and for something written in legalese
It is very clear that he is in enormous trouble. The letter said Cody may be in violation of something called ITAR
ITAR the international traffic in arms regulation
ITAR is a set of regulations that controls the export of munitions of weapons from the US to any other country
And there are lots of rules about which weapons can be sent outside of the US and and where they can be sent and the
State Department's letter to Cody says look when you uploaded those blueprints to the internet you exported weapons overseas
Each download to a foreign person was a violation. We're talking about hundreds of thousands of violations
Hundreds of thousands of violations that you personally are responsible for it's basically like being being a gun runner on the internet or something
I mean his website didn't just have the blueprints for his 3d printed pistol. There were blueprints for other guns
There were blueprints for an anti aircraft warhead, but he's not exporting actual guns or weapons, right?
Yeah, and this is where it gets complicated
ITAR controls distribution of hardware software and technical data
The State Department is saying these digital blueprints count as technical data. Okay, so what he's doing really is against us law
I mean it really depends the State Department says look you didn't get a license to upload this content
And that is the rule with exports you want to export something you need approval
Well, he didn't ask for approval so, okay
But if you follow the State Department's rules to the letter you can see that they're very very restrictive
I mean they can basically classify anything they want as technical data
And yet at the same time legally ITAR cannot be used to restrict free speech
There's legal precedent for that and we have an example of just how tricky this can get. Yes, Elizabeth
You are an Australian citizen. I am you are okay. And so let's say right here in studio
I'm gonna tell you how to make a very simple pistol step one step two step three bang
Here's how you do it Cody's lawyer who of course is on Cody's side
He says if you interpret ITAR strictly, I've just exported a gun to Australia illegally. Yes illegally illegally
I could get in trouble and this is what Cody was facing
He could be in trouble
The thing is whether you like Cody or not you have to imagine a world where the government gets to decide that I can't
Tell you Elizabeth certain things because that is technically exporting munitions
And that feels a whole lot like restricting free speech. Yes, and it did to Cody too. He did take his website down
He was facing 20 years in prison and a million dollar fine for each foreign download
But the word got out and there are a lot of lawyers out there who are really
Interested in not restricting the First Amendment and also a lot of lawyers who are interested in the complexities of ITAR
So Cody hires some of them and he sues the State Department and his legal strategy is this the stuff
He put online the digital blueprints. That's not technical data. That is speech
Some of the top lawyers in the country are now working for Cody
His case has been kicked around the lower courts in Texas
He and his lawyers actually tried to get the Supreme Court to hear it and recently found out that the Supreme Court will not
So it's going back to a lower court in Texas
But you know Cody points out the genie is already out of this bottle 3d printed guns are real they're happening now and
In many ways, it doesn't really matter what the government says the whole conversation had been fixed since the late 80s
About what American gun control was always gonna look like and how we were gonna through gradualism kind of get
I don't know some consensus place and in a sense that argument is still repeated every day when there's a mass shooting
Okay, this balance between well, we got to control things and you know
This kind of person can buy a gun this kind of person can't but of course that's all exploded in a in a world where you can
Just download whatever gun you want
Which is the world you want?
That's the world of made after the break how you take a dangerous idea and make it even more dangerous

I've been talking to Cody for a few weeks about what he's doing now
He is still taking good ideas like free speech and then taking them very very far
His latest project is a crowdfunding platform called hatred on it lets people donate money to personalities including white
Supremacists like Andrew Englund and Richard Spencer who have been kicked off other platforms. He's giving them a home and
He is also in manufacturing now. So here's what he's doing. The government pulled him offline. Yes
So he started manufacturing gun mills
This is hardware computer controlled mills a mill is a black steel box is very heavy
It's about a foot by a foot and inside of it is a drill a cutter that can move in three dimensions
It can make ar-15 lower receivers with no serial number gun control advocates call these ghost guns
So Cody is kind of a middle finger calls his mill the ghost gunner
It can also take a metal frame like a pistol frame and make it into a weapon
Which Cody actually showed me it comes in a pistol frame and comes out a legal firearm
Cody's company has sold about four thousand five hundred of these mills
They go for around
$1,700 and I think it's tempting to look at them and think well, that's not as big a deal as 3d printing, right?
It's just a mill but you know that reporter that Cody was talking about Andy
His name is Andy Greenberg and he's a writer for Wired magazine now
We called him up and he said don't be mistaken. These mills are really significant
They make it easy to make untraceable gun parts. Those parts are made of metal not plastic
And as an experiment Andy even tried to do this himself
I'm sorry. This sounds like almost like an infomercial, but this is actually the results of the experiment
It works very easily. It was it was a piece of cake
It did create a durable metal lower receiver for a semi-automatic rifle that had no serial number that
Nobody knew about except me and I did in like the back of that room of Wired's office in San Francisco
Andy started writing about Cody assuming that lawmakers would freak out when they heard about this guy
Legislation would be passed to ban ghost guns. I mean he really believed that was gonna happen
California does have a ban on the books that will take effect later this year
And Cody has gotten the attention of a handful of other lawmakers
But aside from that largely nothing has changed
Anyway, Cody and I stayed at the shooting range until just about sunset and then this guy rolled up in a golf cart
So I'm holding a weapon
Two minutes left
1730 final ceasefire. Thank you, sir. So I asked Cody
Hey, can I take your picture and he says yeah, of course
And he he picks up one of the rifles and I point my camera phone at him and he like
Deliberately makes this really mean angry face. You don't even look like Cody that I've come to know today
You look like a gunman. You look like a gunman. You look like an actual gunman. Yeah
I'm the guy that helps you make the guns. I'm the gunman Elizabeth
He was totally performing and I wanted to say that I wanted to say you are performing
But I knew that he'd turn it on me and he'd say well
You know what? You're performing too
And then you're Cody being Cody it would turn into this whole philosophical fight and to be honest
The place was closing and I was tired. So I let it go
I helped him put the guns back in the car and we left
