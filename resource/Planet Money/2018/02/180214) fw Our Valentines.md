If you can't beat 'em, send 'em a valentine.

Journalists are a jealous bunch. We steal each other's stories, and sources. And when someone writes a story that we're envious of, we usually curse them under our breath, and move on. But once a year at Planet Money, we give a shout out to our favorite work.

This year, our Valentines go out to:
824: Our Valentines

-Eric Konigsberg, for finding out what people do all day at WeWork 'coworking' spaces in his awesomely-titled article, "Sriracha Is for Closers."

-Mike Mariani, who manages to make a 39-page magazine article read like a novel.

-Samir Madani, who transformed the world of oil...with a hashtag.

-Farm Show Magazine, for teaching us that elevated buses make great deer stands, and other nuggets of wisdom us urbanites will likely never use.

-The Masterpiece Theater television show, "Victoria," for depicting corn laws with all the drama they deserve.

-NPR's Video Team, for making the amazing new video series, "Planet Money Shorts." Watch the first episode, "Chicken Tax."

If you, too, have boisterous co-workers, you can listen to "Loon Calls in the Great Outdoors" here.

Music: "Be Mine" and "Funk Brothers"

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

We had this great idea for an episode a few months back - a super clever way to deal with this problem that we had. Our corporate bosses at NPR decided that they were going to rehab our space - wreck everything down, take everything out, pull up the carpets. It was extremely loud.

(SOUNDBITE OF CARPET RIPPING)

SMITH: Oh, no. Everything's gone - the chairs, the desks.

For a week, the PLANET MONEY team rented a temporary office at a WeWork. This is one of those co-working spaces that feel like a cross between a boutique hotel and a student center at a college.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAFT PUNK SONG, "SOMETHING ABOUT US")

SMITH: Is this lounge funk playing everywhere?

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yes - not inside the offices but in all the common spaces, yes.

SMITH: OK - hard for radio.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Good for dancing.

SMITH: Oh, but there was free beer. There was a roof deck, a party deck. There was bagel time. And we thought we might do an entire show on WeWork and the strange experience there. But then Esquire magazine came out with their article on WeWork entitled - and I'm so jealous of this title - "Sriracha Is For Closers." It was essentially the same story that we wanted to tell about the people who inhabit this world of WeWork, but if I'm being honest with myself, it was better. Just listen to this line from the story's writer, Eric Konigsberg. (Reading) What might Willy Loman, who ventured door to door with nothing but a smile and a shoeshine, have made of WeWork's buy-in incubator program with its build-your-own-hash-brown bar on Thank God It's Mondays?

I mean, come on. As a journalist, what are you supposed to do when somebody kicks your butt like this? Well, here on PLANET MONEY, you write them a valentine.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith. Today on the show, we bring you our annual Valentine's Day episode - a yearly tradition where we express our love and, yes, our jealousy for the things that we wish we had thought of. We'll have members the PLANET MONEY team come on and share their favorite Twitter accounts, TV shows, articles and even the blissful sounds of nature.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: The other day we were having our regular staff meeting here at PLANET MONEY, and Noel King, who is - who is normally pretty quiet in a corporate meeting - hey, Noel.

NOEL KING, BYLINE: Hey, Robert.

SMITH: Noel was on fire talking about this article that you had read that you just loved. And I said, listen, just come on in here and just tell us about it for our Valentine's show.

KING: Yeah. It's called "Promethea Unbound." And it was in The Atavist Magazine. It was written by a man named Mike Mariani. And I'm going to tell you what I love about this story. I'm going to keep it really short.

SMITH: OK.

KING: It starts out in a way that you've seen a hundred other news stories start out, right? It's this single mother. She's very poor. She's living out of a van with her 5-year-old daughter. They have no money. They're sleeping in parking lots. They're washing their hair in fountains at night. And the mom is trying to not let on to her 5-year-old that this is not a normal way to live, right? This is like - they're in dire straits.

So she's keeping her entertained. You know, the kid's not enrolled in school, but she takes her to the park. She takes her - you know, like, little educational things. And very early on in this story, you learn that the mom is planning this surprise trip for her 5-year-old, and she's trying to keep it a secret. She's, like, driving the van, and you don't know where they're going.

SMITH: Thinking Disneyland or something.

KING: Yeah, like they're going to Disney World, they're going someplace a 5-year-old would love. And it turns out that they are driving to Stanford University, and then you learn that they're driving to Stanford University's linear accelerator, which is a top science lab. And you're confused now because you're like, a homeless mom and 5-year-old daughter - what is going on here? And they're there. They're at Stanford to take a tour of the linear accelerator. And you're like, what? Is there a kid's program or something? But no, no. The tour is - it's college professors and college students, you know, people who are really interested in, like, physics.

And so they finish the tour, and the professor who's leading it says, does anyone have any questions? And the 5-year-old girl raises her hand, and she says this, like, really, seriously adult question about particles colliding and why the accelerator doesn't overheat. And you're like, what is going on in this story? And then it unspools. This little girl, this 5-year-old girl, is a genius.

SMITH: Now, I don't want to spoil the end of this story, but I wanted to ask you as someone who is a reporter and tells stories for a living, what is it about the structure of this story that grabbed you, that basically made you want to steal it for a future podcast?

KING: (Laughter) Well, in journalism, we're always finding, you know, one person who represents - who's the everyman, who represents everybody.

SMITH: Especially when we're talking about poverty.

KING: That's right. What you have in this case is a character who is so singular, who almost seems like she must be made up. She must be fiction. It's like you're reading this story and you feel like you're reading a novel because the character is so far from a cutout. She is so extraordinary. And I think if you can write a 39-page magazine article (laughter) that reads like a novel - Mike Mariani, hats off to you. It's great.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: The name of the story is "Promethea Unbound," and you can find it at The Atavist - atavist.com. Thanks, Noel.

KING: Thank you, Robert.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: One of our newest reporters here, Julia Simon, has a secret nerdy passion.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: That's true.

SMITH: Reveal what it is.

SIMON: My valentine goes out to Samir Madani, this guy who spends every night tweeting where oil tankers are around the world.

SMITH: Like, tweeting out the location of oil tankers - it's like trainspotting for oil tankers.

SIMON: Exactly. He's made this group of people all around the world who are tweeting with him, and they're called the Organization of Oil Trading Tweeters.

SMITH: This is not an official organization.

SIMON: It is not an official organization. It is modeled after an official organization OPEC - the Organization of Petroleum Exporting...

SMITH: Get it, yeah.

SIMON: Yeah, yeah, we get it. But this hashtag and this group has transformed the world of oil.

SMITH: We should say that you have extensive experience in doing stories about oil, so it's not just a random interest.

SIMON: It's not totally random, but I also just love the high seas, and they're not seas. They're the high seas.

SMITH: The high seas - yeah, you never hit the low seas, right?

SIMON: No.

SMITH: That's such a weird thing. I'm going to look at the hashtag #OOTT on Twitter. Oh, this is - this is a real thing.

SIMON: It is.

SMITH: One of the first ones that comes up is (reading) standoff in the high seas as Cyprus says Turkey blocks gas drill ship, hashtag #OOTT.

SIMON: Yep, this is the type of drama.

SMITH: Drama, yeah. So this guy Samir Madani, why does he do this? Is this his job?

SIMON: No, this isn't his job. He's a technology executive. And every night, he goes online, and this is his entertainment. He uses satellites and reports, and he looks at tankers all around the world, and he sees some pretty crazy stuff.

SAMIR MADANI: These shenanigans out at sea are very interesting. So, for instance, some transfers will happen in a clandestine manner. They'll switch off their AIS transponder, and it tranfers oil by by hoses.

SIMON: They're transferring oil using hoses from one ship to another.

MADANI: Yeah, out at sea.

SIMON: I mean, you're watching this stuff unfolding. It's so exciting. Like, you really don't need Netflix in your life, do you?

MADANI: (Laughter) No, they should be paying me to watch this stuff.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: So we just did our PLANET MONEY space series where we talked to a lot of people who use satellites and various other spy means to essentially do the same thing, to track ships around the world. And the idea is there are commodities traders who can make a lot of money if they figure out that there is too much oil in this place and not enough oil in that place and there's oil headed between them. So I understand the greed part of this, but I don't understand why would you just do this for free.

SIMON: Yeah. I mean, he just - he's an oil nerd. There are a lot of other oil nerds all around the world. They're sitting there. They're totally lonely until Samir comes around with this hashtag. Now, they can talk to each other and share this information.

SMITH: It's like a club.

SIMON: It's a club. And in this club, sometimes pirates show up.

SMITH: Oh, and I bet they go crazy. Thank you, Julia.

SIMON: Thank you, Robert.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOSSELIN BORDAT AND LE FAT CLUB'S "BEYOND STYLE")

SMITH: With us now is the editor of PLANET MONEY, Bryant Urstadt.

Hey, Bryant.

BRYANT URSTADT, BYLINE: Hi, Robert.

SMITH: We should say, before you give your valentine, where did you grow up?

URSTADT: I grew up in New York City.

SMITH: On the Upper East Side.

URSTADT: Yes.

SMITH: You are a city boy through and through.

URSTADT: Yes.

SMITH: And your valentine goes to...

URSTADT: Farm Show magazine.

SMITH: (Laughter) OK. Describe this thing to me because you have this little, tiny, tiny magazine about the size of the palm of your hand called Farm Show magazine.

URSTADT: So Farm Show magazine is printed on newsprint, as you can smell.

SMITH: (Laughter) Yes.

URSTADT: And Farm Show magazine basically rounds up tips and tricks from what they call farm shop wizards or farmers all over the country. And they basically just write in and tell people what they've done. And often it's projects they've spent months working on. And often it's solving problems that bother all kinds of farmers.

SMITH: So...

URSTADT: And...

SMITH: ...Give me an example.

URSTADT: Engine-powered gopher-killing machines.

SMITH: OK (laughter).

URSTADT: Mini electric fence keeps mice out of stored machines.

SMITH: Wait - it's a tiny little electric fence?

URSTADT: They're - well, you can see. Yeah, they're tiny little electric fence. It runs around the perimeter.

SMITH: OK.

URSTADT: Texas ranch makes money raising butterflies.

SMITH: (Laughter).

URSTADT: And my new favorite - elevated bus makes great deer stand.

SMITH: Now, a deer stand, for those of you who live in a city, is a place where you shoot deer from.

URSTADT: When you're hunting deer, you're basically waiting for them to show up.

SMITH: Sure.

URSTADT: And it can take a long time. And a lot of people do it on a little ladder in a tree. But this farmer has decided to do it in a school bus which he has mounted, as you can see here, on a 28-foot-high gas tank.

SMITH: (Laughter) So imagine a yellow school bus essentially up in the air. What does it look - like, 10, 20 feet up?

URSTADT: It looks like a flying school bus, which it basically is.

SMITH: (Laughter) And he shows that he's made the inside - there's a little table and a little place where he can sleep. And is that like a microwave oven so he can cook?

URSTADT: Sure.

SMITH: Yeah (laughter). Why? You can never, ever, ever, where you live now in suburban Connecticut, use any of these tips. Why do you read this?

URSTADT: I sit at my desk all day, and I dream of solving problems that don't require a keyboard. And this magazine is just filled with people usually who are probably living pretty far from one another who want to communicate with each other, who actually have solved problems. And there probably is someone else out there wondering how exactly to get his school bus up on a 28-foot gas tank. And the instructions are inside. And I just want to be a part of that world, even if it's only watching it.

SMITH: Farm Show magazine - that's out of Lakeville, Minn.

Thanks, Bryant.

URSTADT: You're welcome.

(SOUNDBITE OF PIERRE DUBOST AND JEROME FABY'S "BUBBLE GROOVE")

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hello. I bring you my valentine.

SMITH: Stacey Vanek Smith visiting from The Indicator.

How are you doing?

VANEK SMITH: I'm doing well. So my valentine is to a television show that I really love called "Victoria." It is about Queen Victoria. It is part of "Masterpiece Theatre." And...

SMITH: No need to be embarrassed.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) I am a little embarrassed. Anyway, though - so I kind of - I watch the show to, you know, get away from work. It's this sort of lovely escapist drama. It's very well done incidentally. But I was watching it the other day, and there was this whole plotline, and it reminded me of work so much I could not believe it. The scene takes place in the British Parliament.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "VICTORIA")

NIGEL LINDSAY: (As Sir Robert Peel) We must be ready for the season when famine comes again by abolishing the Corn Laws.

SMITH: The Corn Laws.

VANEK SMITH: The Corn Laws.

SMITH: You rewound it. And you're like, I can't believe that they're talking about one of the sort of fundamental historical moments in free trade.

VANEK SMITH: Yes. Exactly. The Corn Laws were tariffs that were put in place to protect the sort of landowner gentry class. And they basically made it impossible - really, really, really expensive - to import grain from other countries.

SMITH: Which made food very expensive in the U.K. We're talking in the 1800s.

VANEK SMITH: Yes. And this became a huge problem during the Irish Potato Famine. The Irish potato crops very famously failed. The Irish had nothing to eat. People were starving in record numbers. It was horrible. Meanwhile, these laws meant that importing grain to send to the Irish people to save them from starving was almost impossible. And so the prime minister at the time - this man Sir Robert Peel gives this big, impassioned plea about repealing the Corn Laws and essentially moving towards free trade.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "VICTORIA")

LINDSAY: (As Sir Robert Peel) I speak for the workers of this country who may not have votes but who deserve, nonetheless, to buy untaxed food. Mr. Speaker, I commend this bill to the house.

VANEK SMITH: You know, we talk about free trade at PLANET MONEY all the time. This is a big topic, came up in the presidential election - you know, tariffs, free trade, all this stuff. But it was amazing to just watch it and see it in all of its drama. They showed starving Irish peasants, and they showed people yelling at each other in Parliament. And the royal couple got in a little fight about the Corn Laws. And it was just really wonderful to see (laughter) free trade sort of dramatized in this really amazing way with such beautiful costumes - and just the passions that it aroused. For instance - I mean, I hope this isn't a spoiler. But there is this man who tries to assassinate Sir Robert Peel right after the vote passes to repeal the Corn Laws because he's a landowner, and he's so worried he's going to lose his livelihood now that grain will be able to be imported from other countries.

SMITH: And sort of bigger spoiler alert - the U.K. gets rid of the Corn Laws; embraces what David Ricardo, the great economist, called comparative advantage, which is that countries should do what they're good at, which, at the time, was making textiles and such. And it all, at least as far as grain was concerned, worked out for the best.

VANEK SMITH: Yes, exactly. Anyway, it is a great show. I don't know if I should recommend it 'cause you just have to like...

SMITH: No. No, own it.

VANEK SMITH: ...Period dramas...

SMITH: Own it.

VANEK SMITH: ...With costumes. But if you like period dramas with fussy costumes and, like, furtive glances - oh, my God, you've got to watch "Victoria."

SMITH: Stacey Vanek Smith, thank you.

VANEK SMITH: Anytime.

SMITH: After the break - now that the voices of the PLANET MONEY team are echoing in your ears, we have a solution for how to get them out.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SMITH: I'll make my valentine short. It goes out to the video team here at NPR. Yes, NPR has a video team. And they've been spending the last six months working on these amazing short videos based on episodes of PLANET MONEY. They're hilarious. The first one is about the chicken tax. It's how frozen chicken changed the market for pickup trucks around the world. And you can find these videos at npr.org/planetmoneyshorts.

And finally, one of our reporters, Kenny Malone, did not suggest a valentines (ph) - although I noticed that he is always sitting in the corner listening to something.

KENNY MALONE, BYLINE: Yeah. I'm trying to block out the sound of all of my colleagues.

SMITH: What are you listening to?

MALONE: Well, before I tell you what I'm listening to, I mean, I think it's important for listeners to know that...

SMITH: Uh-oh.

MALONE: No, no, no - that the...

SMITH: Say it. Just say it.

MALONE: ...That the NPR New York office recently underwent some renovations. We were already open concept. We became more open concept. Walls came down. More people are now in this space.

SMITH: And say what you want to say to my face.

MALONE: Robert Smith, you are a very loud person.

SMITH: (Laughter) Sorry. I'm sorry about that.

MALONE: It's OK. It's very charming. It's - the PLANET MONEY staff as a whole - and I am part of this - is - we're excitable, often a little bit loud. And so in the open space, sometimes it can be a little overwhelming.

SMITH: That would mean that each...

MALONE: For those of you listening, here is an example of what our office sounds like.

SMITH: You know, in the town of Canton, Ohio...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah.

SMITH: ...There are no dogs. And I know that sounds strange, but that's because they define the mammal with four legs and little ears as a canine. It is in the law.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: So technically, the moment a dog crosses...

MALONE: And just so you know, there are 30 people trying to work while Robert is saying, like, whatever that is.

SMITH: It's too hard to explain. But it is not true about Canton, Ohio, and dogs. Let's just move on.

MALONE: OK. So when you see me listening off in my corner with my headphones on, I'm trying to concentrate. And this is what I'm listening to.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

SMITH: Is that water?

MALONE: (Sighing) That's the sound of relaxation.

SMITH: Oh, no way.

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: This is what you're listening to?

MALONE: When I'm in my corner with my headphones on, I'm listening to loons, man.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

MALONE: Aren't you just there? Aren't you, like, staring through cattails looking out on a lake somewhere in the middle of Ontario?

SMITH: But seriously, this isn't a joke?

MALONE: No, no. This is what I have on my phone. I have at least three hours' worth of loon sounds, two different albums' worth. I tried to find it in binaural. So if any listeners have any suggestions for binaural loon sounds, I'm open to that.

SMITH: Let's just let this one play out.

MALONE: Yeah, yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

SMITH: And I'm just super, super chill right now. So if you have any thoughts on the show, email us - or don't. I mean, we're planetmoney@npr.org. We're on Facebook, Twitter.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

MALONE: Yeah.

SMITH: Show was produced today...

MALONE: Show was produced today by Nick Fountain.

SMITH: Awesome.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

SMITH: Our senior producer is Alex Goldmark. As we said, our editor - Bryant Urstadt. Oh, Indicator.

MALONE: Yeah. There's this other thing we do. It's called The Indicator...

SMITH: From PLANET MONEY.

MALONE: ...By PLANET MONEY.

SMITH: Sorry. I stepped on your...

MALONE: No, I'm sorry.

SMITH: The Indicator from PLANET MONEY?

MALONE: Of PLANET MONEY (laughter).

SMITH: You know, it's - if you need something a little more fast-paced, a little quicker, a little more on the news, it's the place to go.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone.

SMITH: Robert Smith here.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDS OF THE EARTH'S "LOON CALLS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS")

SMITH: (Sighing) Thanks for listening.

There are a lot of other oil nerds all around the world. They're sitting there
They're totally lonely until Samir comes around with this hashtag now
They can talk to each other and share this information. It's like a club
It's a club and in this club sometimes pirate show up. Ooh, and I bet they go crazy. Thank you Julia
Thank you Robert
With us now is the editor of Planet Money Bryant or stat. Hey Brad. Hi, Robert
We should say before you give your Valentine. Where did you grow up?
I grew up in New York City on the Upper East Side. Yes, you are a city boy through and through
Yes, and your Valentine goes to
farm show magazine
Did describe this thing to me because you have this little tiny tiny magazine
But the size of the palm of your hand called farm show magazine
So farm show magazine is printed on newsprint as you can smell
Yes and farm show magazine basically rounds up tips and tricks from what they call farm shop wizards or farmers all over the country and
They basically just write in and tell people what they've done and often it's projects
They've spent months working on and often it's solving problems that bother all kinds of farmers. So and give me an example
engine powered gopher killing machines
Okay, mini electric fence keeps mice out of stored machines. Wait, it's a tiny little electric fence
Well, you can see yeah, they're tiny little electric fence it runs around the perimeter, okay, Texas ranch makes money raising butterflies
and my new favorite
Elevated bus makes great deer stand
Now deer stand for those of you who live in a city is a place where you shoot deer from
When you're hunting deer you're basically waiting for them to show up and it can take a long time and a lot of
People do it on a little ladder in a tree
But this farmer has decided to do it in a school bus, which he is mounted as you can see here on a 28-foot high
gas tank
So imagine a yellow school bus
Essentially up in the air. What does it look like 1020 feet up? It looks like a flying school bus
Which it basically is and he shows that he's made the inside
There's a little table and a little place where you can sleep in is that like a microwave oven. So sure cook. Yeah
Why you can never ever ever where you live now in suburban, Connecticut use any of these tips
Why do you read this? I sit at my desk all day and I dream of
Solving problems that don't require a keyboard and this magazine is just filled with people
Usually who are probably living living pretty far from one another who want to communicate with each other who actually have solved problems
And there probably is someone else out there
wondering how exactly to get his school bus up on a 28-foot gas tank and the instructions are inside and I just
Want to be a part of that world, even if it's only watching it farm show magazine
Hello, I bring you my Valentine Stacey Vanik Smith visiting from the indicator. How are you doing?
I'm doing well
so my Valentine is to a
television show that I
Really love called Victoria. It is a bow queen Victoria. It is part of Masterpiece Theatre
No need to be embarrassed. I
Anyway, though, so I kind of watched the show to you know, get away from work. It's this sort of lovely escape
It's drama. It's very well done incidentally, but I was watching it the other day and there's there was this whole plotline and
It reminded me of work so much. I could not believe it
The scene takes place in the British Parliament. We must be ready for the season
When famine comes again by abolishing the call
The Corn Laws the corn live wound it and you're like, I can't believe it they're talking about one of the sort of
fundamental historical moments in free trade
Yes, exactly. The Corn Laws were tariffs that were put in place to protect the sort of landowner gentry class
and they
Basically made it impossible
Really really really expensive to import grain from other countries which made food very expensive in the UK
We're talking in the 1800s
Yes
And this became a huge problem during the Irish potato famine the Irish potato crops very famously failed the Irish had
Nothing to eat people were starving in record numbers. It was horrible
Meanwhile these laws meant that importing grain to send to the Irish people to save them from starving
Was almost impossible and so the Prime Minister at the time this man, Sir Robert Peel
Gives this big impassioned plea about repealing the Corn Laws and essentially moving towards free trade
I speak for the workers of this country
May not have votes, but who deserve nonetheless to buy on taxed food
Mr. Speaker I
Commend this bill to the house, you know, we talk about free trade a plan of money all the time
This is a big topic came up in the presidential election, you know tariffs free trade all this stuff
But it was amazing to just watch it and see it in all of its drama
they showed starving Irish peasants and they showed people yelling at each other in Parliament and
The royal couple got in a little fight about the Corn Laws and it was just really wonderful to see
free trade sort of dramatized in this really
Amazing way with such beautiful costumes and and just the passions that it aroused for instance
I mean, I hope this isn't a spoiler but there is this man who tries to assassinate Sir Robert Peel right after the vote
Passes to repeal the Corn Laws
Because he's a landowner and he's so worried
He's gonna lose his livelihood now that grain will be able to be imported from other countries and sort of bigger spoiler alert
The UK gets rid of the Corn Laws
Embraces what David Ricardo the great economist called comparative advantage
Which is that countries should do what they are good at which at the time was making textiles and such and it all
At least as far as grain was concerned worked out for the best. Yes, exactly
anyway, it is a
Great show. I don't know if I should recommend it because you just have to like period dramas with costumes
But if you like period dramas with fussy costumes and like furtive glances
Oh my god, you got to watch Victoria Stacey Vannick Smith

I'll make my Valentine short. It goes out to the video team here at NPR
Yes, NPR has a video team and they've been spending the last six months working on these amazing short videos based on
episodes of
Planet Money
They're hilarious. The first one is about the chicken tax
It's how frozen chicken changed the market for pickup trucks around the world and you can find these videos at
NPR dot org slash Planet Money shorts
And finally one of our reporters Katie Malone did not suggest a Valentine's
Although I noticed that he is always sitting in the corner listening to something. Yeah
I'm trying to block out the sound of all of my colleagues. What are you listening to?
Well before I tell you what I'm listening to you
I mean, I think it's important for for listeners to know that well
No, no, no that that that the say it to say that the NPR New York office recently underwent some some renovations
We were already open concept. We became more open concept walls came down
More people are now in this space and say what you want to say to my face
Robert Smith, you are a very loud person. Sorry. It's okay. It's very charming
It's the Planet Money staff as a whole and I'm part of this is we are excitable
Often a little bit loud and so in the open space
Sometimes it can be a little overwhelming
For those of you listening here is an example of what our office sounds like you know in the town of Canton, Ohio
Yeah, there are no dogs and I know that sounds strange
Strange but that's because they define the mammal with four legs and little ears as a canine it is in the law
So technically the moment a dog
And just so you know, there are 30 people trying to work while Robert is saying what like whatever that is
It's too hard to explain but it is not true about Canton, Ohio and dogs. Just let's just move on
Okay, so when you see me listening off in my corner with my headphones on I'm trying to concentrate
And
This is what I'm listening to. Is that water?
It's the sound of relaxation
This is what you're listening to when I'm in my corner with my headphones on
I'm listening to loons man. Aren't you just there? Aren't you like staring through cattails looking out on a lake?
Somewhere in the middle of Ontario, but seriously, this isn't a joke. No, no, this is this is what I have on my phone
I have at least three hours worth of loon sounds two different albums worth. I
Tried to find it in binaural. So if any listeners have any suggestions for binaural loon sounds, I'm open to that
Let's just let this one play out. Yeah
Yeah, you know, I'm just super super chill right now. So
