What do human blood, the conservative tax plan, and beer hops tell us about the world? Find out in today's episode.

Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia host the Planet Money spin-off, The Indicator. Each day, they take a number or term in the news, and tell you what it means and why it matters.

Today on Planet Money, we are bringing you three indicators, three numbers that tell us something about the world. We'll tell you what the US really sells to the world, how the conservative tax plan is maybe just what a liberal economist had always hoped for, and how craft beer blew up the hops business.

A note on sourcing: For more about the details of goods exports, we recommend the Atlas of Economic Complexity from Harvard. We also used the latest monthly release of the US international trade in goods and services report from the census bureau and the bureau of economic analysis. The figure for education exports was from Open Doors, a resource funded by the Department of State. And finally, we learned about the great hops bust from this story in The Financial Times.

Music: "Starting Out" and "Take it Back."

CARDIFF GARCIA, HOST:

I'm Cardiff Garcia.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. And we are the hosts of a new podcast from PLANET MONEY. It is called The Indicator.

GARCIA: And you can think of it as PLANET MONEY's quick take on the news - or quickish (ph)...

SMITH: Quickish, yeah.

GARCIA: ...Take anyways, yeah - six to eight minutes a day.

SMITH: In any case, we take a number or a term in the news, and we tell you a story behind it or give you an insight into it. And today on PLANET MONEY, we are bringing three indicators, three numbers that tell you something about the world around you.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: First, we're going to tell you what the U.S. really sells to the world. Second, we're going to tell you how conservative tax policy ended up being kind of, sort of what a liberal economist had been hoping for, and it's causing some mixed feelings. And then, finally, we're going to tell you how craft beer blew up the hops business.

SMITH: The big finish.

GARCIA: Indeed.

SMITH: Stick around. There will be blood.

GARCIA: Like, human blood?

CHARLES KENNY: Human blood, absolutely.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: Our first indicator is $2.2 trillion. That's about how much stuff in goods and services the U.S. sells to the rest of the world every year. That's a lot, but it's when you dig into the details that you really start to see some fascinating patterns. So to talk about it, I called up Charles Kenny. He's a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. Charles has been researching and writing about globalization for a while, but frankly, he's also just a fun dude to talk to about trade to the extent that that's possible. You could even kind of hear it in his voice how delighted he is to discuss U.S. exports.

KENNY: You know, we export machines. We export vehicles. We export chemicals. We export agricultural products. We export electronics. We export minerals. You know, just a huge range of stuff.

GARCIA: Charles is saying that our exports are tremendously varied. To get a sense of this, consider the top three categories of goods - so physical things, not services - that we export. Those are refined oil products, cars and airplanes. Put them all together, and they still only add up to about 11 percent of the value of all goods we export. And you don't have to search far down the list to start finding some surprising stuff.

KENNY: 1.4 percent of what the U.S. exports of stuff is blood. We turn out to be...

GARCIA: Blood?

KENNY: ...A world leader in blood exports.

GARCIA: Like, human blood?

KENNY: Human blood.

GARCIA: My blood, your blood?

KENNY: Absolutely. Human blood products - so plasma, for example. One reason is - a couple of reasons. One is, in Europe during the mad cow outbreaks of a few years ago, people were worried that we couldn't screen that out of blood supplies. And so a lot of blood plasma was exported from U.S. to Europe. And that sort of continued. Another is frankly that, in the United States, unlike most places, you can pay people for making donations of plasma and blood. And so there are a whole load of car accident victims in the United Kingdom and France who, you know, wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for the fact they've got U.S. blood circulating in their veins. I think it's a good news story.

GARCIA: And all this variety - the blood and the stuff Kenny mentioned - that's good because it's healthy that the country isn't really dependent on any one thing it sells abroad. But, he says, our exports themselves are dependent on something - they're dependent on imports.

KENNY: If you look at the Boeing Dreamliner, for example, the wingtips are made in Korea. Large parts of the rest of the wing are made in Japan. The landing gear is made in France. Some of the engines are made in the United Kingdom. All that comes together in, you know, Boeing's factories in Seattle, and then we export it. But if you didn't have all of those imports, Boeing couldn't make the Dreamliner, and it couldn't export it. And that would be, you know, really bad for U.S. trade.

GARCIA: Because if we were to make all of those parts in the U.S., the Dreamliner would be so expensive that it would be way harder to then export it abroad. There was one last thing Charles pointed out. Some things that we export never leave the country. So a huge U.S. export category - about $200 billion a year - is travel. So that's people from abroad who come as tourists or on business trips or students coming here to go to school. Think about it this way. For something to count as an export, someone who lives outside the U.S. just has to buy something from a business inside the U.S.

KENNY: So take somebody in Britain. They can buy their Mickey Mouse doll in the Disney store in London, and that'll count as - some of that will count as an export from the United States. Or they can come to Disneyland and buy the Mickey Mouse doll. Then not only will they buy the doll, but they'll, you know, be buying hotel and a car rental and food and so on. And all of that counts as an export, and it's a really important part of the U.S. economy.

GARCIA: Another big export tied to people coming to the U.S. - education. American universities and schools make nearly $40 billion from foreign students every year.

KENNY: It's a big one, and it's a very important one partially because most foreign students who come to the United States, you know, pay full price, right? They help support the university, providing more money for, you know, nicer sports equipment, smaller class sizes, better teachers, hopefully.

GARCIA: In other words, even though trade is about the movement of goods and services across borders, you can't separate it from the movement of people across borders.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: For a list of all the sources we used for this part of the episode - and there were a lot of them - go to npr.org/money, where we've posted links.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: Our next indicator is $1.8 trillion. And we're going to explain what that number is. But first, we have to tell you about Jared Bernstein.

SMITH: Yes, we do because Jared Bernstein is a man with a dilemma. He's a liberal economist. He worked on President Obama's economic team.

GARCIA: And he's been arguing for years that the U.S. needs more economic stimulus - so some combination of lower taxes and higher spending - to really get the economy going and, in particular, to start driving up wages for workers. Even now, he still thinks the economy can use a bit more stimulus.

SMITH: Now, in the past few months, the Republican-controlled Congress has passed a massive tax cut and also approved a big new spending bill, both of which were signed into law by a Republican president - by President Trump. And combined, these will add an estimated $1.8 trillion to our budget deficits in the next decade. That is our indicator - $1.8 trillion.

GARCIA: Now, these two bills were not sold as stimulus packages. They are definitely not Jared Bernstein's liberal stimulus dream come true. But they are going to mean lower taxes and higher spending, so they are kind of, sort of the thing he's been arguing for.

SMITH: It's not not stimulus. So the basic idea behind government stimulus is this. Say the economy's not doing as well as it could be. Sometimes the government can help the economy get back to its best self by spending more money or cutting taxes, so ordinary people themselves have more money to spend.

GARCIA: So when Jared Bernstein thinks about the Republican tax bill and the spending increases, he has to answer two questions. One, is the economy its best self right now? And two, will the tax cut and spending increases work as a stimulus?

SMITH: When Bernstein started working for the Obama administration, the answer to - is the economy its best self or could it use a stimulus? - was pretty simple.

JARED BERNSTEIN: I vividly remember us getting together in December of 2008, when the economy was really - falling off a cliff is the technical term...

SMITH: That must've been quite a meeting. Did you guys, like, bring a flask or something?

BERNSTEIN: Yeah, we needed a flask. So let me just tell you that there was absolutely not the slightest inkling of conflict in my or my colleagues' minds about the need for a deep and robust and quick-acting Keynesian stimulus.

GARCIA: But today, 10 years later, the unemployment rate is low. The economy's growing. It's adding jobs every month. And the value of stimulus then is much less clear.

BERNSTEIN: We are in the midst of a solid economy - no question. So my kind of nuance that I'm bringing to the table - and I guess it's different than a lot of my brothers and sisters in this - in the economics field right now - is that I think we can go further.

SMITH: Jared is team stimulus, and the reason is jobs. Unemployment seems low, but Jared thinks it can go lower. And that would be great for workers.

BERNSTEIN: Yes, things are good, but they can be better, especially for people who've been left behind. I mean, the only way the least advantaged people in this economy experience their share of the growth is when we get to and stay at not just full employment but chock-full employment - really tight labor markets. And that's what I'm hoping to look for.

GARCIA: When employers are desperate for workers, it is harder for them, the employers, to discriminate. Wages go up. Benefits go up. Workers just have more power. But the risk to adding too much stimulus to a good economy is real. It could cause inflation, it could drive prices up and end up hurting the very people that it's supposed to be helping.

SMITH: Still on question No. 1 - is the economy its best self right now? Jared's answer is no and he thinks stimulus could help. The hard question for him is question No. 2 - are the tax cuts and the spending increases good stimulus? Or not even are they good, just are they better than nothing? Will the benefits of these particular stimuli exceed the cost?

BERNSTEIN: Not all fiscal stimulus is created equal.

GARCIA: In the end, Jared said, he worries that the cost of the long-term tax cuts will be larger than the benefits of the short-term stimulus. If they'd come packaged together, Jared says that, overall, he would vote against that package. But it was obviously a tough call for him, and in any case, this is the stimulus we got. It just wasn't the stimulus that Jared wanted. So we'll just have to see in the next couple of years what that stimulus means for the economy and how the tax cuts play out in the years after that.

BERNSTEIN: According to some research that's of high quality - and I believe it - the combination of the tax cuts and the spending bill are going to add a little bit more than half a point to GDP growth this year and next year.

SMITH: In other words, the tax cuts combined with the spending increases will give the economy the boost that Jared thinks it needs. So far so good.

GARCIA: But Jared says there's a problem. A lot of the tax cut isn't just for the next few years, it's permanent or semi-permanent. And he says that is a bad idea because he thinks the government is going to need to raise more money in the future, not less, just in case there's another recession or just to pay Social Security and Medicare.

SMITH: So how does Jared weigh all of this?

BERNSTEIN: Yeah, the brain starts to kind of break down.

SMITH: (Laughter).

BERNSTEIN: So you are hearing an economist who is admittedly conflicted about all of this. I think what's happening right now in terms of fiscal stimulus - and part of that is the tax cut - is a welcome experiment. I think what's slated to happen starting in 2019, 2020 and going forward is fiscally reckless.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GARCIA: In the end, Jared said, he worries that the cost of the long-term tax cuts will be larger than the benefits of the short-term stimulus. If they'd come packaged together, Jared says that, overall, he would vote against that package. But it was obviously a tough call for him, and in any case, this is the stimulus we got. It just wasn't the stimulus that Jared wanted. So we'll just have to see in the next couple of years what that stimulus means for the economy and how the tax cuts play out in the years after that.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Coming up after the break - a story about the flower that powers beer.

GARCIA: Flower power?

SMITH: Flower power, I know.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: Our last indicator is one, specifically $1 per pound. That is the low price of Cascade hops. I talked about this number with Douglas MacKinnon. He is a middleman in the hops business. He connects the farmers who grow hops with the beer-makers who use it.

And what are hops?

DOUGLAS MACKINNON: Oh, gosh. Well...

SMITH: We're getting really basic.

MACKINNON: No. I used to get that question all the time, actually, about 10 or 15 years ago before craft beer became popular. I would - you know, people would ask what I do. They'd have no clue what hops were. Today, it's totally different. Today, everybody - it's kind of like a cult, a cult of hops.

SMITH: Hops are the flowers of the hop plant. They look like little cones. And they're used in making beer. They help flavor it. And craft beer lovers love hops. If you ask them, they will tell you all about it. And as the market for craft beer exploded over the last decade, the demand for hops exploded, too - until it didn't. Douglas MacKinnon has lived through the whole rise and fall of hops. He started working in the business in 1999, and things were in really bad shape back then. Farmers were struggling.

MACKINNON: It was bad. Banks were calling the industry unbankable. It looked pretty bleak.

SMITH: The industry was ruled by the big beer-makers like Coors and Bud. But then craft beer started taking off in the mid-2000's, and they started becoming a bigger force in the industry.

MACKINNON: Everything was moving so fast. It was just crazy.

SMITH: And craft beer uses way more hops than beers like Coors and Bud, about 10 times more hops. Also, craft beer makers did not just want mainstream hops. They wanted farmers to start planting special hops and a bunch of different kinds of hops to give their beer distinctive flavors.

MACKINNON: Citrus, Simcoe, Amarillo, Mosaic. Probably the most popular is Cascade. That's kind of the gateway hop (laughter)...

SMITH: (Laughter).

MACKINNON: ...Into aroma hops.

SMITH: In 2012, Douglas and his wife founded a company called 47Hops. They are middlemen. They take orders from craft brewers for, say, 5,000 pounds of Mosaic or Amarillo, and they find a farmer who will grow it. And business was great.

MACKINNON: For the first couple of years, we never had to do any salesy (ph) kind of calls. I mean, everybody was calling us. There was just so much demand and so much excitement and so much energy, I guess. It was like a ride on a rocket ship, I suppose.

SMITH: I mean, were prices going up as demand was...

MACKINNON: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I didn't even talk about prices. Yeah, prices - poof.

SMITH: The price of hops went nuts. Douglas says Cascade, the gateway hops, went from around three dollars a pound to more than seven dollars a pound on the wholesale market. Farmers could not plant it fast enough. Meanwhile, all kinds of different people were jumping into the craft beer business, calling up people like Douglas to get hooked up with some hops and brewing new beers. And farmers did what farmers do when the price of a crop goes up, they planted more and more hops. Demand just kept growing. And then, just over a year ago, something changed.

MACKINNON: We noticed that cash flow started slowing down.

SMITH: Brewers were not paying you on time?

MACKINNON: Right.

SMITH: The brewers weren't paying Douglas on time because craft beer sales were not booming like they had been. In the initial years, all these people were trying craft beer and switching over to it. And growth in the industry was crazy, it was like 20 percent a year. But then most people had tried craft beer, and the people who were going to switch over to craft beer had already switched over to craft beer. And people who were going to stick with the big beers were sticking with the big beers. And growth slowed down, from nearly 20 percent a year to about 5 percent a year. It was still growing but just a lot more slowly than everybody had prepared for.

And here's the thing - planting hops requires this huge upfront investment. And the plants take years to mature. So you can't just rip hops out and plant something else when the price goes down. So even as the craft beer market was leveling off, this huge wave of hops that had been planted during the boom had just started coming to market. And suddenly, there was a glut of hops. Douglas says the wholesale price for Cascade - the gateway hops - went from around $8 a pound to as little as a dollar a pound. Suddenly, Douglas' company was millions of dollars in debt. And he and his wife realized they were drowning.

MACKINNON: The writing was on the wall, and it was clear this was just the beginning.

SMITH: Last year, Douglas and his wife filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And Douglas says the whole industry is struggling, not that anyone's actually talking about it.

MACKINNON: It's mostly a guy-dominated industry, too. Maybe there's some kind of macho thing going on there. I don't know. But nobody wants to admit that they're having troubles publicly. But privately, everybody - that's all everybody's talking about.

SMITH: Douglas still believes in the hops industry and craft beer. He thinks everyone is just going to have to adjust to this new normal. No more crazy growth, just more of a slow and steady growth. He and his wife are adjusting their company - 47Hops - and he says they're on track to be out of bankruptcy in June.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: By the way, we learned about the great hops bust from a story in the Financial Times by Emiko Terazono. There's a link on our website.

GARCIA: Those were three indicators, three episodes of the podcast that Stacey and I host every single day.

SMITH: Every day.

GARCIA: And it's called - appropriately enough - The Indicator. And we know a lot of you are already subscribed, so thank you very much.

SMITH: Thank you.

GARCIA: And if you are not subscribed then, first of all, you're hurting our feelings.

SMITH: What is going on with you?

GARCIA: What are you waiting for? Check us out, please. We're like PLANET MONEY but we're a little bit more on the news. We're definitely shorter - six to eight minutes. And we appear every single day, so you can find us at NPR One or wherever you get your podcasts.

SMITH: The Indicator is produced by Darius Rafieyan and edited by Paddy Hirsch and Jacob Goldstein. Today's PLANET MONEY episode was produced by Sally Helm and Sindhu Gnanasambandan.

GARCIA: Also, we have a new series of videos here at PLANET MONEY that we made with NPR's awesome video team. And the latest one just came out today. It tells you the history of the price tag in about three minutes. You get to see what some of the people on the PLANET MONEY team look like - in costume. Trust me, it's hilarious. Check it out at npr.org/planetmoneyshorts. Again, that is npr.org/planetmoneyshorts.

SMITH: I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

**faster whisper:**
I'm Cardiff Garcia.
And I'm Stacey Vanick-Smith.
And we are the hosts of a new podcast from Planet Money.
It is called The Indicator.
And you can think of it as Planet Money's quick take on the news.
Or quickish take, anyways.
Quickish, yeah.
Yeah, six to eight minutes a day.
In any case, we take a number or a term in the news and we tell you a story behind
it or give you an insight into it.
And today on Planet Money, we are bringing you three indicators.
Three numbers that tell you something about the world around you.
First, we're going to tell you what the U.S. really sells to the world.
Second, we're going to tell you how conservative tax policy ended up being kind of sort of
what a liberal economist had been hoping for.
And it's causing some mixed feelings.
And then finally, we're going to tell you how craft beer blew up the hops business.
The big finish.
Indeed.
Stick around.
There will be blood.
Like human blood?
Human blood.
Absolutely.

Our first indicator is $2.2 trillion.
That's about how much stuff and goods and services the U.S. sells to the rest of
the world every year.
That's a lot, but it's when you dig into the details that you really start to
see some fascinating patterns.
So to talk about it, I called up Charles Kenny.
He's a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.
Charles has been researching and writing about globalization for a while, but frankly, he's
also just a fun dude to talk to about trade, to the extent that that's possible.
You can even kind of hear it in his voice how delighted he is to discuss U.S. exports.
We export machines.
We export vehicles.
We export chemicals.
We export agricultural products.
We export electronics.
We export minerals.
Just a huge range of stuff.
Charles is saying that our exports are tremendously varied.
To get a sense of this, consider the top three categories of goods.
So physical things, not services, that we export.
Those are refined oil products, cars, and airplanes.
Put them all together and they still only add up to about 11% of the value of all
goods we export.
You don't have to search far down the list to start finding some surprising stuff.
1.4% of what the U.S. exports of stuff is blood.
We turn out to be a world leader in blood exports.
Like human blood?
My blood?
Your blood?
Absolutely.
Human blood products.
So plasma, for example.
One reason is, a couple of reasons.
One is in Europe during the mad cow outbreaks of a few years ago, people worried
that we couldn't screen that out of blood supplies, and so a lot of blood plasma
was exported from U.S. to Europe, and that sort of continued.
Another is, frankly, that in the United States, unlike most places, you can pay people for
making donations of plasma and blood.
And so there are a whole load of car accident victims in the United Kingdom and France
who wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for the fact they've got U.S. blood circulating
in their veins.
I think it's a good news story.
And all this variety, the blood and the stuff Kenny mentioned, that's good
because it's healthy that the country isn't really dependent on any one thing it sells
abroad.
But he says our exports themselves are dependent on something.
They're dependent on imports.
If you look at the Boeing Dreamliner, for example, the wing tips are made in Korea.
Large parts of the rest of the wing are made in Japan.
The landing gear is made in France.
Some of the engines are made in the United Kingdom.
All that comes together in, you know, Boeing's factories in Seattle, and then we
export it.
But if you didn't have all of those imports, Boeing couldn't make the Dreamliner
and they couldn't export it.
And that would be really bad for U.S. trade.
Because if we were to make all of those parts in the U.S., the Dreamliner would be
so expensive that it would be way harder to then export it abroad.
There was one last thing Charles pointed out.
Some things that we export never leave the country.
So a huge U.S. export category, about two hundred billion dollars a year, is
travel.
So that's people from abroad who come as tourists or on business trips or
students coming here to go to school.
Think about it this way.
For something to count as an export, someone who lives outside the U.S.
just has to buy something from a business inside the U.S.
So take somebody in Britain.
They can buy their Mickey Mouse doll in the Disney store in London.
And that'll count as some of that will count as an export from the United
States. Or they can come to Disneyland and buy the Mickey Mouse doll.
Then not only will they buy the doll, but they'll, you know, be buying
hotel and car rental and food and so on.
And all of that counts as an export.
And it's a really important part of the U.S.
economy. Another big export tied to people coming to the U.S., education.
American universities and schools make nearly 40 billion dollars from
foreign students every year.
It's a big one and it's a very important one, partially because most
foreign students who come to the United States, you know, pay full
price, right? They help support the university, providing more money
for, you know, nicer sports equipment, smaller class sizes, better
teachers, hopefully.
In other words, even though trade is about the movement of goods
and services across borders, you can't separate it from the
movement of people across borders.
For a list of all the sources we used for this part of the
episode, and there were a lot of them, go to npr.org forward
slash money where we've posted links.
Our next indicator is one point eight trillion dollars.
And we're going to explain what that number is.
But first, we have to tell you about Jared Bernstein.
Yes, we do, because Jared Bernstein is a man with a dilemma.
He is a liberal economist who worked on President Obama's
economic team.
And he's been arguing for years that the U.S.
needs more economic stimulus.
So some combination of lower taxes and higher spending to
really get the economy going and in particular, to start
driving up wages for workers.
Even now, he still thinks the economy can use a bit more
stimulus.
Now, in the past few months, the Republican controlled
Congress has passed a massive tax cut and also approved a big
new spending bill, both of which were signed into law by
a Republican president by President Trump.
And combined, these will add an estimated one point eight
trillion dollars to our budget deficits in the next decade.
That is our indicator.
One point eight trillion dollars.
Now, these two bills were not sold as stimulus packages.
They are definitely not Jared Bernstein's liberal stimulus
dream come true.
But they are going to mean lower taxes and higher
spending.
So they are kind of sort of the thing he's been arguing
for.
It's not not stimulus.
So the basic idea behind government stimulus is this.
Say the economy is not doing as well as it could be.
Sometimes the government can help the economy get back to
its best self by spending more money or cutting taxes.
So ordinary people themselves have more money to spend.
So when Jared Bernstein thinks about the Republican tax bill
and the spending increases, he has to answer two questions.
One, is the economy its best self right now?
And two, will the tax cut and spending increases work
as a stimulus?
When Bernstein started working for the Obama
administration, the answer to is the economy its best
self or could it use a stimulus was pretty simple.
I vividly remember us getting together in December
of 2008 when the economy was really falling off a cliff,
is the technical term.
That must have been quite a meeting.
Did you guys like bring a flask or something?
Yeah, we needed a flask.
So let me just tell you that there was absolutely not
the slightest inkling of conflict in my or my
colleagues minds about the need for a deep and robust
and quick acting Keynesian stimulus.
But today, 10 years later, the unemployment rate
is low.
The economy is growing.
It's adding jobs every month.
And the value of stimulus then is much less clear.
We are in the midst of a solid economy.
No question.
So my kind of nuance that I'm bringing to the
table, and I guess it's different than a lot of my
brothers and sisters in this in the economics
field right now, is that I think we can go further.
Jared is team stimulus.
And the reason is jobs.
Unemployment seems low, but Jared thinks it can
go lower.
And that would be great for workers.
I guess things are good, but they can be better,
especially for people who've been left behind.
I mean, the only way the least advantaged people
in this economy experience their share of the
growth is when we get to and stay at not just
full employment, but chock full employment,
really tight labor markets.
And that's what I'm hoping to look for.
When employers are desperate for workers,
it is harder for them, the employers, to
discriminate.
Wages go up.
Benefits go up.
Workers just have more power.
But the risk to adding too much stimulus to a
good economy is real.
It could cause inflation.
It could drive prices up and end up hurting the
very people that it's supposed to be helping.
Still on question number one, is the economy
its best self right now?
Jared's answer is no.
And he thinks stimulus could help.
The hard question for him is question number two.
Are the tax cuts and the spending increases
good stimulus?
Or not even are they good, just are they
better than nothing?
Will the benefits of these particular stimuli
exceed the cost?
Not all fiscal stimulus is created equal.
Jared says he does like the spending increases.
Those are short term, just a couple of years.
He thinks they'll give the economy a nice boost.
The tax cuts, though, are not the kind of
tax cuts that Jared would have chosen.
He says they'll largely benefit the rich.
He cites projections showing that the
majority of their benefits will go to the
wealthiest Americans.
So they'll increase inequality.
But he says for the next couple of years,
they still might be good for the economy.
According to some research that's of high
quality, and I believe it, the combination of
the tax cuts and the spending bill are
going to add a little bit more than half a
point to GDP growth this year and next year.
In other words, the tax cuts combined with
the spending increases will give the economy
the boost that Jared thinks it needs.
So far, so good.
But Jared says there's a problem.
A lot of the tax cut isn't just for the
next few years.
It's permanent or semi-permanent.
And he says that is a bad idea because he
thinks the government is going to need to
raise more money in the future, not less,
just in case there's another recession or
just to pay Social Security and Medicare.
So how does Jared weigh all of this?
Yeah, the brain starts to kind of break down.
So you are hearing an economist who is
admittedly conflicted about all this.
I think what's happening right now in terms
of fiscal stimulus, and part of that is
is a welcome experiment.
I think what's slated to happen starting in
2019, 2020 and going forward is fiscally
reckless.
In the end, Jared said he worries that
the cost of the long-term tax cuts will be
larger than the benefits of the short-term
stimulus.
If they'd come packaged together, Jared says
that overall he would vote against that
package.
But it was obviously a tough call for him.
And in any case, this is the stimulus we got.
It just wasn't the stimulus that Jared wanted.
So we'll just have to see in the next couple
of years what that stimulus means for the
economy and how the tax cuts play out in
the years after that.
Coming up after the break, a story about
the flour that powers beer.
Flour power?
Flour power.
I know.

Our last indicator is one,
specifically one dollar per pound.
That is the low price of Cascade Hops.
I talked about this number with
Douglas McKinnon.
He is a middleman in the hops business.
He connects the farmers who grow hops
with the beer makers who use it.
And what, what are hops?
Oh, gosh.
We're getting really basic.
No, I used to get that question all the
time, actually, about 10 or 15 years ago
before craft beer became popular.
I would, you know, people would ask
what I do.
They'd have no clue what hops were.
Today, it's totally different.
Today, everybody, it's kind of like a
cult, a cult of hops.
Hops are the flowers of the hop plant.
They look like little cones and they're
used in making beer.
They help flavor it.
And craft beer lovers love hops.
If you ask them, they will tell you
all about it.
And as the market for craft beer
exploded over the last decade, the
demand for hops exploded, too,
until it didn't.
Douglas McKinnon has lived through
the whole rise and fall of hops.
He started working in the business
in 1999, and things were in really
bad shape back then.
Farmers were struggling.
It was bad. Banks were calling the
industry unbankable.
It looked pretty bleak.
The industry was ruled by the big
beer makers like Coors and Budd.
But then craft beer started taking
off in the mid 2000s, and they
started becoming a bigger force in
the industry.
Everything was moving so fast.
It was just crazy.
And craft beer uses way more hops
than beers like Coors and Budd,
about 10 times more hops.
Also, craft beer makers did not
just want mainstream hops.
They wanted farmers to start
planting special hops and a bunch
of different kinds of hops to give
their beer distinctive flavors.
Citra, Simcoe, Amarillo,
Mosaic.
Probably the most popular is
Cascade.
That's kind of the gateway
hop into Aromahops.
In 2012, Douglas and his wife
founded a company called 47 Hops.
They are middlemen.
They take orders from craft
brewers for, say, five thousand
pounds of Mosaic or Amarillo,
and they find a farmer who will
grow it. And business was great.
For the first couple of years,
we never had to do
any salesy kind of
calls. I mean, everybody was
calling us.
It was just so much demand
and so much excitement and so
much energy, I guess.
It was like a ride on a rocket
ship, I suppose.
I mean, were prices going up
as demand?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I didn't even
talk about prices.
Yeah, prices poof.
The price of hops went nuts.
Douglas says Cascade, the gateway
hops, went from around three
dollars a pound to more than
seven dollars a pound on the
wholesale market.
Farmers could not plant it fast
enough. Meanwhile, all kinds of
different people were jumping
into the craft beer business,
calling up people like Douglas
to get hooked up with some hops
and brewing new beers.
And farmers did what farmers
do when the price of a crop
goes up. They planted more and
more hops. Demand just
kept growing.
And then just over a year ago,
something changed.
We noticed that cash flow
started slowing down.
Brewers were not paying you
on time.
Right.
The brewers weren't paying
Douglas on time because craft
beer sales were not booming
like they had been.
In the initial years, all these
people were trying craft beer
and switching over to it.
And growth in the industry was
crazy. It was like 20 percent a
year.
But then most people had tried
craft beer and the people who
were going to switch over to
craft beer had already switched
over to craft beer and people
were going to stick with the
big beers or sticking with the
big beers.
And growth slowed down from
nearly 20 percent a year to
about five percent a year.
It was still growing, but just
a lot more slowly than
everybody had prepared for.
And here's the thing.
Planting hops requires this huge
upfront investment and the
plants take years to mature.
So you can't just rip hops out
and plant something else when
the price goes down.
So even as the craft beer market
was leveling off, this huge
wave of hops that had been
planted during the boom had
just started coming to market.
And suddenly there was a glut
of hops.
Douglas says the wholesale price
for Cascade, the Gateway Hops,
went from around eight dollars
a pound to as little as
a dollar a pound.
Suddenly, Douglas's company
was millions of dollars in
debt. And he and his wife
realized they were drowning.
The writing was on the wall and
it was it was clear this
was just the beginning.
Last year, Douglas and his wife
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
And Douglas says the whole
industry is struggling, not
that anyone's actually talking
about it.
It's mostly a guy dominated
industry, too.
Maybe there's some kind of
macho thing going on there.
I don't know.
But nobody wants to admit
that they're having troubles
publicly.
But privately, everybody's.
That's all everybody's talking
about.
Douglas still believes in the
hops industry and craft beer.
He thinks everyone is just
going to have to adjust to
this new normal.
No more crazy growth, just more
of a slow and steady growth.
He and his wife are adjusting
their company, 47 Hops,
and he says they're on track
to be out of bankruptcy in
June.
By the way, we learned about
the great hops bust from a
story in the Financial Times
by Emiko Terizono.
