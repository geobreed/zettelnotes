We rethink everything we know about government spending, taxes, the nature of money... All of it.

Some ideas seem too good to be true. Like this one. It comes from a 13-year-old listener named Amy. She says she knows the government has trouble finding enough money to pay for stuff like schools and hospitals. And she wondered if it has considered just printing more money. She asked us: Can the government do that? Just make more money to pay for stuff?

#866: Modern Monetary Theory

Fiscal hawks say, 'no way!' We'd have crazy inflation! But there's a group of economists that says, 'yes, we can create way more money, without disaster. And pay for lots of stuff we want.' They are the proponents of what's called Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT. Their ideas are getting out there, they have the memes to prove it.

Today, we try to understand a school of thought that is flipping economic theory on its head. If you buy it, the whole idea of government spending, taxes, the nature of money changes, and, according to the theory, all we have to do is just open our eyes. It's a bit like staring at those optical illusions: First you see the faces, then, suddenly it's the goblet.

SALLY HELM, HOST:

We got a brilliant question...

ALEX GOLDMARK, HOST:

Brilliant.

HELM: ...On our PLANET MONEY Twitter account recently - a question that spawned this entire episode.

AMY: I asked my dad about a question, and he said he couldn't answer it. So he told me to come and ask you.

HELM: It came to us from Amy (ph), a 13-year-old listener in Bristol, England.

GOLDMARK: She listens with her dad.

HELM: And Amy's question - it's about the government and what it can spend. Here it is.

AMY: I had this idea that because they print money, instead of giving it to the bank and making inflation go up, they could use it just for the public services. And it would be much easier. And it would be it would be, in general, really good because there's lots of problems with, like, there's not enough tax to go around all of the schools and hospitals. So I thought maybe this might help. So thank you for listening. Yeah, thanks. Bye.

HELM: This question is brilliant. It has so many layers.

GOLDMARK: Like the first part - printing money. What is stopping the government from printing as much money as it wants?

HELM: Basically nothing.

GOLDMARK: And then, the spending part. If the government prints money, why do they need to take my money in taxes?

HELM: And Amy even calls out the possible fatal flaw...

GOLDMARK: Inflation.

HELM: ...Inflation. But she's like, are we sure that this would cause inflation?

GOLDMARK: And the answer is nope. Inflation ain't what it used to be.

HELM: Economists of all ages are rethinking how it works.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL TEPER AND PETER HAJIOFF'S "SPINNING PIANO")

HELM: At the heart of Amy's question is a paradox. The government can create money. But the government also says it doesn't have enough money to pay for stuff. Does that even make sense? Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sally Helm.

GOLDMARK: And I'm Alex Goldmark. Today on the show, the whole show is Amy's question. Can we buy everything we want? And if we try, will we be living in a utopia or an inflation nightmare?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

HELM: OK. Alex, we found the perfect person to answer Amy's question. She's an economist, had a similar question about 20 years ago, and has been thinking about it ever since. Her name is Stephanie Kelton. So what do you think? Is Amy onto something?

STEPHANIE KELTON: You know, young people can be so clear-minded. Yeah, she - that is an incredibly sort of astute way of framing it. You know, the government can fund itself by simply issuing the money. And Amy has hit on something that is well-known to economists. But it's just that most economists like to say, but that's not really a very serious way of going about things.

GOLDMARK: But Stephanie is serious.

HELM: She's a professor at Stony Brook University. She's one of the leaders of this movement within the left wing of economics. It's called Modern Monetary Theory.

GOLDMARK: Or the initials MMT for short. And they say the government could create money and spend more without necessarily raising taxes or causing runaway inflation.

HELM: If you're wondering, before this episode is over, we will all scream the word inflation together. They know about inflation. Wait for it.

GOLDMARK: So 13-year-old Amy - her question led us straight into this whole huge alternate theory of economics.

HELM: And at just the right time - MMT is having a moment right now. There's a corner of the economist Internet that is, like, obsessed with this idea.

KELTON: There are more MMT blogs today than - I don't know - McDonald's franchises or something. They're just, like, everywhere.

HELM: And it's not just the blogs.

GOLDMARK: Politicians have been asking Stephanie and her colleagues to be advisers.

HELM: Bernie Sanders.

GOLDMARK: Earlier this year, she gave a keynote in Parliament in London at the House of Lords.

HELM: The Lords couldn't get enough.

GOLDMARK: Most economists used to ignore these ideas as fringe or far-out. And a lot of them still do. But lately, some economists who used to shrug off these ideas - they're starting to write about MMT. And regular people - more and more of them are becoming converts every week.

HELM: And when Stephanie is talking to a potential new convert, she often starts with the first basic part of Amy's question...

GOLDMARK: About, what is money?

HELM: Can the government just print as much money as it wants?

KELTON: I don't like the phrase printing money. I'll just lay that out there.

HELM: OK. OK. We're going to say create money because most of the money out there is digital, not paper.

GOLDMARK: No shock here - right? - the way we mostly handle money in our lives.

HELM: I mean, in my life, it's basically only numbers ticking up and down in my bank account. I never touch paper basically.

GOLDMARK: And most of that digital money out there in the world actually comes from banks making loans. It's worth a second to explain this one. It's different than the way a lot of textbooks talk about it. Here is the idea; let's do it.

HELM: OK. So say economist Stephanie Kelton needs a hundred thousand dollars to start a pancake restaurant.

GOLDMARK: Yummy.

HELM: I don't know. The bank checks out her credit history, and they're like, you're good. They decide to give her the money.

KELTON: The loan officer will type some numbers into his or her computer, and my account balance is going to increase by $100,000.

GOLDMARK: That is it. The bank officer isn't thinking about cash. She's not going down to the vault and counting 20s.

KELTON: People say, what? That's crazy. What - where did the bank get the money to make the loan? Well, it got it from the keyboard, right? It was a one followed by a number of zeros.

HELM: Call it the power of the keyboard. Banks have it. And Stephanie says so does the government.

GOLDMARK: The superpower of the keyboard.

HELM: This is how Stephanie tells a story of government spending. When Congress spends money on aircraft carriers or whatever, they just tell the government's bank - the Federal Reserve - to go and type some money into the accounts of, basically, whoever's making aircraft carriers. Just type it in. So Stephanie says the question - can the government afford something? - the answer to that question is always yes.

So, like, can we afford to build a thousand new bridges?

KELTON: Yes.

GOLDMARK: Could we fill all of the potholes in all of New York City if we wanted to?

KELTON: Of course.

GOLDMARK: And also buy a hundred new aircraft carriers for the military?

KELTON: You could.

GOLDMARK: Build that border wall that Trump wants?

KELTON: You could afford it.

GOLDMARK: And college for everybody? Federal government could pay for it.

KELTON: Affordable.

GOLDMARK: Sounds like a utopia. There has to be a catch though, right? We know there's a catch. What's the catch?

HELM: OK. We're going to get to the catch, but quick asterisk here - these MMT ideas apply only to governments that control their own currency - currency that's backed by nothing but the government's good name. It's not pegged to another currency. And this doesn't work for countries that borrow in another currency.

GOLDMARK: So it applies to the U.S. and to the U.K., but not, say, to Greece because they use the euro or Venezuela because they have a bunch of debt in U.S. dollars.

HELM: Right - because then Greece and Venezuela can't use the power of the keyboard to pay back the debt if they need to in the same way.

GOLDMARK: Asterisk over?

HELM: Yes, it's over.

GOLDMARK: OK, let's go. OK. So from here on out, let's focus on the U.S. and the U.K. 13-year-old Amy, afterall, lives in the U.K.

HELM: This all leads us to the next part of our big question from Amy. The government can create money. So what's the point of taxes? Why does the government need to take my money in taxes?

GOLDMARK: The story on taxes that I always had in my head - it says that the government spends money because, you know, it has to.

HELM: It needs to pay for aircraft carriers and first-grade teachers.

GOLDMARK: And part of the government's job is to balance the amount of money that it spends with the amount of money that it takes in.

HELM: This is the part where you hear, you know, about Congress fighting over the budget.

GOLDMARK: The government takes in money in taxes. And if it needs a little extra, it borrows some money.

HELM: And then, across town, the Federal Reserve - the central bank - they look at the health of the overall economy and change interest rates or create some money, maybe remove some money from circulation to keep the economy in balance. Basically, the Fed handles that big picture stuff like fighting inflation. And meanwhile, Congress buys aircraft carriers.

GOLDMARK: But Modern Monetary Theory says it doesn't have to be this way.

HELM: Forget everything you know.

GOLDMARK: Back when Stephanie was a young grad student, she heard about a different way of looking at things. It was being shopped around by a finance guy named Warren Mosler.

HELM: He was looking at this whole system - the federal government, the central bank. And it's like when you're looking at one of those optical illusions - is it a goblet or is it two faces staring at each other?

GOLDMARK: I always see the faces first.

HELM: He's looking at the system, and it's like he suddenly sees the goblet.

GOLDMARK: If you look at it a little differently, then taxes don't finance spending - spending comes first and taxes second. This got me, so let's slow it down. Here's the old way. Taxes bring in the money, then government spends that money.

HELM: Mosler's new way - government just spends - power of the keyboard. Then the government has something to tax.

GOLDMARK: The money's is out there. So Stephanie was initially not sold on Warren Mosler's argument. She was like, this sounds fishy. I'm going to vet it.

KELTON: So I spent a number of months reading treasury manuals, Fed manuals, tracing out all of the balance sheet entries, going through the minutia of how government spending and taxation and financing actually works. I wrote it all down with all the complicating details. And I ended up reaching exactly the same conclusion that Warren had reached.

HELM: When she looks at all the details, she's like, whoa. Actually, yes - this is a valid way of looking at the world.

GOLDMARK: Which kind of throws off the whole way she was thinking about economics.

HELM: And there was this group of other economists talking about these ideas - thereabout about six or seven of them, eventually. And they become these Modern Monetary Theory people.

GOLDMARK: The MMT crowd is born.

HELM: Do you start talking about that at, like, the economist bar, where you guys are, like, drinking economist beers?

KELTON: Oh, totally. Totally - we named a cocktail after it.

HELM: (Laughter).

KELTON: No, I mean, it's...

HELM: The M-M-Tonic (ph).

KELTON: Yeah. It's the mind bender, I think, which is what we probably would have called it if we'd actually done it.

HELM: So in this mind-bending world, we still have the question, why does the government tax at all? Stephanie says, one reason...

KELTON: It taxes because it wants to remove some of the money that it spent into the economy so that it can guard against the risk of inflation.

HELM: Inflation.

GOLDMARK: Inflation. We told you we'd yell it.

HELM: We got there.

GOLDMARK: OK. This is one of the big ideas of Modern Monetary Theory. Taxes are not for spending. Taxes are for fighting inflation. And spending - that isn't just to buy stuff the government needs, but the power of the keyboard - the spending from that - can be put to use for doing all kinds of good things - to put money into the economy to give it a boost or to help get to full employment.

HELM: OK, so the government is spending money into the economy. Spend, spend, spend - and eventually, they're going to need to drain some money out.

GOLDMARK: And she says you can think of taxes as a way to do that.

HELM: Because, I mean, you've got to have a way to get money out of the economy, right?

GOLDMARK: And this is a big question that we had about MMT. If you remind the government that it has the power of the keyboard, is the government going to go crazy? And then, will you get, like, people with wheelbarrows full of cash, dumping piles of money on the counter when they want to buy a cup of coffee?

HELM: I'm going to sort of summarize, like, common objections that I here come up to this. And I think I could summarize them succinctly by saying just, like, Venezuela, Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe...

KELTON: Deeply thoughtful - right? - objections, yes.

HELM: I mean, so that's, like, countries that face hyperinflation.

KELTON: Well, those aren't serious objections. Those aren't - that's not a serious objection. That's someone who wants to resist what they're hearing. And so they throw out a word - Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Weimar Germany. And so - look. If you think hyperinflation is the necessary result of what I just described - the government sitting down with its budget and deciding how many dollars to write into each of these line items - you could well get inflation. I'm not denying that. The federal government could try to spend too much into an economy that doesn't have the room to absorb that much new spending. And you begin to get an inflation problem. I'm not suggesting that that can't happen.

GOLDMARK: But she thinks it wouldn't necessarily happen.

HELM: And we were like, wait, but wouldn't it happen?

GOLDMARK: I mean, if there's just a ton more money pumped into an economy, then everyone has more money. So then everyone's going to spend more money, and that is what drives up prices and causes inflation.

HELM: If there's more money out there through the government spending, then it's out there. And people can do whatever they want with it. So I'm trying to get my head around - like, wouldn't that cause inflation somehow? If everyone - a bunch of people - have more money because the government is spending a bunch more, then won't they spend that money on stuff? And couldn't that cause inflation?

KELTON: Well, where is it? Well, where is it? We've been doing it. We just did it with a $1.5 trillion tax cut. We did it with the 300 billion in additional spending. We've done it and done it and done it. Where is the inflation problem? I don't see it in the U.K. I don't see it in Japan. I don't see it in the U.S.

HELM: It's true. Countries, including the U.S., have had a hard time hitting the inflation targets that they want to hit for years.

GOLDMARK: We just did a whole episode on this two weeks ago.

HELM: So Stephanie says we shouldn't be freaking out about inflation right now.

GOLDMARK: But we do need to think about inflation. Here is her answer to the last part of Amy's question - should the government create as much money as it needs to?

HELM: Here comes the catch.

KELTON: Well, the catch is that all of these things are affordable in money terms. But, you know, I like to - sometimes I'll say, every economy has its own internal speed limit.

HELM: The speed limit - she says what you need to look at is how much money an economy can absorb before inflation takes off.

GOLDMARK: And the speed limit has to do with what economists call real resources. An economy is not just money.

HELM: Like, if you want to build a hospital, you can't build it out of money. You need concrete and glass and linoleum floor and sofas in the waiting room...

GOLDMARK: And those IV bags that hang on those sort of rolling coat-rack things.

HELM: You need someone to make those rolling coat-rack things, let alone doctors and nurses. Of course, you need them.

GOLDMARK: Stephanie says those things are what create the speed limit.

HELM: So say the factory that makes those wheeling coat-rack things is running at, like, half the capacity that it could. Then, if the government decides to place a big order for those coat-rack things, nothing bad really happens. They just buy them at the normal price, put them in the hospital - great.

GOLDMARK: Great.

HELM: But what if the factory is at full capacity? Then, the government has to say, hey, sell to our new hospital instead of to your other customers. And to get them to do it, they'll have to pay more. That is inflation. Prices just went up.

GOLDMARK: And if the government spends so much that it drives up prices all over the economy, that's your inflation problem.

HELM: Stephanie says that's what the government should think about - not whether they have enough money, but whether there are enough resources in the economy to soak up that money.

GOLDMARK: That is basically her answer to Amy. The government can create money and spend it up to that internal speed limit.

HELM: If you start to get inflation, that's a sign you might be spending too much. Maybe you could raise taxes to pull some of that money back in.

GOLDMARK: But if you don't see inflation, just go for it.

HELM: Now, clearly, not everyone sees it this way.

TOM PALLEY: The theory, I believe, has holes in it.

HELM: This is Tom Palley. He's an economist. He's done work for labor unions. And he's on the left of the economics profession, like MMT. But he's been a longtime critic.

GOLDMARK: Trouble in the family.

HELM: And we might as well say here, the reason we're only hearing from economists on the left in this episode is that the economists who are researching and writing about this theory - they mostly all tend to be on the left.

GOLDMARK: Economists who take a more traditional or conservative view - they tend to say you have to think about taxes as a way to finance spending. That is the responsible way to run a government.

HELM: To Tom Palley, Modern Monetary Theory is useful because it points out some flaws in mainstream economics. Like, he thinks that mainstream economics is too obsessed with balanced budgets.

GOLDMARK: But he has some doubts about MMT. A big one is the whole taxes thing - the idea of using taxes to fight inflation.

PALLEY: Politics doesn't work like that. Taxes are very, very contested. No one wants their taxes raised. It's very hard for politicians to raise taxes. They're very slow to do it because guess what? They don't get re-elected if they do.

GOLDMARK: He says it's just not realistic for the government to react fast enough to respond to inflation.

HELM: We put that to Stephanie Kelton.

KELTON: If your concern is that it would be difficult to fight inflation by raising taxes, that is obviously a legitimate concern - that it is difficult to get Congress to act quickly to do the right thing. And so one of the things that MMT economists have advocated for a very long time is finding a way to take the fingerprints of Congress off of the decision making. In other words, to make it happen automatically.

HELM: She says something like this kind of happens already, like when the economy is booming, you don't have to spend as much on unemployment insurance. People have jobs. So spending goes down automatically.

GOLDMARK: She says do more of that.

HELM: More types of taxing and spending that kick in automatically if inflation starts to tick up.

GOLDMARK: And also she says - and she's not alone in saying this - nobody has a good model of inflation right now.

HELM: And she thinks the government could spend a lot more money right now, and we'd still probably be fine.

GOLDMARK: OK, so we went looking for a way to explain to 13-year-old Amy whether the government can print money to spend on schools and hospitals and not have to raise taxes to do it. And we found this branch of economics - this movement even - with a whole new way of looking at how money works.

KELTON: Do you see the faces or the goblet?

GOLDMARK: You can pick which one you want to see.

HELM: Yeah - they say you can make this mental shift about taxes and spending. Don't think about them the way you think about your money in your private life. Like, do I have enough to buy this thing I want to buy?

GOLDMARK: The government is not a household.

HELM: Lots of economists agree there, by the way.

GOLDMARK: Instead, the Modern Monetary Theory folks - they say, start thinking about how taxes and spending affect the big economic stuff like employment and inflation.

HELM: The way it is now, it's the Federal Reserve's job to think about that.

GOLDMARK: Kind of just because that's how we set things up, like, way back when.

HELM: But MMT would say, government spending and taxing is actually a much more direct way to go about this. If you want more employment, don't fiddle with the interest rate; just hire people or buy things from businesses who will hire people.

GOLDMARK: There are definitely questions about how this works in practice. And this is far from the mainstream, textbook way that most economists talk about this stuff. And if you think government sucks, you probably aren't loving this plan.

HELM: But there's some logic to the idea that Congress should be thinking about the big stuff. Is the economy good? Are people employed? And that money isn't just a way to buy aircraft carriers. It's way more than that.

GOLDMARK: That's something the MMT folks want you to keep in mind.

HELM: Don't just think about money as a scarce resource - something you can run out of. Think about what you want money to do and go from there.

GOLDMARK: It's a different starting point for asking the question, can we afford something like a new hospital?

(SOUNDBITE OF DIAL TONE)

AMY: Hi.

HELM: Amy, is that you?

AMY: Yeah.

HELM: Amy, you asked us a question a couple of weeks ago. It was a really good question. And we have an answer for you.

AMY: I'm really excited. I'm, like, super excited. I didn't know that you were going to get back. I didn't think that this was going to happen.

HELM: Unfortunately, you have to listen to a whole episode of PLANET MONEY to get it. How does that sound?

AMY: OK.

HELM: (Laughter).

AMY: Yeah, that's really good. I'm excited.

GOLDMARK: After the break, Amy from Bristol.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

HELM: Amy.

AMY: Yes.

HELM: What do you think?

AMY: That was amazing. I was literally, like, trying to stop myself from, like, screaming because it was so good.

HELM: So what do you think? What's your takeaway? You had this question. It's a really, really good question. We found some stuff out. What do you think now?

AMY: I think it's really good. Like, listening to that - it just made me feel like I could be onto something really good.

GOLDMARK: So are you going to tell the other kids at school what you figured out here?

AMY: (Laughter) Yes, I'm definitely going to tell - I'm going to tell everyone, like, I'm so happy that you made that episode. And it just answered so many questions, like, that were in the question that I asked.

HELM: There is a lot we didn't get to in this episode - lots to pick apart here. Go hash it out on the Internet. We post every episode on Twitter and Facebook. We also have an Instagram for pretty pictures and probably fewer fights about inflation, though we do sometimes talk about inflation on our Instagram. What do you expect?

GOLDMARK: Today's episode was produced by Nick Fountain and Darian Woods. Our editor is Bryant Urstadt.

HELM: You, Alex Goldmark, are the supervising producer. Thank you for supervising. Thanks also to Brad DeLong and J.W. Mason, who were among the many people who helped me understand MMT. I'm Sally Helm.

GOLDMARK: And I'm Alex Goldmark. Thanks for listening.

AMY: Yeah, I just - I literally just came out of school today. And my dad is like, oh, my gosh, PLANET MONEY has emailed me and said that they've used your idea for an episode. And I was like, oh, my gosh.

We got a brilliant question brilliant on our Planet Money Twitter account recently a question that spawned this entire episode
I asked my dad about a question and he said he couldn't answer it
So he told me to come and ask you it came to us from Amy a 13 year old listener in Bristol, England
She listens with her dad and Amy's question. It's about the government and what it can spend here it is I
Had this idea that because they print money
Instead of giving it to the bank and making inflation go up
They could use it just for
The public services and it would be much easier and it would be it would be in general really good because I know there's lots of
Problems with like there's not enough
Tax to go around all the schools and hospitals. So I thought maybe this might help
So thank you for listening
Yeah, thanks. Bye
this question is
Brilliant, it has so many layers like the first part printing money
What is stopping the government from printing as much money as it wants?
Basically nothing and then the spending part if the government prints money
Why do they need to take my money in taxes and Amy even calls out the possible fatal flaw?
Inflation inflation, but she's like, are we sure that this would cause inflation and the answer is nope
Inflation ain't what it used to be economists of all ages. Are we thinking how it works?

But the government also says it doesn't have enough money to pay for stuff. Does that even make sense?
Hello and welcome to planet money, I'm Sally and I'm Alex Goldmark today on the show the whole show is Amy's question

She's an economist had a similar question about 20 years ago and has been thinking about it ever since her name is Stephanie

We will all scream the word inflation together. They know about inflation. Wait for it. So
13 year old Amy her question led us straight into this whole huge alternate theory of economics and at just the right time
MMT is having a moment right now
There's a corner of the economist internet that is like obsessed with this idea. There are more MMT blogs today than I
Don't know McDonald's franchise or something. There's like everywhere and it's not just the blogs
Politicians have been asking Stephanie and her colleagues to be advisors Bernie Sanders earlier this year
She gave a keynote in Parliament in London at the House of Lords the Lords couldn't get enough
Most economists used to ignore these ideas as fringe or far-out and a lot of them still do
but lately some economists who used to shrug off these ideas they're starting to write about MMT and
Regular people more and more of them are becoming converts every week
And when Stephanie is talking to a potential new convert
She often starts with the first basic part of Amy's question about what is money
Can the government just print as much money as it wants?
I don't like the phrase printing money. I'll just lay that out there. Okay. Okay, we're gonna say create money
Because most of the money out there is digital not paper. No shock here, right the way we mostly handle money in our lives
Yeah, I mean in my life. It's basically only numbers ticking up and down in my bank account
I've never touched paper basically and most of that digital money out there in the world actually comes from banks making loans
It's worth a second to explain this one. It's different than the way a lot of textbooks talk about it
Here is the idea. Let's do it. Okay, so say economist Stephanie Kelton needs $100,000 to
Start a pancake restaurant yummy. I don't know the bank checks out her credit history and they're like, you're good
They decide to give her the money the loan officer will type some numbers into his or her
Computer and my account balance is gonna increase by $100,000. That is it. The bank officer isn't thinking about cash
She's not going down to the vault and counting 20s. People say what?
That's crazy. What was she? Where did the bank get the money to make the loan?
No, I got it from the keyboard was a one followed by a number of zeros call it the power of the keyboard
Banks have it and Stephanie says so does the government superpower of the keyboard
This is how Stephanie tells a story of government spending when Congress spends money on aircraft carriers or whatever
They just tell the government's bank the Federal Reserve to go and type some money into the accounts of
Basically whoever is making aircraft carriers just type it in
So Stephanie says the question can the government afford something?
The answer to that question is always yes
So so like can we afford to build a thousand new bridges?
Yes, could we fill all of the potholes in all of New York City if we wanted to of course and also by
100 new aircraft carriers for the military you could build that border wall that Trump wants you could afford it and college for everybody
Federal government could pay for it affordable sounds like a utopia
There has to be a catch though, right? We know there's a catch. What's the catch?
Okay, we're gonna get to the catch but quick asterisk here
These MMT ideas apply only to governments that control their own currency
Currency that's backed by nothing, but the government's good name
It's not pegged to another currency and this doesn't work for countries that borrow in another currency
So it applies to the US and to the UK
But not say to Greece because they use the euro or Venezuela because they have a bunch of debt in US dollars
Right because then Greece and Venezuela
Can't use the power of the keyboard to pay back the debt if they need to in the same way
Okay, so from here on out let's focus on the US and the UK 13 year old Amy after all lives in the UK
This all leads us to the next part of our big question from Amy. The government can create money. So
What's the point of taxes?
Why does the government need to take my money in taxes the story on taxes that I always had in my head
It says that the government spends money because you know
It has to that needs to pay for aircraft carriers and first grade teachers
And part of the government's job is to balance the amount of money that it spends with the amount of money that it takes
In this is the part where you hear, you know about Congress fighting over the budget
the government takes in money in taxes and
If it needs a little extra it borrow some money and then across town the Federal Reserve the central bank
they look at the health of the overall economy and change interest rates or
Create some money maybe remove some money from circulation to keep the economy in balance
Basically the Fed handles that big picture stuff like fighting inflation and meanwhile Congress buys aircraft carriers
But modern monetary theory says it doesn't have to be this way forget everything
You know back when Stephanie was a young grad student
She heard about a different way of looking at things
It was being shoved around by a finance guy named Warren Mosler
he was looking at this whole system the federal government the central bank and
It's like when you're looking at one of those optical illusions
Is it a goblet or is it two faces staring at each other? I always see the faces first
He's looking at the system and it's like he suddenly sees the goblet
If you look at it a little differently then taxes don't finance spending spending comes first and taxes second
This got me. So let's slow it down. Here's the old way taxes bring in the money
Then government spends that money Mosler's new way
Government just spends power the keyboard then the government has something to tax money's out there
So Stephanie was initially not sold on wine Mosler's argument. She was like this sounds fishy
I'm gonna vet it so I spent a number of months reading Treasury manuals Fed manuals
tracing out all of the balance sheet entries going through the
minutiae of how government
Spending and taxation and financing actually works. I wrote it all down with all the complicating details and
I ended up reaching exactly the same conclusion that Warren had reached when she looks at all the details. She's like whoa
Actually, yes
This is a valid way of looking at the world which kind of throws off the whole way
She was thinking about economics and there's this group of other economists talking about these ideas
They're about six or seven of them eventually and they become these modern monetary theory people the MMT crowd is born
Do you start talking about that at like the economist bar where you guys are like drinking economist beers?
totally totally
We named a cocktail after it
Yeah, it's the mind-bender I
Probably would have called it if we'd actually done it
So in this mind-bending world, we still have the question. Why does the government tax at all?
Stephanie says one reason it taxes
Because it wants to remove some of the money that it's spent into the economy
So that it can guard against the risk of inflation
We told you we'd yell it we got there
Okay
This is one of the big ideas of modern monetary theory taxes are not for spending taxes are for fighting inflation
and
Spending that isn't just to buy stuff the government needs but the power of the keyboard the spending from that
Can be put to use for doing all kinds of good things to put money into the economy to give it a boost or to
Help get to full employment. Okay, so the government is spending money into the economy spend spend spend and
Eventually, they're gonna need to drain some money out and she says you can think of taxes as a way to do that
Because I mean you got to have a way to get money out of the economy, right?
And and this is a big question that we had about MMT if you remind the government that it has the power of the keyboard
Is the government gonna go crazy?
And then will you get like people with wheelbarrows full of cash dumping piles of money on the counter when they want to
Buy a cup of coffee
I'm gonna sort of summarize like common objections that I hear come up to this and I think I could summarize them
succinctly by saying just like
Venezuela
Weimar Germany
Zimbabwe
Deeply thoughtful
right
Objections. Yes, though. I mean so that's like countries that they type in serious objections
Those aren't those that's not a serious objection. That's someone who wants to resist what they're hearing and so they throw out a word
Zimbabwe
Venezuela Weimar Germany
And so look if you think hyper
Inflation is the necessary result of what I just described
The government sitting down with its budget and deciding how many dollars to write in to each of these line items
You could well get inflation
I'm not denying that the federal government could try to spend too much into an economy that doesn't have the room to absorb
That much new spending and you begin to get an inflation problem
I'm not I'm not suggesting that that can't happen
But she thinks it wouldn't necessarily happen and we were like wait
But wouldn't it happen if there's just a ton more money pumped into an economy then everyone has more money
So they're never one's gonna spend more money
And that is what drives up prices and causes inflation if there's more money out there through the government spending then it's it's out there
And people can do whatever they want with it
So I'm trying to get my head around like wouldn't wouldn't that cause inflation somehow if everyone a bunch of people have more money
Because the government is spending a bunch more then won't they spend that money on stuff and
Where is it where is it we've been doing it we just did it with a one and a half trillion dollar tax cut
We did it with a three hundred billion
In additional spending we we've done it and done it and done it. Where is the inflation problem?
I don't see it in the UK. I don't see it in Japan. I don't see it in the US
It's true countries including the US have had a hard time hitting the inflation targets that they want to hit for years
We just did a whole episode on this two weeks ago
So Stephanie says we shouldn't be freaking out about inflation right now, but we do need to think about inflation
Here is her answer to the last part of Amy's question
Should the government create as much money as it needs to here comes the catch?
Well, the catch is that all of these things are affordable in money terms
But you know, I like to sometimes I'll say every economy has its own internal speed limit the speed limit
She says what you need to look at is how much money an economy can absorb
Before inflation takes off and the speed limit has to do with what economists call real
Resources an economy is not just money. Like if you want to build a hospital
You can't build it out of money
You need concrete and glass and linoleum floor and sofas in the waiting room and those IV bags that hang on those sort
Of rolling coat rack things you need someone to make those rolling coat rack things
Let alone doctors and nurses, of course, you need them Stephanie says those things are what create the speed limit
So say the factory that makes those wheeling coat rack things is running at like half the capacity that it could
Then if the government decides to place a big order for those coat rack things
Nothing bad really happens. They just buy them at the normal price put them in the hospital great great
But what if the factory is at full capacity?
Then the government has to say hey sell to our new hospital instead of to your other customers and to get them to do it
They'll have to pay more
That is inflation prices just went up and if the government spends so much that it drives up prices all over the economy
That's your inflation problem. Stephanie says that's what the government should think about not whether they have enough money
But whether there are enough resources in the economy to soak up that money
That is basically her answer to Amy the government can create money and spend it up to that internal speed limit if you start to
Get inflation. That's a sign. You might be spending too much
Maybe you could raise taxes to pull some of that money back in but if you don't see inflation, just go for it
Now clearly not everyone sees it this way. Their theory I believe has holes in it. This is Tom Pally
He's an economist. He's done work for labor unions and
He's on the left of the economics profession like MMT, but he's been a longtime critic trouble in the family
And we might as well say here
The reason we're only hearing from economists on the left in this episode is that the economists who are researching and writing about this theory
They mostly all tend to be on the left economists who take a more traditional or conservative view
They tend to say you have to think about taxes as a way to finance spending
That is the responsible way to run a government to Tom Pally
Modern monetary theory is useful because it points out some flaws in mainstream economics
Like he thinks that mainstream economics is too obsessed with balanced budgets
But he has some doubts about MMT a big one is the whole taxes thing the idea of using taxes to fight inflation
Politics doesn't work like that taxes are very very contested. No one wants their taxes raised
It's very hard for politicians to raise taxes. They're very slow to do it because guess what they don't get reelected if they do
He says it's just not realistic for the government to react fast enough to respond to inflation
We put that to Stephanie Kelton if your concern is that it would be difficult to fight inflation by raising taxes
That is obviously a legitimate concern
That it is difficult to get Congress to act quickly to do the right thing. And so one of the things that MMT
economists have advocated for very long time is
finding a way to
Take the fingerprints of Congress off of the decision-making in other words to make it happen automatically
She says something like this kind of happens already like when the economy is booming
You don't have to spend as much on unemployment insurance people have jobs. So spending goes down automatically
She says do more of that more types of taxing and spending that kick in automatically if inflation starts to tick up
And also she says and she's not alone in saying this
Nobody has a good model of inflation right now and she thinks the government could spend a lot more money right now
And we'd still probably be fine
Okay, so we went looking for a way to explain to 13 year old Amy whether the government can print money to spend on schools
And hospitals and not have to raise taxes to do it and we found this branch of economics this movement
Even with a whole new way of looking at how money works
Do you see the faces or the goblet you can pick which one you want to see?
Yeah, they say you can make this mental shift about taxes and spending
Don't think about them the way you think about your money in your private life
Like do I have enough to buy this thing?
I want to buy the government is not a household lots of economists agreed there by the way
Instead the modern monetary theory folks
They say start thinking about how taxes and spending affect the big economic stuff like employment and inflation
The way it is now it's the Federal Reserve's job to think about that kind of just because that's how we set
Things up like way back when but MMT would say government spending and taxing is actually a much more direct way to go about this
If you want more employment don't fiddle with the interest rate just hire people or buy things from businesses who will hire people
There are definitely questions about how this works in practice
And this is far from the mainstream
textbook way that most economists talk about this stuff and if you think government sucks
You probably aren't loving this plan
But there's some logic to the idea that Congress should be thinking about the big stuff is the economy good
Are people employed and that money isn't just a way to buy aircraft carriers?
It's way more than that that's something the MMT folks want you to keep in mind
Don't just think about money as a scarce resource something you can run out of
Think about what you want money to do and go from there
It's a different starting point for asking the question. Can we afford something like a new hospital?
Hi
Amy is that you?
Yeah
Amy you asked us a question a couple weeks ago. It was a really good question and we have an answer for you
I'm really excited
I'm like super excited. I didn't know that
You're gonna get back. I didn't think that this was gonna happen
Unfortunately, you have to listen to a whole episode of Planet Money to get it. How does that sound?
Okay. Yeah, that's that's really good
After the break Amy from Bristol
Support for NPR and the following message come from the business platinum card from American Express
Platinum enhances life's moments both big and small so that you can do business to the fullest. Don't do business without it
Hey, it's Guy Raz here
And on the next how I built this how a group of spandex wearing teenage superheroes called the Power Rangers
Help turn Haim Saban into one of the richest men on earth. You can find how I built this wherever you listen to podcasts
Amy
Yeah
What do you think?
That was amazing. I was literally like trying to stop myself from like
Screaming so say good
So what do you think? What's it? What's your takeaway?
You have this question. It's a really really good question. We found some stuff out. What do you think now?
I think it's really good. Like listening to that
It just made me feel like I could be on something really good
So are you gonna tell the other kids at school what you figured out here?
Yes, I'm definitely gonna tell I'm gonna tell everyone like I'm so happy that you made
That episode and it just answered so many questions like that. We're in the question that I are
There is a lot we didn't get to in this episode lots to pick apart here go hash it out on the internet
We post every episode on Twitter and Facebook
We also have an Instagram for pretty pictures and probably fewer fights about inflation though
We do sometimes talk about inflation on our Instagram. What do you expect?
Today we're going to talk about inflation
Probably fewer fights about inflation though. We do sometimes talk about inflation on our Instagram. What do you expect?
Today's episode was produced by Nick Fountain and Darianne Woods. Our editor is Brian Erstad. You Alex Goldmark are the supervising producer
Thank you for supervising. Thanks also to Brad DeLong and JW Mason who were among the many people who helped me understand MMT
I'm Sally Helm and I'm Alex Goldmark. Thanks for listening
Yeah, I just I literally just came out of school today
My dad is like, oh my gosh Planet Money has
E-mailed me and said that they've used your idea for an episode and I was like, oh my gosh
