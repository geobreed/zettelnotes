The first lottery was a royal affair with poems, golden flatware and invited criminals. Also, how someone won the lottery over and over.

A version of this episode originally ran in January 2016.

Tonight's Mega Millions jackpot is the largest in history at $1.6 billion. And we've got lottery fever again.
Planet Money
#676: The First Lottery & How To Beat The Odds

Today on the show, the story of the first known lottery. It goes back to Queen Elizabeth in 1567, involves poems, gold plates, and petty criminals. It didn't go well. And we have the story of lottery legend Stefan Mandel. He created a system to take the luck out of the lottery and won jackpot after jackpot. He tells us how he pulled it off. (Think bank heist but legal.)

ALEX GOLDMARK, HOST:

Hey, it's Alex.

(SOUNDBITE OF PAPER RUSTLING)

GOLDMARK: Do you hear that rustle? That's the sound of $1.6 billion coming my way - a lottery ticket - 10, 11, 51, 52, 62, 18. I picked those exact numbers because they are the same ones that were on the PLANET MONEY lottery ticket almost three years ago. Thank you to everybody, by the way, messaging us about that episode, asking for a replay. At the time we did that show, the Powerball pot was at $1.5 billion, the biggest prize there had been up till then.

America had lottery fever, and we got it, too. We scrambled to find the best stories we could about the lottery. We found the older lottery on record. We talked to the man who beat the odds over and over again. And we crunched the numbers on whether or not it is a good deal to buy a ticket when the pot is as big as it is right now. And the numbers, by the way, back then - pretty much the same as they are right now. The outcome doesn't change. So we're leaving those calculations in the show.

Only other thing I have to say is what our producer Darian Woods has put in front of me and made me promise to read. I solemnly swear to split the pot with PLANET MONEY if we win with this lottery ticket even though I bought it with my own money. OK, with that, here's the episode from 2016.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: All right, we have just 24 hours to put this whole show together. And also, I need to know who's in.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: I'm in.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I'm definitely in.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: In.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: For sure.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I don't want to miss out.

ROBERT SMITH, BYLINE: Yeah, you're in. I'm in, too. We're both in.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: I'm in.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: I'm in. Stacey, you've never bought a ticket before?

VANEK SMITH: Never bought a ticket.

KESTENBAUM: Never.

VANEK SMITH: No, I'm super excited. I don't even know how to do it.

KESTENBAUM: Who here has bought a lottery ticket before?

SMITH: I have bought a lottery ticket before. In fact, I have one right here for the drawing this week.

VANEK SMITH: No way, Robert Smith.

SMITH: I have it. Don't look at the numbers.

KESTENBAUM: All right, the two of you, buy us a ticket.

SMITH: I feel like actually we could win. Like, that is the mind trick at the center of this. I feel like we might win.

(LAUGHTER)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Rich.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: And I'm Robert Smith. This week, the Powerball lottery is up to $1.5 billion. Perhaps you've heard. So like everyone else in the country, we are getting no work done. We are spending all of our time dreaming.

VANEK SMITH: We have the story of one of the very first lotteries. The main prize is amazing. You won't believe it.

SMITH: And we have the story of the one time it made absolute economic sense to play the lottery. And we talked to the guy who pulled it off. Oh, but first, Stacey, you and I - we've got to take care of some business.

VANEK SMITH: All right.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Five number here and (unintelligible).

SMITH: Five numbers here and one number here.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Yeah.

SMITH: OK.

(SOUNDBITE OF COINS CLINGING)

SMITH: So since we have some time to kill before we quit our jobs, we thought we would talk about one of the very first times a lottery existed. And we have David Kestenbaum and Stacey Vanek Smith here to tell that story.

KESTENBAUM: Can I give you a footnote? This is the first state lottery that we have good records of.

SMITH: Oh, as always.

KESTENBAUM: It was a long time ago. It was 1567.

SMITH: Wait; 1567 - really?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, it was in England. And they have this problem - like, the harbors are falling apart. They need money, but everybody hates taxes. So their finance minister had just been to the Netherlands. He saw they were sort of trying out lotteries there, and it worked well. And he decided, let's do it in England.

VANEK SMITH: But this was brand new in England, and so they had to try to figure out how to explain what a lottery was to people, how to get people on board and, most importantly, how to sell tickets.

SMITH: Like a lottery ad campaign - you may be a winner.

VANEK SMITH: Exactly. And we talked to David Dean. He is a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa. And he told us the lottery in England was something like this. So imagine it is 1567. You walk into the public market on Saturday, and there is a man shouting, buy lottery tickets.

DAVID DEAN: We know that they have a trumpeter. Sometimes they put on a little play about, you know, oh, I'm so poor; I’m so poor; I'm so poor; oh, my God, I've won the lottery, yippee, I'm happy ever after, you know?

SMITH: That is basically what lottery ads are to this day - rich people going like, I can't believe it. I'm so lucky.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, like, throwing money in the air. He says they're also - in the market, you would have seen this, like, big poster that had the official seal of the government saying, you can trust it; this is for real. And in the middle of it, there were these pictures of the prizes. This thing still exists, and he described it to us.

DEAN: The prizes are really cool because they show jugs and plates, and they're all gold and silver, but they also have monkeys holding bags of coin.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) And wait until you hear the grand prize.

DEAN: Whosoever shall win the greatest and most excellent prize shall receive the value of 5,000 pounds sterling. That is to say, 3,000 pounds in ready money - that's cash - 700 pounds' worth of plate gold and white and the rest in good tapestry, and also a bunch of linen cloth as well.

VANEK SMITH: What is the gold plate? Is that in, like, a bar? What does that mean?

DEAN: No, it would be plates and jugs and chalices.

KESTENBAUM: Oh, plates, like, to eat off of.

DEAN: Yeah, and you would sell that to melt it down, or you'd treasure it (laughter) on your mantelpiece.

KESTENBAUM: So that's a pretty good grand prize.

DEAN: I mean, it would be riches beyond everyone's dreams.

KESTENBAUM: He says here's how it would work. You would pay 10 shillings to get one lottery ticket, and you would write a poem.

SMITH: Wait; wait; wait; there was a skill part of this?

KESTENBAUM: Well, it was just something to uniquely identify yourself, you know, in case you won. He has a whole list of these today.

DEAN: God is mighty may I win. Or God speed my lot. And there's some very obscure ones like snake's meat with garlic is good to eat.

VANEK SMITH: Why didn't people just leave their name?

DEAN: They don't have the variety of names that we have today. And there would be a lot of confusion. There are a lot of Tom Smiths and…

VANEK SMITH: And Robert Smiths.

DEAN: ...Robert Smiths and…

VANEK SMITH: Their lottery was so much more literary than ours. I feel like it's so much classier. They had, like, criers, and everybody wrote poems. And now we have, like, a guy with a bunch of ping-pong balls and a vacuum machine.

DEAN: Exactly, yeah, on TV.

SMITH: They should absolutely do that today. Like, that is like - I want everyone - you should have to do something in order to get lottery. You should have to do a little play or write a poem, sing a song.

KESTENBAUM: What's your poem?

SMITH: I cannot think of anything funny, but the winners clearly are PLANET MONEY.

VANEK SMITH: Nice, that's pretty good.

SMITH: That's a lame rhyme.

KESTENBAUM: He says it's unclear exactly how this worked, but one possibility is, like, when they pulled out the winning ticket, they would just read, like, the first half. And the person who could complete the poem, that would prove it was them.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: But he says despite, like, the trumpet and all that stuff, there are not a lot of ticket sales in the early days. The whole idea of a lottery is just new. And people do not trust the government. You know, they're not sure they're going to get their golden plates. And another thing is, the tickets were expensive. They were 10 shillings.

DEAN: For a carpenter, let's say, in the city of London, who's a pretty well-paid person compared to carpenters elsewhere, they're earning five shillings a week. So this would be a fortnight - half your month's salary. For many people, it would have been the equivalent of a month's salary. And if you're a laborer or a plowman or something, you're talking about six months' salary.

VANEK SMITH: So a lot of people ended up going in on a lottery ticket together exactly like we did. But they also had another idea to further entice people into buying tickets. They agreed to not arrest people when they came in to buy tickets.

KESTENBAUM: And the idea was like, you know, if you lived out in the country or something and maybe you'd done something wrong, like you'd stolen a loaf of bread from somebody - like, don't worry. You can come into town where you might normally be arrested, and we're not going to arrest you. You can buy a ticket.

SMITH: Wow, it's kind of like the amnesty they have on overdue library books.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: They're like, just for this one day only, give us your money, and we won't arrest you.

KESTENBAUM: It says all ticket holders were promised freedom from arrest for all crimes other than murder, felonies, piracy or treason. That covers a lot.

DEAN: It does. It covers a huge amount. They really, really wanted people to come and buy tickets.

SMITH: So finally the big moment comes, right? Everyone gathers downtown. It's outside St. Paul's Cathedral. They're going to pick the winner. He says he thinks it was probably all the tickets were in a barrel, and there was one official who pulled out the winner. And you want to know who the winner is?

DEAN: We don't know.

KESTENBAUM: What?

DEAN: That's the trouble. We have no idea.

KESTENBAUM: So there's no media coverage of the winner.

DEAN: No media coverage of the winner at all, no.

SMITH: In the newspapers of the day - nothing.

DEAN: None at all, no.

VANEK SMITH: What he can say is that this lottery was a total failure. They only sold about one-tenth the number of tickets they were supposed to sell. And they actually ended up cutting back the prize.

DEAN: To one-twelfth of what it had been.

KESTENBAUM: Woah.

VANEK SMITH: Grand prize got cut by that much.

DEAN: Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Oh my gosh, that's - I mean, no wonder. That's - that doesn't seem fair.

DEAN: And of course that just reinforced everybody's sense that, OK, this is a failure, and it's not working. And we will never try it again.

KESTENBAUM: But they did try it again.

DEAN: Well, they did over a hundred years later, yeah.

SMITH: So were people smarter back then? I mean, did even back then people went, I have no chance of winning?

KESTENBAUM: I asked. I said, was it that, you know, they're like, this is a stupid investment. Why did I do this? He said, no, no, it was just they didn't trust the government, and it was very, very expensive.

VANEK SMITH: I wonder if they, like, cut the plates in half or something. Or you would get a twelfth of a golden plate (laughter).

SMITH: There's somebody eating off those plates right now, OK?

KESTENBAUM: But that's basically how it started, you know? The trend has been toward bigger and bigger piles of money. You know, we had - first we had the state lotteries. And then someone was like, oh, we can have a much bigger pot with lower odds if we do a national lottery. And that's what we have today. That's the 1.5 billion - does not include gold plates.

SMITH: Thank you, David.

KESTENBAUM: You're welcome.

VANEK SMITH: And Stacey, stick around 'cause we got to do some math.

VANEK SMITH: OK, my favorite subject.

SMITH: OK, because we're economics reporters, we have to sort of do the numbers here and show you that this is a terrible, terrible, terrible financial investment. No matter how excited we are about it, the numbers do not work in your favor. Very quickly, back-of-the-envelope - the odds of winning - 1 in 292 million. It costs two dollars for every ticket, so if you wanted to buy every possible combination, that would be $600 million - is what it would take.

VANEK SMITH: So if the pot's over 600 million, then it starts to be worth it.

SMITH: Yeah, you know, that's not true. So it's, like, 1.5 billion is what you would get over many years. So if you took the lump sum, they figure it would be about $930 million, OK - still pretty good. But then you have to take away taxes. You have to pay the highest tax rate on your lottery winnings. So that would mean you would be left with about $561 million dollars after you take away federal taxes. But of course, you and I and the PLANET MONEY team live in New York, so we would have to pay a city tax and a state tax. So basically it would whittle down to about $500 million - would be our lottery winning.

VANEK SMITH: Well plus, we have to split that eight ways.

SMITH: Yeah, or more because the big danger for anyone who thinks they can game the system and play the odds is for the lottery is that you have no control over who else buys your numbers. We could win with our numbers, and somebody else out there could get the exact same numbers.

VANEK SMITH: But what are the chances of someone picking exactly the same numbers in exactly the same order?

SMITH: Well, you know, in order to show this as an economic lesson, I did do something after you left the corner store that you did not hear. So let's play that tape.

OK, Stacey's left, so I would like to buy the exact same number again. But this one's me personally. I just want to get the same number again.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Same number.

SMITH: Same number.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Same time, same number coming - do you know more paying the tax?

SMITH: (Laughter) All right, so one of these is mine, and one of these is the rest of the team's.

VANEK SMITH: Robert...

SMITH: (Laughter).

VANEK SMITH: Robert...

SMITH: So let's just say that...

VANEK SMITH: What?

SMITH: ...If our numbers hit, PLANET MONEY, of which I'm a member, has to split it with Robert Smith the individual.

VANEK SMITH: Judas.

SMITH: (Laughter).

VANEK SMITH: That's like - you just stole millions of dollars from us.

SMITH: The odds are not good this is going to happen.

VANEK SMITH: Well, fictional millions, but still, that makes it worse.

SMITH: (Laughter) I'm trying to demonstrate how difficult it is to consider the lottery a sane financial investment. But when we were doing our research for the show, we discovered that there was one guy who managed to figure out how to game this entire system. And with that story is PLANET MONEY's senior producer, Alex Goldmark. Hey, Alex.

GOLDMARK: Hi, Robert. So it's 1992...

SMITH: OK.

GOLDMARK: ...In Virginia. And there is a big lottery jackpot for the time, $27 million. They pull the numbers, a winner. And at first, there's nobody who comes forward. But there are reports that there was something that was maybe going on before the lottery drawing.

SMITH: Something suspicious.

GOLDMARK: It starts to dawn on them that something is up. Something is different about this lottery drawing, right? So first of all, there's these reports from around town. People had been going into different grocery stores, buying 50,000 tickets at a time in different combinations. And they put it all together, and they realized that someone or some people have pulled off what is the dream of all lottery players. They took the luck out of lottery. They bought every single combination of numbers possible and guaranteed themselves a win. And this is totally perplexing to the people who run the lottery system like Ken Thorson, head of the Virginia lottery. This is him on TV shortly after.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KEN THORSON: I really never would have imagined that anybody would have ever wanted to try to buy it out. It never happened in the United States, but the very idea of spending over $7 million to buy all the shares in the lottery just seems preposterous.

SMITH: Because think of what it would take. I mean, you need investment of $7 million, and then you actually have to actually go and buy that many lottery tickets. You're going to be buying tickets 24 hours a day.

GOLDMARK: You need to fill out each different ticket. You need to keep track of where each ticket went so when you win, you can find the winning ticket.

SMITH: And yet somebody pulled it off.

GOLDMARK: Yes. His name is Stefan Mandel. And I did a little research, poked around, and I found him living on a tropical island in the South Pacific.

SMITH: Of course he is.

GOLDMARK: In Vanuatu.

SMITH: Of course.

GOLDMARK: I made a phone call. I got his cellphone, and I rang him up.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

GOLDMARK: Hello.

STEFAN MANDEL: Hello.

GOLDMARK: Hi. Is this Stefan Mandel?

MANDEL: Yeah.

GOLDMARK: I told him I'm a reporter and that I'm doing a story about lotteries.

Are you willing to talk to me about it for the radio?

MANDEL: (Laughter) That story died a long time ago.

GOLDMARK: As soon as I started asking him questions, he just could not stop. He lit up 'cause he's proud that he pulled this off. And he says listen, Alex; that Virginia thing - it took him decades and decades to perfect his system to get to that level. The story starts in Romania.

SMITH: In Romania.

GOLDMARK: Yeah, in the late 1950s, and Stefan Mandel is working at some job he doesn't really like at an industrial mining company. And he's got a young wife, young kids. And he just desperately wants out of the country. He needs money to do it, and he starts looking at the lottery.

MANDEL: Well, that was the only way I could get some serious money quickly. I mean, you know, I was earning at the time, something like 360 leu a month, which was the equivalent of a good pair of shoes (laughter), you know?

GOLDMARK: But he doesn't just go out and buy random tickets. He's a pretty natural math whiz. He goes to the library, and he starts reading math paper after math paper after math paper, and he comes up with a formula for buying blocks of tickets that he thinks should guarantee him a prize.

SMITH: Because he doesn't have enough money to buy every number.

GOLDMARK: Not yet, OK? He pulls in three friends. They take their money together. They still don't have enough money to buy every combination, but they figure they can guarantee themselves second prize.

MANDEL: We won 72,783 leu, which was equivalent of about 18 years of salary.

GOLDMARK: All right - big score. That was on your first try.

MANDEL: Yeah.

GOLDMARK: Be honest. Was that luck? Was that luck?

MANDEL: It was luck.

GOLDMARK: OK.

MANDEL: Well, a bit - quite a bit of luck.

GOLDMARK: Because he was playing for second prize, but he happened to win first prize.

SMITH: Nice.

GOLDMARK: Right? So he takes the money, and he leaves Romania finally, brings his family. And they end up in Australia. And this is where he takes his lottery plan to the next level, OK? He finds more investors. He raises more money, and he - this is where he solves what is really the obstacle to this whole crazy scheme, right? Normally when you want to pick out your own numbers for the lottery, you go to the corner, and you ask for that little form with the numbers on it, and you fill out each form.

SMITH: Yeah, with a pencil. It takes forever.

GOLDMARK: It takes a while.

SMITH: Yeah.

GOLDMARK: But he says no, no, no, I am not going to get caught up in that. I'm going to automate it. So he sets up a room filled with printers and a computer program that is going to spit out those forms already filled out with every possible combination...

SMITH: It's going to fill out the forms for him.

GOLDMARK: ...At high speed.

MANDEL: So we actually - we took the paper, analyzed the chemicals composition of the paper, the ink, and all that other stuff, and we printed out the slips ready with the combinations on them.

SMITH: Wait, so was this legal to have a computer fill out your slips for you?

GOLDMARK: It was legal when he did it. And he turned lottery winning into a business for a while.

MANDEL: In Australia, I won 12 times.

GOLDMARK: (Laughter).

MANDEL: So I kind of got caught up (unintelligible). So they held that they had to do something about it, which was ridiculous.

GOLDMARK: They changed the laws. First they passed a law that said no one person can buy every combination of lottery tickets (laughter).

SMITH: That's wise, yeah.

GOLDMARK: It's just a literally do-not-do-that-again law. And so then he broke it up into 50 different people who each bought one-fiftieth of the numbers. And so he keeps winning, and eventually they make enough sufficient laws that prevent him from doing it again.

SMITH: But this did not put Stefan out of business.

GOLDMARK: No, he started looking even bigger. He starts looking to the U.S. And he looks to a couple different states. He starts doing the calculations again.

SMITH: Because you have to find a place where the jackpot is big enough to justify all this printing and all this effort.

GOLDMARK: Right. So he finds Virginia. And in Virginia, there are 7.1 million combinations of lottery tickets. And he has to wait until the jackpot is, he figures, 25 million or above just to make sure he turns a profit if there is a split pot. And then he waits. He sets up his whole operation for when the time is right.

MANDEL: Yeah, that's something that you can't do in one day. It took us around two months or something, three months.

GOLDMARK: To print out the numbers.

MANDEL: Yeah, of course.

GOLDMARK: They printed out all 7.1 million tickets in Australia, paid $60,000 to ship them to the U.S., negotiated bulk buys with grocery stores all around Virginia about how they could send cashier's checks to buy tens of thousands of lottery tickets. I mean, it's like a bank heist how complicated this was.

SMITH: And I imagine on the night of the Virginia lottery, he did not have the same feeling that all of us have right now awaiting the numbers to come out for the big Powerball. I mean, this guy knew he had it in the bag.

GOLDMARK: Yeah. But I asked him, were you scared? Were you worried? Were you excited? He was just like, no, I have all the tickets.

MANDEL: I knew that I would win one first prize, six second prizes, 132 third prizes and thousands minor prizes.

GOLDMARK: Twenty-seven million plus all those minor prizes...

SMITH: ...Wow...

GOLDMARK: ...Thrown in.

SMITH: (Laughter).

GOLDMARK: There is a little dispute about whether or not he really bought all of these tickets or whether he came pretty close 'cause there were a few stores who just said, oh, my God, this is too much; you have to stop coming in with all these tickets in the middle of his buying spree. But he swears to me that he found workarounds for all of that. He had backup plans. And in the end, he did buy all the tickets.

SMITH: So did he have any advice for anyone who was thinking of doing this on the scale of Powerball, these giant, like, billion-dollar prizes that are coming out now?

GOLDMARK: It cannot be done anymore. He says you cannot do it. The number of combinations have grown too much. You wouldn't be able to print the tickets. You wouldn't be able to buy them in time, and you probably couldn't even do the math right to figure it out without making a mistake.

SMITH: So he might be the last guy who was able to corner the market in the lottery.

GOLDMARK: The great lottery corner of 1992 will remain the great lottery corner.

SMITH: All right, Alex, see you on the beach of Vanuatu.

GOLDMARK: If our numbers come up, definitely, Robert. After the break - a lottery lawyer.

SMITH: So there is one last thing that we wanted to do. Stacy and I called one man, one man who was almost certain to profit off of this Powerball fever.

So is this thelotterylawyer.com?

JASON KURLAND: Correct.

SMITH: What's your actual name?

KURLAND: Jason Kurland. K-U-R-L-A-N-D.

VANEK SMITH: And how much did it cost to buy your URL?

KURLAND: I don't remember. It wasn't much. It wasn't much.

SMITH: (Laughter).

VANEK SMITH: Have people found you through that website?

KURLAND: Oh, yeah.

SMITH: It sounds like this is a much more wise investment - buying lotterylawyer.com - than buying a lottery ticket.

KURLAND: (Laughter) Almost any investment is a better investment than buying a lottery ticket.

SMITH: He's right. All this fun we’ve had aside, you really should not buy a lottery ticket. It's a terrible investment.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah, especially since we don't want to split the pot any more than we already have to.

SMITH: Do not buy 10, 11, 51, 52, 62, 18.

**faster whisper:**
Hey, it's Alex.
Do you hear that, Russell? That is the sound of
$1.6 billion dollars coming my way. A lottery ticket.
10, 11, 51, 52, 62, 18.
I picked those exact numbers because they are the same ones that were on the Planet Money lottery ticket almost three years ago.
Thank you to everybody, by the way, messaging us about that episode asking for a replay.
At the time we did that show, the Powerball pot was at $1.5 billion dollars. The biggest prize there had been up to then.
America had lottery fever and we got it too. We scrambled to find the best stories we could about the lottery.
We found the oldest lottery on record.
We talked to the man who beat the odds over and over again and we crunched the numbers on whether or not it is
a good deal to buy a ticket when the pot is as big as it is right now. And the numbers, by the way, back
then, pretty much the same as they are right now. The outcome doesn't change.
So we're leaving those calculations in the show.
Only other thing I have to say is what our producer, Darianne Woods, has put in front of me and made me promise to
read. I solemnly swear to split the pot with Planet Money if we win with this lottery ticket, even though I
bought it with my own money.
OK, with that, here's the episode from 2016.
All right. We have just 24 hours to put this whole show together.
And also I need to know who's in.
I'm in. I'm definitely in.
In. For sure.
I don't want to miss out.
Yeah, you're in. I'm in too.
We're both in. I'm in.
Stacey, you've never bought a ticket before?
Never bought a ticket.
Never?
No, I'm super excited.
I don't even know how to do it.
Who here has bought a lottery ticket before?
I have bought a lottery ticket before.
In fact, I have one right here for the drawing this week.
No way, Robert Smith.
I have it. Don't look at my numbers.
All right, the two of you, buy us a ticket.
I feel like actually we could win.
Like, that is the, that is the mind trick at the center of this.
I feel like we might win.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Rich.
And I'm Robert Smith.
This week, the Powerball lottery is up to 1.5 billion dollars.
Perhaps you have heard.
So like everyone else in the country, we are getting no work done.
We are spending all of our time dreaming.
We have the story of one of the very first lotteries.
The main prize is amazing.
You won't believe it.
And we have the story of the one time it made absolute economic sense to
play the lottery.
And we talked to the guy who pulled it off.
Oh, but first, Stacey, you and I, we got to take care of some business.
All right.
Five numbers here and one number here.
Yeah, okay.

Olympic gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar abused hundreds of women and
girls for more than 20 years before he was caught.
Here how a team of women brought down a serial sexual predator
believed a new podcast for Michigan radio and NPR.
So since we have some time to kill before we quit our jobs, we
thought we would talk about one of the very first times a lottery
existed. And we have David Kestenbaum and Stacey Vanek Smith here to
tell that story.
Can I give you the footnote?
This is the first state lottery that we have good records of.
Oh, as always.
It was a long time ago.
It was 1567.
Wait, 1567?
Really?
Yeah, is in England.
And they have this problem like the harbors are falling apart.
They need money, but everybody hates taxes.
So their finance minister had just been to the Netherlands.
He saw they were trying out lotteries there and it worked well.
And he decided, let's do it in England.
But this was brand new in England.
And so they had to try to figure out how to explain what a
lottery was to people, how to get people on board, and most
importantly, how to sell tickets like a lottery ad campaign.
You may be a winner.
Exactly.
And we talked to David Dean.
He is a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.
And he told us the lottery in England was something like this.
So imagine it is 1567.
You walk into the public market on Saturday and there is a man
shouting, buy lottery tickets.
We know that they have a trumpeter.
Sometimes they put on a little play about, you know, oh, I'm
so poor, I'm so poor, I'm so poor.
Oh my God, I've won the lottery.
Yippee, I'm happy ever after, you know.
That is basically what lottery ads are to this day.
Rich people going like, I can't believe it.
I'm so lucky.
Yeah, like throwing money in the air.
He says they're also in the market.
You would have seen this like big poster that had the official seal
of the government saying you can trust it.
This is for real.
And in the middle of it, there were these pictures of the prizes.
This thing still exists.
And he described it to us.
The prizes are really cool because they show jugs and plates
and they're all gold and silver, but they also have monkeys
holding bags of coins.
And wait until you hear the grand prize.
Whosoever shall win the greatest and most excellent prize
shall receive the value of £5,000 sterling.
That is to say £3,000 in ready money.
That's cash.
£700 worth of plate, gold and white, and the rest in good tapestry
and also a bunch of linen cloth as well.
What is the gold plate?
Is that in like a bar or what does that mean?
No, it would be plates and jugs and chalices.
And plates like to eat off of.
Yeah.
And you would sell that to melt it down or you'd treasure it
on your mantelpiece.
So that's a pretty good grand prize.
I mean, it would be riches beyond everyone's dreams.
He says, here's how it would work.
You would pay 10 shillings to get one lottery ticket
and you would write a poem.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There was a skill part of this?
Well, it's just something to uniquely identify yourself,
you know, in case you won.
He has a whole list of these today.
God is mighty.
May I win or God speed my lot.
And there's some very obscure ones like snakes
meat with garlic is good to eat.
Why didn't people just leave their name?
They don't have the variety of names that we have today.
And there'd be a lot of confusion.
There are a lot of Tom Smith and Robert Smith, Robert Smith.
And their lottery was so much more literary than ours.
I feel like it's so much classier.
They had like criers and everybody wrote poems.
And now we have like a guy with a bunch of ping pong
balls in a vacuum.
Exactly.
Yeah, on TV.
They should absolutely do that today.
Like that is like I want everyone.
You should have to do something in order to get the lottery.
You should have to do a little play or write a poem, sing a song.
What's your poem?
Um, I cannot think of anything funny,
but the winners clearly are Planet Money.
Nice.
That's pretty good.
It's lame rhyme.
He says it's unclear exactly how this works,
but one possibility is like when they pulled out the winning ticket,
they would just read like the first half
and the person who could complete the poem, that would prove it was them.
But he says, despite like the trumpet and all that stuff,
there are not a lot of ticket sales in the early days.
The whole idea of a lottery is just new and people do not trust the government.
You know, they're not sure they're going to get their golden plates.
And another thing is the tickets were expensive.
They're 10 shillings for a carpenter, let's say, in the city of London,
who's a pretty well paid person compared to carpenters elsewhere.
They're earning five shillings a week.
So this would be a fortnight, half your month's salary.
For many people, it would have been the equivalent of a month's salary.
And if you're a laborer or a plowman or something,
you're talking about six months salary.
So a lot of people ended up going in on a lottery ticket together,
exactly like we did.
But they also had another idea to further entice people into buying tickets.
They agreed to not arrest people when they came in to buy tickets.
The idea was like, you know, if you lived out in the country or something
and maybe you'd done something wrong, like you'd stolen a loaf of bread
from somebody, like, don't worry, you can come into town
where you might normally be arrested and we're not going to arrest you.
You can buy a ticket.
Wow. It's kind of like the amnesty.
They have an overdue library books for this one day only.
Give us your money and we won't arrest you.
It says all ticket holders were promised freedom from arrest
for all crimes other than murder, felonies, piracy or treason.
That covers a lot.
It does. It covers a huge amount.
They really, really wanted people to come and buy tickets.
So finally, the big moment comes, right?
Everyone gathers downtown.
It's outside St.
Paul's Cathedral. They're going to pick the winner.
He says he thinks it was probably all the tickets were in a barrel.
And there was one official who pulled out the winner.
And you want to know who the winner is?
We don't know. What? That's the trouble.
We have no idea.
So there's no media coverage of the winner.
No media coverage of the winner at all.
No. In the newspapers of the day.
Nothing. None at all. No.
What he can say is that this lottery was a total failure.
They only sold about one tenth the number of tickets
they were supposed to sell.
And they actually ended up cutting back the prize
to one twelfth of what it had been.
Whoa. Grand prize got cut by that much.
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.
That's I mean, no wonder that's that doesn't seem fair.
And of course, that just reinforced everybody's sense that,
OK, this is a failure and it's not working.
And we will never try it again.
But they did try it again.
Well, they did over 100 years later. Yeah.
So were people smarter back then?
I mean, even back then, people went, I have no chance of winning.
I asked, I said, was it that, you know, they were like,
this is a stupid investment. Why did I do this?
He said, no, no, it was just they didn't trust the government
and it was very, very expensive.
I wonder if they like cut the plates in half or something.
Or you would get a twelfth of a golden plate.
There's somebody eating off those plates right now.
But that's basically how it started.
You know, the trend has been toward bigger and bigger piles of money.
You know, we had first we had the state lotteries
and then someone's like, oh, we can have a much bigger pot with lower odds
if we do a national lottery.
And that's that's what we have today.
That's the one point five billion does not include gold plates.
Thank you, David. You're welcome.
And Stacey, stick around, because we got to do some math.
OK, my favorite subject.
OK, because we're economics reporters,
we have to sort of do the numbers here and show you that this is a
terrible, terrible, terrible financial investment, no matter
how excited we are about it.
The numbers do not work in your favor.
This very quickly back the envelope.
The odds of winning one and two hundred ninety two million.
It cost two dollars for every ticket.
So if you wanted to buy every possible combination,
that would be six hundred million dollars is what it would take.
So if the pot's over six hundred million, then it starts to be worth it.
Yeah, you know, that's not true.
So it's like one point five billion is what you would get over many years.
So if you took the lump sum,
they figure it would be about nine hundred and thirty million dollars.
OK, still pretty good.
But then you have to take away taxes.
You have to pay the highest tax rate on your lottery winnings.
So that would mean you would be left with about five hundred
and sixty one million dollars after you take away federal taxes.
But of course, you and I and the Planet Money team live in New York.
So we would have to pay a city tax and a state tax.
So basically it would whittle down to about five hundred million dollars
would be our lottery winning.
Well, plus we have to split that eight ways.
Yeah, or more, because the big danger for anyone who thinks
they can game the system and play the odds for the lottery
is that you have no control over who else buys your numbers.
We could win with our numbers and somebody else out there
could get the exact same numbers.
But what are the chances of someone picking exactly
the same numbers in exactly the same order?
Well, you know, in order to show this as an economic lesson,
I did do something after you left the corner store that you did not hear.
So let's play that tape. OK, Stacey's left.
So I would like to buy the exact same number again.
But this one's me personally.
I just want to get the same number again.
Same number. Same number.
Ten times same number coming. Same number.
More pay in the tax.
All right. So one of these is mine
and one of these is the rest of the teams.
Robert. Robert.
So let's just say that if our numbers hit,
planet money, of which I'm a member, has to split it
with Robert Smith, the individual Judas.
You just stole millions of dollars from us.
The odds are not good. This is going to happen.
Well, fictional millions.
But still, that makes it worse.
I'm trying to demonstrate
how difficult it is to consider the lottery a sane financial investment.
But when we were doing our research for the show,
we discovered that there was one guy,
there was one guy who managed to figure out how to game this entire system.
And with that story is Planet Money's senior producer, Alex Goldmark.
Hey, Alex. Hi, Robert.
So it's 1992. OK. In Virginia.
And there is a big lottery jackpot for the time.
Twenty seven million dollars.
They pull the numbers. A winner.
And at first, there's nobody who comes forward.
But there are reports that there was something
that was maybe going on before the lottery drawing.
Something suspicious.
It starts to dawn on them that something is up.
Something is different about this lottery drawing. Right.
So first of all, there's these reports from around town.
People had been going into different grocery stores,
buying 50,000 tickets at a time in different combinations.
And they put it all together and they realize that someone or some people
have pulled off what is the dream of all lottery players.
They took the luck out of lottery.
They bought every single combination of numbers possible
and guaranteed themselves a win.
And this is totally perplexing to the people who run the lottery system,
like Ken Thorson, head of the Virginia lottery.
This is him on TV shortly after.
I really never would have imagined that anybody
would have ever wanted to try to buy it out.
It never happened in the United States.
But the very idea of spending over seven million dollars
to buy all the shares in the lottery just seems preposterous.
Because think of what it would take.
I mean, you need investment of seven million dollars.
And then you have to actually go and buy that many lottery tickets.
You're going to be buying tickets 24 hours a day.
You need to fill out each different ticket.
You need to keep track of where each ticket went so that when you win,
you can find the winning ticket.
And yet somebody pulled it off.
Yes. His name is Stefan Mandel.
And I did a little research, poked around and I found him living
on a tropical island in the South Pacific.
Of course he is.
In Vanuatu. Of course.
I made a phone call.
I got his cell phone and I rang him up.
Hello. Hello.
Hi, is this Stefan Mandel?
Yes.
I told him I'm a reporter and that I'm doing a story about lotteries.
Are you willing to talk to me about it for the radio?
That story died a long time ago.
As soon as I started asking him questions, he just could not stop.
He lit up because he's proud that he pulled this off.
And he says, listen, Alex, that Virginia thing,
it took him decades and decades to perfect his system to get to that level.
The story starts in Romania.
In Romania.
Yeah, in the late 1950s.
And Stefan Mandel is working at some job.
He doesn't really like it, an industrial mining company.
And he's got a young wife, young kids, and he just desperately
wants out of the country.
He needs money to do it.
And he starts looking at the lottery.
Well, that was that was the only way that I could get some serious money quickly.
I mean, you know, I was earning at the time
something like 360 lei a month,
which was the equivalent of a good pair of shoes.
You know, but he doesn't just go out and buy random tickets.
He's a pretty natural math whiz.
He goes to the library and he starts reading math paper after math paper
after math paper.
And he comes up with a formula for buying blocks of tickets
that he thinks should guarantee him a prize.
Because he doesn't have enough money to buy every number.
Not yet. OK, he pulls in three friends.
They take their money together.
They still don't have enough money to buy every combination.
But they figure they can guarantee themselves second prize.
We won seventy two thousand seven hundred and eighty three lei,
which was the equivalent of about 18 years of salaries.
All right. Big score.
That was on your first try.
Yeah. Be honest. Was that luck?
Was that luck?
It was luck. OK.
Well, a bit of quite a bit of luck.
Because he was playing for second prize,
but he happened to win first prize.
Nice. Right.
So he takes the money and he leaves Romania,
finally brings his family and they end up in Australia.
And this is where he takes his lottery plan to the next level.
OK, he finds more investors.
He raises more money.
And he this is where he solves what is really the obstacle
to this whole crazy scheme.
Right. Normally, when you want to pick out your own numbers
for the lottery, you go to the corner store
and you ask for that little form with the numbers on it.
And you fill out each little form.
Yeah, with a pencil, it takes forever.
It takes a while.
But he says, no, no, no, no.
I am not going to get caught up in that.
I'm going to automate it.
So he sets up a room filled with printers and a computer program
that is going to spit out those forms already filled out
with every possible combination.
It's going to fill out the forms for him.
At high speed.
So we actually took the paper,
analyzed the chemical composition of the paper ink
and all that sort of stuff.
And we printed out the slips ready with the combinations on them.
Wait, so is this legal to have a computer fill out your slips for you?
It was legal when he did it.
And he turned lottery winning into a business for a while.
In Australia, I won 12 times.
And then I kind of got up their noses a bit.
So they felt that they had to do something about it,
which was ridiculous.
They changed the laws.
First, they passed a law that said no one person can buy
every combination of lottery tickets.
It's just a literally do not do that again law.
And so then he broke it up into 50 different people
who each bought one fiftieth of the numbers.
And so he keeps winning.
And eventually they make enough sufficient laws
that prevent him from doing it again.
But this did not put Stefan out of business.
No, he started looking even bigger.
He starts looking to the US and he looks to a couple of different states.
He starts doing the calculations again.
Because you have to find a place
where the jackpot is big enough to justify all this printing
and all this effort. Right.
So he finds Virginia.
And in Virginia, there are 7.1 million
combinations of lottery tickets.
And he has to wait until the jackpot is.
He figures 25 million or above just to make sure he turns a profit
if there's a split pot.
And then he waits.
He sets up his whole operation for when the time is right.
You know, that's something that you can do in one day.
It took us two months or something, three months.
To print out the numbers?
Yeah, of course.
They printed out all 7.1 million tickets in Australia,
paid $60,000 to ship them to the US,
negotiated bulk buys with grocery stores all around Virginia
about how they could send cashier's checks to buy tens of thousands
of lottery tickets.
I mean, it's like a bank heist how complicated this was.
And I imagine on the night of the Virginia lottery,
he did not have the same feeling that all of us have right now,
awaiting the numbers to come out for the big powerball.
I mean, this guy knew he had it in the bag.
Yeah, when I asked him, were you were you scared?
Were you worried? Were you excited?
He was just like, no, I have all the tickets.
I knew that I would win one first prize, six second prizes,
132 third prizes and thousands minor prizes.
27 million plus all those minor prizes.
Wow, thrown in.
There is a little dispute about whether or not he really bought
all of these tickets or whether he came pretty close,
because there were a few stores who just said, oh, my God,
this is too much.
You have to stop coming in with all these tickets.
In the middle of his buying spree.
But he swears to me that he found workarounds for all of that.
He had backup plans.
And in the end, he did buy all the tickets.
So did he have any advice for anyone who was thinking of doing this
on the scale of powerball, these giant like billion dollar
prices that are coming out now?
It cannot be done anymore.
He says you cannot do it.
The number of combinations have grown too much.
You wouldn't be able to print the tickets.
You wouldn't be able to buy them in time.
And you probably couldn't even do the math right to figure it out
without making a mistake.
So he might be the last guy who is able
to corner the market in the lottery.
The Great Lottery Corner of 1992 will remain the Great Lottery Corner.
All right, Alex, see you on the beach of Vanuatu.
If our numbers come up.
Definitely, Robert.
After the break, the lottery lawyer.

So there is there is one last thing that we wanted to do.
Stacey and I called one man, one man who is almost certain
to profit off of this powerball fever.
So is this the lottery lawyer dot com?
Correct. What's your actual name?
Jason Kerland, K-U-R-L-A-N-D.
And how much did it cost to buy your URL?
I don't remember. It wasn't much. It wasn't much.
Have people found you through that website?
Oh, yeah.
It sounds like this is a much more wise investment
buying lottery lawyer dot com than buying an actual ticket.
Almost any investment is a better investment than buying a lottery ticket.
He's right.
All this fun we've had aside, you really should not buy a lottery ticket.
It's a terrible investment.
Yeah, especially since we don't want to split the pot
any more than we already have to.
Do not buy 10, 11, 51, 52, 62, 18.
