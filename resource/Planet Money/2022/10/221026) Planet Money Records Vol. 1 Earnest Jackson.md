We try to start a real record label. Just to put one song out there. It's a song about inflation, recorded in 1975... and never released. Until now.

Our friends at Planet Money are trying something we thought All Songs listeners might find as fascinating as we do: They're trying to start their own record label to release a single song. It's a song about inflation, recorded in 1975... and never released until now.
