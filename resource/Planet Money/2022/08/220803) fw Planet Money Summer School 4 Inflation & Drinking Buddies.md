Inflation can be one of the scariest forces in the economy. As prices rise and your dollar doesn't go as far, you feel poorer, and it's all out of your control. To better understand inflation, we turn to the story of Brazil, where, in the 90s, hyperinflation threatened to derail the whole economy until the country turned to a group of unlikely heroes: four drinking buddies. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney. |At this Summer School, phones ARE allowed during class...

Inflation can be one of the scariest forces in the economy: Prices rising all around you, decisions grow more confusing, your dollar doesn't go as far, you feel poorer, and it's all out of your control.

We got you.

Inflation is when there is too much money in an economy chasing too free goods and services, and it drives up prices in general. Inflation also undermines our collective confidence in the economy as a whole. When the value of our money is uncertain, it makes our behavior just as uncertain.

For this week's class, we travel to a time and a place where we can see how inflation works crystal clear. We also get to watch what didn't work to stop it, and what eventually did with lessons for today. We go to Brazil, where a decade long bout of hyperinflation threatened to derail one of the largest economies in the world. In their time of great need, the country turned to a band of unlikely heroes: four drinking buddies.

Welcome to Planet Money Summer School, your one-stop shop for learning about all things economic.
I'm Stacey Vanek-Smith and climbing our way out of the caves of macroeconomics,
I'm joined by our two economic spelunkers. I don't know why I wrote it this way, but I did.
Kristin Brody and Luigi Zingales. Hey guys. Hi there. Hi there. This is episode 4 of Summer
School and today's topic is one that is very familiar to most of us. Prices. How much
stuff costs? And this might not sound like such a big deal, kind of small potatoes,
but it is a really big deal because if prices start rising or falling a lot,
it can create a spiral that can destroy a whole economy. One of the big worries
that economists and politicians have about the economy is always inflation,
which is just prices rising across an economy. But specifically people worry about an
inflationary spiral. Kristin Luigi, would one of you mind jumping in and defining
what an inflationary spiral is? I've got the definition. Go Kristin, go. So it's a
situation where price increases and then wages increase because people need more money to be
able to pay the higher prices. And so then we see prices increase again and it just goes
on and on. And this is what is known as the dreaded wage price spiral. So basically prices
start going up, people start asking for higher pay to be able to afford to pay those higher
prices, and then companies start paying out more in wages to their workers. And so they
raise prices on the stuff they sell to help pay for those higher wages, etc, etc. And this
spiral is considered to be a true economic monster when it really gets going. This really
strikes fear into the hearts of economists and politicians. Luigi, why is this? I think that
a high level of inflation, especially unexpected inflation, create a lot of social unrest because
there is a massive redistribution of income in the economy. And that is generally quite
disruptive. So inflationary spiral, if it keeps rising, then you lose confidence the currency
you're using and savings becomes dramatically reduced and long term planning becomes extremely
difficult and so on and so forth. So the disruption in the economy can be substantive,
especially when you enter the double digit inflation range. Or even more than double
digits. So when inflation spirals out of control, it can lead to what is known as
hyperinflation. Hyperinflation is when prices are rising at a rate of a thousand percent
or more per year, which means, for example, that like a three dollar coffee would cost
more than thirty three dollars by the end of one year. And we've never experienced
anything like that in this country. Thank goodness. But countries all over the world
have suffered this. And when it happens, it's just a terribly destructive force. And
we, in fact, are about to hear a story about hyperinflation and the terrible effects
it had on the people and the government of Brazil. Kristen, Luigi, is there anything
that people should listen for with this story? Yeah, it's important just to think
about how much time and how much money had to be invested to come up with different
ways to try to deal with inflation and just how they had people think about the
value of their money so that they didn't lose faith in the economy. The other
thing that I would like them to listen for is this aspect that inflation by a
certain extent is a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the definition of
inflation is a lot of money chasing a limited amount of goods. And if you
expect prices to go up, then you rush to buy the goods today. And that
tends to push the prices up even more. Also, like you say, Luigi, it is
always so fascinating to me the psychological element of inflation,
because one of the ingredients of an inflationary spiral, which is inflation
getting out of control, is people thinking that they're in an inflationary
spiral. And in fact, that is a big part of the story that we are about
to hear. It is about hyperinflation in Brazil from the 80s and 90s. It
was reported by Hanna Jaffe-Walt back in 2010. And we'll hear that right
after the break.

15 years ago, money basically had no value in Brazil. The inflation
rate in Brazil in 1990 was about 80% a month. So imagine just going to
the store, like one day eggs will cost a dollar in the store. And then
tomorrow, they would be $1.02. The next day, they'd be $1.04. By the
end of the month, they would have almost doubled. And by the end of
the year, if inflation continues, eggs would be $1,000. So that was
what things were like in Brazil in the 1980s and the early 90s. And
it is what they would still be like right now today, if it were not for
some unlikely heroes. The most unlikely group of national heroes you
can imagine, four former drinking buddies from grad school, with a
crazy plan who were suddenly put in charge of the country's biggest
economic crisis ever. But before we meet them and hear their story,
let's paint a picture of the problem that they set out to solve. So
remember, prices were going up every day in the 80s and early
90s. And if you think about what that actually means in the
supermarket, they had to change prices every day. Caetano Ferrari,
this flirtatious 75 year old in Sao Paulo that I met, remembers
that that was someone's job to walk the aisles and change the
prices.
There's a guy who changed the sticker. You pass the guy and
you buy things.
Wait, you would walk by the guy, you would like get in front of
him? You run in front of the guy and buy things like that.
So that you could get to the goods before he changed the price.
Yes, like that.
Inflation was a pain for people who shopped in stores as
well as for people who ran those stores. Because the problem
is you can only possibly know that inflation was 80% a month
in retrospect. At the time it's actually happening, you have
no idea. This is one of the pernicious effects of sustained
high inflation. You assume because prices were going up in
the past that they're going to continue going up in the
future. But you don't really know how much. How much do you
tell the sticker man to raise prices by? So every business
in Brazil had to develop different strategies. So some
people just set a number for what prices will be. They just
said prices will go up 2% every day. Other store owners
would go and just peek at the store down the road and
see what their prices were and copy them. And others
would look at the exchange rate with the dollar. So people
like Isaac Gwerkman, he ran a textile factory in a row of
textile businesses. And his method was looking at the
exchange rate with the dollar combined with good old
fashion collusion. Every morning Isaac would get
together with the other textile guys.
In Brazil it's very common that you start your day
having a glass of coffee. And we start out the weekend and
how our football team has has done. And then someone
probably would say, how much are you going to start? Are
you going to charge? What is the dollar exchange rate? And
somebody else would say was nine now at $10. So I have
to increase my prices 10%. And you know, it's not an
exactly science.
Brazil's problems with inflation all started in the
1950s. The government wanted to build a new capital in
Brasilia and they wanted nice buildings, fancy architects
and didn't have the savings to pull it off. So it
created the money to do it. Now this is an option
countries are often tempted to take. They can print money
to pay for things they can't afford. The problem of
course is inflation. So if there's $100 in the economy
and you create 100 more, now every dollar is worth
half as much. That's inflation. And in Brazil, inflation
continued for the next five decades. Year after year,
Brazilian money was worth less and less. And this
causes all sorts of problems, not just with the
sticker man. You know, say you get $1,000 bonus and
you put that money in your drawer. A year later, it's
worth half as much. So the minute you get paid, the
clock is ticking on your money. I talked to one man
who told me he used to have nightmares about his
money sitting still on his dresser, just losing
value. A beer manufacturer told me he stopped making
beer because making beer just takes too long. You
buy all the grains and hops. And by the time it
was brewed, everything was worth so much less.
So by the 1980s, inflation was the number one
political issue. And so began the plans to fix
it. Now, it turns out the best person to talk
to about this is Maria Leopoldina Birrenbeck.
Because Maria can take you through a detailed
history of each president's failed plan to stop
inflation. But you have to ask Maria each
question twice, because the first time she always
answers like this.
I don't know, because I never had to do
anything. I was just a plain housewife mother.
And then Maria will proceed to be the most
knowledgeable person you will speak to on any
topic. OK, so first up, President Sarnay in
1985. And President Sarnay's solution to
inflation was simple. Businesses are raising
prices. Make that illegal. There was a price
freeze.
And you know what happened? People hid the
merchandise and you couldn't buy anything
because they wanted the prices to grow up
because the situation was a fantasy. It was
not real. You couldn't find the meat at the
butchers because they weren't they just
weren't buying meat to sell. Why couldn't
they hid the cattle? Really? Yes, you can
do that here. It's a very large country.
So they hid the cattle waiting for the
price freeze to go away.
The main problem with this plan, of course,
is you can't just freeze prices and not
deal with the underlying problem. The fact
that the government is still creating money,
which causes inflation. So that was the
next guy's idea. President Caller in 1990.
He thought, OK, I'll just stop creating so
much money. Inflation will eventually go
down. Now, here is the problem with that.
It has to do with the country's banks.
If you were in the small minority of
Brazilians who had enough money to have
a bank account, it felt like a really
great deal because in order to get your
money, banks had to pay you an interest
rate that was higher than the rate of
inflation. So in the U.S., you're lucky
if you get 2% interest on your bank
account. But in Brazil in 1990, people
could get 2000% or more.
Money was growing in banks, which
helped fuel inflation, which led
President Caller to believe bank
accounts were part of the problem.
And here's where he went really,
really wrong. He decided to freeze
bank accounts, 80% of private assets,
80% of the money you have in your
bank account, you can't take out.
Now, Maria is telling me this and my
translator, Flavio Ferreira, was
sitting in on our conversation and he
could no longer keep quiet.
He remembers when the Minister of
Finance made that announcement.
And I remember the day when she was
on TV explaining that they were
going to confiscate everybody's
money. So next day banks would not
work. I remember the face of that
woman. She had studied in the best
schools and she had been a professor
at USP and she was explaining to the
nation as an economist why we need
this to end inflation. We need the
country to be, you know, together
with us. But I remember I look at
her and said, God, a government
cannot do that. I mean, when a
government does that, you lose, you
lose people's respect.
Oh, it was terrible, wasn't it?
It was terrible. So many people
committed suicide, you know.
When you mess with people's money,
it does not go well.
The economy went off a cliff.
President Culler was impeached.
There was a new president, a new
finance minister, and inflation
went back up again.
The Brazilian economy was at a
low point and it looked like there
was nothing to be done to fix it.
Enter our heroes, those four
economists we talked about at the
beginning, who basically entered the
picture now because that new
finance minister knew nothing about
economics. And so in March of
1993, he called one of our
heroes, Edmar Bacha.
Oh, I was, I was, I was in my
office at that university here, the
Catholic University.
And I got a call soon after I had
finished teaching a class, you
know, and he said, well,
I've just been named the finance
minister.
You know that I don't know any
economics, so please
come to meet me in Brasilia
tomorrow.
We need you.
Well, I was terrified.
Bacha had been waiting three
decades for this call ever since
he and his three friends had
taught graduate school together
at the prestigious Catholic
University in Rio.
Four friends who had been
studying Brazilian inflation for
decades. Four buddies at
the campus bar complaining to
each other about how this
government didn't know what it
was doing and that government
didn't know what it was doing.
Four buddies who are now being
asked by the government to
come and fix things their
way, the plan they'd spent
years on.
And so, of course, their
first answer.
No, we don't want to.
Here's another one of the four,
Andre Lara.
This is a, this is a process.
It's something that requires many
years. It's not something that we
can do. It's not a magic.
It's not a trick that we do
overnight.
The government pressed on.
Lara and Bacha were taken to
dinner with members of
parliament who told them how
much the country really needed
them. They got calls at home.
Senators told them, you will
have free rein, whatever you
think is best.
Bacha was invited to meet the
president.
And then I asked him on
autograph for my kids.
And then he wrote
a note, a note for
address to my two kids and
saying, please tell your
father to work fast
for the benefit of the country.
That's what he wrote in the
autograph?
Yes, yes, I still have that
note.
So there was a lot of
pressure.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Bacha was eventually won over
by the autograph and the
finance minister's appeals.
And Lara was convinced by a
parliamentary dinner where the
politicians assured him they'd
take whatever difficult measures
were needed to keep his idea
pure.
So here was the idea.
Basically, the four economists
said, yes, you have to hit the
underlying causes of
inflation. You have to stop
creating money, but you also
have to stabilize people's
faith in money itself.
And this is where their
plan was different.
People were part of the
problem, they thought,
their perceptions.
People had to be tricked
into thinking money had value
when all signs told them
that was absolutely not
true.
So Bacha says they wrote a
plan for a new currency,
one that was stable, dependable,
trustworthy.
The only catch was this currency
would not be real.
It would not be printed.
There would never be coins.
It was fake.
They called it a virtual
currency.
We call the unit of real
value,
URV.
Yeah, it was a virtual.
It didn't exist, in fact.
People would still have and
use Cruceros, the local
currency, but everything
would be listed in URVs.
Your wages would be listed in
URVs, taxes were listed
in URVs, and all prices
in the stores were listed in
URVs.
And URVs would be held
stable.
And so, for example, when
you went to the store and
bought some milk.
How much does it cost?
Say, well, now we have it
costs X, let's say,
one URV.
Well, how much is that?
Because I cannot pay with our
URV. So, well, I have this
little table here and today's
value of URV in Cruceros
is seven
Cruceros per URV.
So it costs one URV, seven
Cruceros. You pay seven
Cruceros. You go next
week. Well, it's still
one URV.
But then you say, how many
Cruceros? You look.
Well, it's 14.
Every night, the central bank
would put out a memo with
the official inflation rate
of the day and it would get
printed in the newspaper the
next morning.
So the store clerk could look
it up. Monday, one URV
is equal to seven Cruceros.
Tuesday, 12 Cruceros.
Wednesday, 14.
Milk or whatever it was you
were buying would stay the
same in URVs.
And the idea was you would
start thinking in the fake
currency in URVs because
just last week you got
paid a thousand URVs.
Milk costs one URV.
Next month, you get a
thousand URVs again and
milk would still be one
URV.
The amount of Cruceros,
what you actually handed to
the clerk would change.
But the price in URVs
would not.
That was the plan which
Bacha presented to the
senator from Sao Paolo.
And then when I explained
to him the plan, you know,
he after a while,
you know, he said, well,
with some anguish in his
voice said, well, Bacha,
if this is the only way
that you tell me that it
can be done, then we'll
follow you to the precipice.
And so the four economists
went about explaining to
the country that everyone
now should talk in a
virtual currency.
We didn't understand what
it was.
We asked, how much is
that? Oh, so many URVs.
I used to say it was a
fantasy because it was
not real.
Still, people used it
without being forced to.
One store would be selling
milk for one URV and
eventually all the stores
would be. So people would
know that's an appropriate
price for milk, which I
can tell because I got
paid one thousand URVs.
And then when we are
satisfied that prices
were relatively in good
synchrony, we declare,
well, from this day,
the virtual currency
becomes a real currency.
The cruzeiro real is
going to disappear
and everyone is going
to receive from now on
its wages and pay all
for all the prices in
the new currency, which
is the real, which is
equal to one URV
and also equals to
one dollar.
And that is the trick.
It wasn't the only
trick, obviously.
While they put URVs
in place, the group of
economists made the
government balance its
budget and slow down
on money creation.
And then one day,
July 1st, 1994, the
central bank deployed
truckloads of new cash
in this new currency,
the real, to banks in
the cities, to provinces,
and waited on the ready
for the four economists
to say, go.
All that fake money
you've been using,
it's now real.
And I remember, you know,
the day, the day that
we launched in the real,
I have this journalist
who had become a friend
of mine.
And then she came to me
and said, the professor,
do you swear that
inflation is going to end
tomorrow?
I said, yes, I swear
that's going to end
tomorrow.
Everybody was very happy.
Our four heroes literally
turned Brazil's economy
in the opposite direction
with their plan.
Brazil was finally able
to grow in the way
it always should have been
all along.
The country was able
to grow true
competitive industries,
huge players in sugar
and oil and iron ore.
And Cardoso,
the finance minister
who hired our four heroes
after admitting he knew
nothing about economics.
He was elected president
twice.
That was Hanna Jaffe
who walked back in 2010.
And we will be back
after a short break
to slow walk through
exactly how these economists
solved the problem
of hyperinflation in Brazil.
We're back with our economist
extraordinaire,
Luigi and Kristen.
What did you guys think?
Like what went through your head
while you were
listening to this story?
It takes me back to
when I was working
on my master's degree.
I worked at Circuit City,
which has now gone on.
But one of the things
that that was our job
on Saturday or Sunday,
one of those days,
we would update the prices.
It wasn't about inflation.
You did the price.
You were the pricing person.
Yes. Oh, my gosh.
So it wasn't
drastic swings.
It was just based on
whatever the price was.
Some of the prices
of televisions or stereos
or whatever it was
would go up or down.
And there would be customers
if they were in the store
at the time of the price change.
You know, they may want to make
a purchase before the price went up,
where they may want to wait
to see if it went down.
Well, yeah,
I mean, it's a less fraught version
of the price changing
than we saw like in the grocery store.
But it's the same thing, right?
It's people who want to make sure
they're getting the best deal.
And in the case of Brazil,
when we heard that sort of price
changing was just very emotional.
It came with a lot of panic
and a lot of fear.
And that was really like part of
what these four Brazilian
economists were up against.
I think that the cleverness
of these four guys,
because it's pretty clear
for the episode that in order
to bring down inflation
and to stabilize the price level,
you need to intervene
on the money printing.
But at the same time,
you need to change the expectations
and changing the expectations
is something that
we don't really know
how to do as an economist.
And in a sense,
you have this concept
of rational expectation
that people should behave
like we think the model behaves.
That's not really
what happens in the world.
You need to
make something credible.
And this is where
psychology comes into picture.
And ironically,
these four economists
were very good
empirical psychologists
at the same time as they were doing
the right thing economically,
because in the episode,
there was one of the four
economists that said
that it was asked by a friend,
can you promise
that inflation will not go up?
And and he said, yes, I promise.
Yes, that is such a striking moment.
Yeah, because I actually
hold promises in very high regard.
I only promise what I know
I can deliver 100 percent.
And I think he promised when he knew
he could deliver maybe 98 percent.
And it worked.
But two percent of the time,
you're really a bastard.
So I'd love to kind of
like do a little bit of a slow
walk through what happened here.
So these economists,
they make up a currency.
They peg the Brazilian
currency to this currency
that they say is made up.
It doesn't exist.
How did this work?
Yeah. So I think it's like
they talked about in the episode
the price of milk, for instance.
Yeah. Right.
That that if milk costs one
UVI, right, that each time
you go to the store
day after day, week after week,
it's it's one UVI.
So you feel like the price
isn't changing.
OK, things are stabilizing, right?
So everything has a UVI price.
But I guess it's interesting to me
because the amount of currency
that you actually have
to turn over is changing.
Yes, yes.
So it's basically like the
oh, like the going to the grocery
store, because Kristen,
you you mentioned like milk
every time it's one UVI.
And that's such a contrast
to the opening scene
where this guy is like
basically speedwalking
down the aisles,
changing all the prices
where every the price
is changing, changing.
It creates stability,
even if that stability is fake.
It's like a fake stability.
I think they set
the expectation differently.
You need to to converge if
this is a need to coordinate,
because if I am the only one
not rushing to buy
the good tomorrow
and everybody else does,
I basically get my value
depreciated, my money
depreciated, and you don't.
So in fear that you are running
and I'm not,
I'm going to run myself.
And that's a situation
that is very dangerous
because everybody say,
OK, I believe it
when I see it happening.
But before I'm going
to rush and buy my stuff.
The moment you see that
actually the other people
are coming down
is a bit like in the famous
Frank Capra that you see
the run to the bank.
I've never really seen one,
but that's got all the air
marks of being a run.
Oh, yeah, it's a wonderful life.
It's a wonderful life.
It's such an amazing movie.
And yeah, there's this
there's a moment in the movie
where there's this
people, everybody's panicking
and they run into this bank
and they're all trying
to get their their money out
right away. They're panicking.
But George, I got my money here.
You're thinking of this place
all wrong as if I had the money
back on a safe.
The money's not here.
Like the money's in your house,
in your house, in yours.
Yeah.
And in the Kennedy house
and Mrs.
Mikelin's house
and a hundred others.
Exactly, exactly.
And that helps calm down people.
And it's not easy to do it
even in a small town
like what's the name?
Oh, Bedford Falls.
It's not even easy
to do in Bedford Falls,
but in a country as large
and diverse as Brazil,
you really find it hard
for anybody to believe
anybody else.
Yeah, I think that
that people want to believe
they want to know that
money is going to be stable,
that their earnings
are going to be able to buy
the amount of goods
and services that they expect
and that their accumulated wealth
is going to continue to be worth
whatever it's worth over time.
People don't want to know
that the money that they worked for
or the wealth that they accumulated
is going to be able to buy less
in the future.
That's not a comfortable thought.
And inflation does erode
the value of dollars, right?
So people want to know
that their money is going to hold some value,
whether it's for retirement,
whether it's for buying things
in the future.
They don't want to think
that they've done all of this work
and saved all of this money
and that the money
is going to be worthless.
All right, everybody,
we are almost to the end of class.
Time to go over our vocabulary
and our concepts.
I remember there is a test
at the end of summer school.
And if you pass,
you will get a genuine diploma.
Can't put a price on that.
So we have got inflation.
The definition of inflation
is prices rising across an economy.
There's also the wage price spiral.
That is when prices rise
and then people demand higher pay
to pay those higher prices
and then companies raise their prices
to be able to afford those higher wages
and up and up and up.
There is hyperinflation
and that is when prices are rising
by more than 1000% a year.
Before I let you guys go,
we have our Spotify playlist,
Econ Songs for the Summer.
Are there any songs
that came into your mind
as you were listening to this tale
of prices and inflation
and policy change?
I'm trying to think
that there is an Italian song
of somebody going to the beach
and paying always high
and higher prices for everything
and couldn't afford to do it
because unlike Christine,
I'm much older,
so I do remember the time
of two digit inflation in Italy.
And that was a pain.
Oh, it looks like we found the song.
It's called Ami Piace Il Mare
or I Like the Sea.
It's a song from 1969
about prices rising.
They especially talk
about the price of ice cream rising.
Apparently it went from 100 lira
to 1000 lira.
