This episode, Micro-Face: The Musical. A full concert recording of a one-of-a-kind Planet Money superhero musical, taped during our recent live show at the Roulette Theater in Brooklyn, New York.

Trisha Pickelhaupt/NPR

May 10, 2022. A sold-out Roulette Theater in Brooklyn, New York. It was a night of economics, superheroes, and musical theater. You could call it the Infinity Gauntlet of joyous nerdom (we did).

You could also call it the world premier of Micro-Face: The Musical — a the one-of-a-kind Planet Money superhero musical written and directed by Kit Goldstein Grant, an award-winning, international musical theater composer and librettist.

Lucky for us, Kit is also a Planet Money listener who was inspired by our project to buy and monetize a superhero. That superhero, of course, is Micro-Face. Kit's story of 'the sonic superhero that the world will soon embrace' picks up after our Micro-Face comic book takes place, drawing inspiration along the way from past Planet Money episodes.

Here's more from our project We Buy A Superhero.

Mike Peska of The Gist calls the new podcast Landslide compelling and eye-opening.
A must listen says podcast the newsletter about Landslide.
The New Yorker writes, terrific.
The state of the union is not good.
Landslide, the story of how a party and the nation shifted to the right.
Part of the NPR network.
Listen now wherever you get your podcasts.
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Hello, I'm Amanda Aronchik.
I am Kenny Malone.
Kenny, it is a big day.
Biggest day, yes.
Biggest day.
Because we at Planet Money have been hard at work,
lighting the lights, setting the stage,
getting ready to share with you, audience,
Planet Money's first original production of Microface the Musical.
Now if you subscribe to Planet Money Plus,
you got a chance to hear this a few weeks ago,
and now we are sharing it with everybody.
Yes, this is very exciting.
Kenny, I think we need to take a few minutes
to set up the musical for people, right?
Yeah, it is a complicated musical.
It's a complicated musical.
It will take a second.
Okay, so this musical grew out of the Planet Money project,
We Buy a Superhero,
and we have done a bunch of episodes about the superhero.
We will link to them in our episode notes.
And basically this was a project to buy and monetize a superhero
in order to understand the high stakes economic world
of superhero intellectual property.
Yeah, because of course superhero IP fuels movies
and merchandise and theme parks.
It's huge and it's interesting,
and we wanted to understand it from the inside and out,
and so to do that, we actually first went out
and tried to buy a superhero off of Marvel Comics.
That did not work out.
We did find, kind of laying in the sort of dumpsters
of history, an old forgotten superhero
from the 1940s that nobody owned anymore named Microface.
So Microface's superpowers are super sensitive hearing,
X-ray kind of vision.
He has this microphone amplified voice
that will sort of appear to be coming from anywhere.
Microface!
There we go.
That's the voice of Microface.
Most important thing about Microface,
aside from the awesome name and the amazing super talents,
is Microface was in the public domain.
Which allowed us at Planet Money
to acquire-ish Microface by basically
just rebooting the character,
putting a little more of a spin on him.
We actually took away a few of his abs
from the original version,
gave him a slightly different costume.
But yeah.
Did you say abs?
Yeah, abs.
Like actual, interesting.
Abdominal, he was very shredded
in the original comic book in the 1940s.
Okay, very good.
This new rebooted version, we could own that version,
and so that let Planet Money license him out,
create merch, a comic book.
We shopped him around to see
if anybody wanted the movie rights,
and then we sort of jokingly said,
hey, does anybody wanna license this character
for a musical?
And that is when we heard from Kit Goldstein Grant.
So I love writing musicals
about weird, specific things.
Now, Kit is a very real musical writer.
She studied at Julliard.
She had also been listening to our show,
and during COVID, when theaters were shut down,
she was out on a walk in Queens where she lives,
and she says this song just came to her.
It's time for Microface.
It's time for Microface.
The sonic superhero that the world will soon embrace.
With this invention I could spread omnidirectional good.
Yeah.
So, long story short, we at Planet Money and at NPR,
we licensed Microface to Kit
so that she could write a musical.
A musical that was, in fact, amazingly performed
and recorded just a few months ago
as part of a live show that we did in Brooklyn, New York.
Now, this was a concert performance
of Microface, the musical,
which means that there was a full band.
There were incredibly talented performers singing
and acting, but there were not sets.
There were not costume changes.
This was meant to be listened to first and foremost.
So you're not gonna miss anything
by not being able to see what's going on on stage.
However, it does require a little bit of information
to fully comprehend the plot of this wonderfully
dorky, nerdy, economic-sy musical.
And the first thing that you're gonna need
to understand comes from an old Planet Money episode
called S. Sheet Show.
In that episode, we explained that S. Sheet
is this economics concept
that dates all the way back to feudal England
and is essentially the government's ability
to take possession of unclaimed financial assets
on behalf of its citizens.
So stocks, paychecks, bank accounts, anything like that.
Right, it's kind of like a giant lost and found
run by the government, right?
So each state has its own system.
You can actually go and look up your own name
and see if perhaps, I don't know,
you have a utility credit left over from somewhere
or a bank account that you thought you closed.
And maybe that state owes you some money.
Everyone should go do this.
I have found at least $40 in missing paycheck
from NPR, actually.
I actually found, I got 90 bucks.
So we both have benefited from looking up our names.
One of our listeners found $24,000 sitting unclaimed.
Amazing.
So this is worth doing.
But what all of this has to do
with the Microface musical is that the government
gets to use your money while they're holding onto it.
And so the sort of other side of this is that
is it really in the government's best interest
to return all of this money to people?
So this is the idea that evil genius composer
Kit Goldstein Grant was playing with.
That's thing number one.
Thing number two that you need to know
before we play this for you
is something we've mentioned in episodes before.
It is a programming language,
a computer programming language called COBOL,
and it is this old like 1950s computer language
that was used by the government
to make databases and applications.
But because COBOL is still the underlying code
for a lot of government stuff, it breaks down.
And you have to go like find these people
who remember how the language works to fix it.
And you have to like drag them back in
to save the day.
Those are the things you're gonna need to know.
COBOL, old language, S-sheet,
a thing that the government does that in theory is nice,
but could be warped into something, maybe evil.
And I think that's everything people need to know.
Correct, Amanda?
I think so.
Although before we get there,
we should probably tell people
just how lyrical the musical is.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I do think one of the composer Kit Goldstein
Grant's superpowers here is her ability to write lyrics.
And so what I would recommend is
these songs are really, really dense.
So I would listen to this if you can
with headphones, loudspeakers.
Listen somewhere where you can really take this in
and appreciate it and listen to the lyrics.
There are so many jokes
and planet money references in this.
Like it is the most planet money thing
that has ever been made.
And we didn't make it.
We didn't make it.
A super listener made it.
But yeah, okay.
I think that is everything
that people are gonna need to know.
And with that, we now present Microface the Musical
written and directed by Kit Goldstein Grant
after this short break.

Okay, without further ado,
I am unfathomably excited to present the world premiere
of Microface the Musical.
Our story begins with a flashback.
NPR business reporter Sam Salazar
has just received a mysterious letter
accompanied by a box.
Let's drop in and find out what's inside.
To my grandson Sam, if you're holding this letter,
it means you've figured out by now
that I was not only your loving abuelo,
but also the golden age superhero Microface.
I spent a good chunk of my younger years
using the special audio powers in my helmet
to try to keep the streets safe.
But now, it's your turn.
Take care of this suit and helmet.
They are my last legacy.
And always remember what I told you so many times
when you would get beat up at school.
Life is about speaking up, being heard,
using your voice to help yourself and others.
If you see injustice, be the one who speaks up.
Be careful son, and make sure you
get out there and kick asset.
Microface.
Equity has been taken down by the newest superhero
on the economics beat, the mysterious Microface.
Remember, his head's not tiny,
he has a microphone in his helmet.
You're listening to NPR News.
Great show today, Amina.
It hasn't aired yet.
Were you listening?
Why have a mask with special powers of hearing
if you don't have some fun with it?
Don't be a creeper, tiny head.
The name is Microface.
Your dead abuelo left you that microphone suit
he invented so you could listen in on my broadcasts.
Come on, I've only had it a few days.
Sure, I've already used it to break up
a malicious private equity firm.
But I've got more gizmos to try out.
I'm still working on the manual he sent.
Did you know it has photoelectric vision
so I can see through stuff?
Yeah, you told me.
And I can throw my voice any place
within a full 20-mile radius.
This suit just keeps getting better and better.
Come on, Amina, let's get out of here
and go find some punks to take down.
You know, you do still have a job, Sam.
You're a business reporter.
You can't just be running around the streets
beating up bank robbers like some kind of vigilante.
I know, I know.
But my grandpa wouldn't have left me this super suit
if he didn't want me to do something with it.
I've gotta get out there.
Do you even know how cool this suit is?
How much stuff I can do?
I can whisper softly and you hear it all around.
I can play a bass that rumbles, rumbles through the ground.
Throw my voice and tell those robbers,
hands up in the air.
They run the other way and then I catch them
in my snare.
It's time for Microface.
It's time for Microface.
The sonic superhero that the world will soon embrace.
With this invention I could
spread army direction all good.
Are you serious, Sam?
So serious.
With great audio processing power
comes great responsibility.
Set my levels high and hear the misbehaviors yelp.
Soon the FBI and cops are calling me for help.
As the villains think their vicious planning is complete
I send a wave of sound so loud
it knocks them off their feet.
It's time for Microface.
It's time for Microface.
For Mac or macro crimes you bet
I'm always on the case.
With this invention I could
spread army direction all good.
It's time for Microface.
My panning and compression leaves the villains in disgrace.
With this invention I could
spread army direction all good.
For Microface.
I've got actual work to do.
Find another sidekick.
Shh.
Wait a second.
Are you eavesdropping again?
Is it something good?
No, it's, I just heard my aunt's name.
Your tia Eleanor?
I think it's coming from the building over.
Hold on, take this microbud.
Who the heck is Eleanor Wood?
Who cares, throw it out.
This is so weird.
I'm always getting mail from
the New York State Comptroller's Office
for like thousands of different people
but they all have my address.
I've been getting them ever since I moved in.
Always for different people.
It's like their system is really screwed up.
And now I've got one more for some Eleanor Wood.
Dude, shred it, let's roll.
The game's about to start.
Yeah, I guess.
It just sucks that some people
aren't getting their mail.
So weird.
I've got to check this out.
Sam, you've got a life.
You can't just get involved with stuff
because you hear your aunt's name.
I've got to find out what's going on.
Are you in or are you out?
Oh, fine, I'm in.
But no more eavesdropping, okay, tiny head?
The name is.
Yeah, I know.
Come on, Amina.
Let's go raid a recycle bin.
If letters reach the wrong address,
I put them in their place.
Get ready.
For my growth phase.
Push enough buzzers and someone will let you in.
What now?
Find the recycle bin and start looking.
Got it.
What's left of it?
Wait, there's a lot of them.
Oh.
Letters from the state controller's office.
Oh, here's one that's not shredded.
You're going to open it?
You know that's mail fraud.
All right, all right.
I'll use my photoelectric vision to look inside.
Looks like a check.
It's a state tax refund.
Could they all be tax refunds?
But why would all these tax refunds
be going to the same address?
I don't know, but I'd better find out.
My aunt never got her refund
and she's going to be evicted next week
if she can't pay her mortgage.
She still lives in the house she grew up in
with my grandpa and it'll just kill her
to lose that place.
Evicted?
What's going on?
When Golden Age private equity took over
Wood family inventions, she got laid off.
And she's been having a lot of money problems since.
A tax refund could really make a difference to her.
Why don't you just send her a check?
I work at a non-profit, remember?
Wait a second.
Look at this envelope.
There's something written in tiny print on the inside.
This one has it too.
They all have it.
Back the code of the cracked code.
Tuesday, 2 p.m.
Benny Z. Pallone State Office Building.
Look for a computer programmer with nerdy glasses.
But beware, danger lurks.
But that's today.
We better move it.
Should we go?
It could be a trap.
It could also be a clue.
We've got to go for your aunt's sake.
It's time for micro-
We're statistic.
Not sure what we do here.
Well, I'll cash it.
Then the state is gonna be trusted
as nothing sweeter as cheater.
Your job title is spelled as cheater.
But I thought it was pronounced as cheater.
Not in my case, honey.
Those duckets, nice and cozy.
We'll keep your money-
Notices out to people to let them know
that we have their money?
Notices?
You ever heard of Google?
That you never got paid?
All you gotta do is think of searching
unclaimed funds New York State
and then enter your information on a website
that may or may not be currently undergoing maintenance.
See?
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
Keep your money safe.
To invest in in-state projects
like an Erie Canal cruise line, of course.
Of course.
But you get my drift.
Are you in or are you out?
Want to buy a suite to see-
State building, Sam.
Be careful.
This place is crawling with reporters.
Wouldn't want your secret identity to get out.
Test, test, one, two, three.
What's going on?
Looks like an event.
Press conference, I suppose?
Weird.
So the note said to look for someone in nerdy glasses.
See anyone in nerdy glasses?
I mean, press conference, reporters.
It's kind of the dress code.
But does anyone look like a computer programmer?
Keep looking.
No questions, no questions yet.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen of the press.
Today, I am delighted to announce
that due to higher than expected revenue
in our general fund,
New York State's budget is now officially balanced.
Any questions?
Yes, sir.
Yes, yes, sir.
Sir, are you wearing diamond cufflinks?
That's enough questions.
This press conference is over.
No, yes.
There's something fishy about this.
Oh, look at that woman.
Her glasses are pretty nerdy.
Yeah, that's gotta be the programmer.
Hi, I saw a tiny message in a refund check.
Does that mean anything to you?
How did you see it?
Are you the microface?
Shh, not so loud.
Do you have information for me?
Ha, do I have information?
I program in COBOL.
I was called out of retirement
to update the Department of Labor system
and then transferred to the Bureau of Lost Monies.
They told me to keep my head down
and stay in my own lane,
but I don't believe in lanes,
except on the freeway.
Go on.
The website was always having issues
or undergoing maintenance,
and if a reporter caught wind of it,
then the old broken COBOL
was always a convenient patsy.
But I started poking around the code,
and I figured out what was really going on.
There's a jumble in the Java,
there's a Python on the loose,
causing errors that would make a user cuss.
And they always blame the COBOL,
COBOL's always the excuse,
but there's trouble in the C++.
When the site is barely loading
or there's error 404,
they go throwing COBOL underneath the bus.
But I process all my data,
I won't take it anymore,
because there's trouble in the C++.
There's corruption in the code
and sin in the syntax
that attacks the tax department, too.
The letter's misdirected,
well then everybody shrugs,
and they think there's nothing rotten to discuss.
But the problem's really basic,
there's a blaggard building bugs,
and there's trouble in the C,
trouble in the C++.
The system is fixed,
but I could fix the system.
In the first case you mean fixed like grigged,
and in the second you mean fixed like corrected, right?
Right.
I knew you were the only one who could help.
I've been including messages
inside the envelopes ever since,
knowing only you could see them
with your photoelectric vision.
But why take the risk?
Surely not just to avenge COBOL's good name.
I was an old friend of Tom Wood,
the original Microface.
He must have been your grandpa, right?
I couldn't stand by and watch
what was happening to his daughter, Eleanor.
I got the corrected code right here on my BlackBerry,
ready to go at a moment's notice.
Push a button to deploy it,
and the typos disappear.
And to get your dough,
it won't cost you any fuss.
I've been coding for a lifetime.
This could cancel my career,
but I see it as my public duty.
Change the Perlin-
Yes, plot.
But who's behind it?
Who would benefit from a malfunctioning
lost money's computer system and website?
See that building over there?
Look into it.
Oh, gotcha.
That's where I'll start my investigation.
No, you have photoelectric vision, don't you?
Look into it.
And use your super strong hearing, too.
Amina, I've got to wear my helmet.
Cover me.
Gonna cheer me up after that disaster.
The lost money's guy who just gave the press conference.
Mr. Diamond Sleeve.
And his assistant, shh.
Champagne and caviar pate is disgusting.
Oh, it's so expensive, my love.
With my share of the take,
a 15-second clip of a sports game,
which is also freely available on YouTube,
isn't all it's cracked up to be.
There's more to my plan than fish eggs
and non-fungible tokens.
And now that the budget is balanced
and we have everything we want,
it's time for stage two.
One of the people who didn't get her money
was Eleanor Wood.
You know who she is?
No idea.
She's the daughter of Tom Wood,
inventor of the microface suit.
She still lives in the old family house,
a house that must be filled
with Tom Wood's other hidden inventions.
And if she doesn't get her state tax refund,
she's going to be evicted.
Which is our chance to swoop in
and get all the cool gear that he came up with?
How fast you learn, my wicked fledgling.
Those inventions can be used as weapons.
Once we have them in our hot little hands, Tiffany,
the sky's the limit.
Ultimate power.
I could be governor.
You could be queen.
No one could stop us.
The Ashiter, he's the one behind all of this.
Hey, where did that programmer go?
I must have seen her talking to us.
They've got her blackberry with the corrected code.
We've got to get it back.
I'll have to use the suit.
Got you now.
Amina, tie him up.
Last we meet, microface.
Or should I say, Sam Salazar.
How did you?
My henchmen saw you talking to Cathy.
I was worried she'd go soft.
She always was a weak link.
So Sam, I hear you're an NPR reporter.
Not for long.
When I tell your boss about your secret identity,
you'll be donezo.
And your tia, she'll never get the money the state owes her.
Ha ha ha.
Where's the rest of them?
How did they find me?
It was me all along.
Now, time to check the plosive powers of this mask.
No, no.
Sam, you knocked him out cold.
I'll get the blackberry back.
It's the website's code.
Hit go.
Done.
Now people can actually search for their unclaimed funds.
But we need people to know to go on to the website
and claim their money.
If only we knew somebody with a really loud face.
To the entire state of New York?
With the suit, I could throw my voice
into the homes of everyone in New York City.
Maybe not the whole state.
We could rig up the suit to that WNYC radio transmitter.
We're right by the transmitter building.
That would increase the power.
Would that work?
I'm talent, not tech.
But we might as well try.
I'll hack into the transmitter system.
Hand me that wire.
Sam, you get that helmet ready to go.
Turn the volume to 11.
It doesn't clip overhead room.
And the levels mustn't dip.
No matter the distortion, we've got to take the floor
and spread our podcast to the world louder than ever
before.
And in town, we'll blast the news to Buffalo Monroe.
Because it's the people's money.
Clear my throat or God forbid I cough.
They'll hear us from the Hamptons to Saratoga track.
Because it's the people's money.
And it's time they take it.
So if I blow my eardrums out or break the mask in two,
I'll know that it was worth it.
It's what I got to do.
The world will shake at the city rock.
I'll be so super loud.
But it's not enough.
We can't turn up the input.
The levels will spike.
And it'll distort so much that nobody
will understand what I'm saying.
According to the manual, we need
to get your inest possible level right before it becomes
too distorted to understand.
You have to speak at exactly the volume we test at
or we'll lose our only chance.
Can you do it?
Let's see how good of a radio reporter I really am.
I'm ready to try.
Systems?
Blame none but itself for its most dreaded menace.
Microface.
What?
It's something my grandpa used to say.
Geez, I'm late for a report.
I'm supposed to be in the booth 20 minutes ago.
Wish that suit made you super fast.
Nah, that guy is still under copyright.
That cry isn't coming from a tea party.
Amina, tell them I'll be late.
Sam, no.
Where danger stalks the city,
Microface will be there.
Did your abuelo used to say that?
I made that one up myself.
Oh, brother.
OK, I'll tell them you're out sick.
Go take those punks down.
Time for Microface.
Micro.
Micro.
Micro.
Microface.
Time.
