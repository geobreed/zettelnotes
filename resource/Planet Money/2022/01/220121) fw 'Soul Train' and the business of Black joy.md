When Soul Train first launched in 1970, Black audiences weren't understood as a viable target market. Don Cornelius changed that forever with his weekly TV dance show. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

In 1970, when Don Cornelius first launched Soul Train, it was still relatively rare to see Black people on network TV. So the idea of a Black-owned show featuring Black performers and created for a Black audience was revolutionary.

Don Cornelius's weekly TV dance show became a huge and enduring hit. And Don Cornelius himself pioneered the business of Black joy, and opened doors for Black people from Hollywood to Wall Street to Madison Avenue.

Music: "Soul Train" and "Soul Train Line."

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

JAMES SNEED, BYLINE: OK, y'all ready?

SONARI GLINTON, HOST:

Yes, I am ready.

Not long ago, our valiant producer James took us down a pretty joyful rabbit hole.

ERIKA BERAS, HOST:

Hold on. Remind me what we're doing.

SNEED: We're watching old-school "Soul Train" videos.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BERAS: I can't dance 'cause then I'll bump the mic.

GLINTON: Was that a kalimba already?

BERAS: This opening is imprinted in my mind, along with "Reading Rainbow."

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

DON CORNELIUS: The Soul...

GLINTON: The graphic is so iconic, like, of the train going through - that's Chicago. I didn't realize that.

BERAS: That is Chicago, isn't it?

"Soul Train."

GLINTON: "Soul Train" - Erika, even if you've never watched this show, even if you've never heard of its conductor, Don Cornelius, the cultural cornerstone that is "Soul Train" has inevitably touched your life. That funky '70s neon train bumping and jumping on the tracks signaled the weekly start of a revolutionary television dance show.

BERAS: Sonari, we spent over two hours...

GLINTON: (Laughter).

BERAS: ...Watching some of the greatest moments from "Soul Train."

GLINTON: Yeah, like that one time when Mary Wilson from the Supremes convinced Don Cornelius to go down his own "Soul Train" line.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

CORNELIUS: You think I could come up that "Soul Train" line?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yeah.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Sure.

(CHEERING)

GLINTON: Look how big his Afro is, and that tie with giant polka dots.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

CORNELIUS: All right. Here we go with the J.B.'s - Fred Wesley and the J.B.'s and "Doing It To Death."

(SOUNDBITE OF FRED WESLEY AND THE J.B.'S SONG, "DOING IT TO DEATH")

FRED WESLEY: Uh. How you feeling, brother?

GLINTON: All right.

(SOUNDBITE OF FRED WESLEY AND THE J.B.'S SONG, "DOING IT TO DEATH")

WESLEY: You feelin' good?

GLINTON: We used to roller skate to this.

BERAS: I think if I tried doing that now, I'd probably break a hip.

GLINTON: Oh, my God.

BERAS: Oh, there she is.

GLINTON: Look at them.

BERAS: Oh, that's a beautiful dress.

GLINTON: Oh, my goodness.

BERAS: He's got, like, a little glide thing. He's got a two-step glide - glide, glide.

GLINTON: When they say Black excellence, that's it right there.

BERAS: We also watched when Stevie Wonder made up a song about "Soul Train" on the spot.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

STEVIE WONDER: (Playing piano, singing) "Soul Train."

BERAS: Oh, my goodness.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

WONDER: (Playing piano, singing) When Don Cornelius...

CORNELIUS: (Laughter).

WONDER: (Playing piano, singing) And let me hear everybody say...

GLINTON: That is just so stunning.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

WONDER: (Playing piano, singing) Where all the brothers and sisters get together - say it louder.

UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Clapping, singing) Where all the brothers and sisters get together.

GLINTON: Ooh, like, this is televised Black joy.

BERAS: James, thank you for bringing joy into our lives.

GLINTON: 1971 - that was the year that "Soul Train" first hit our national consciousness, making the show 50 years old - 50 years. And over that time, beyond just the magical made-for-TV moments, the show has given us oh, so much.

(SOUNDBITE OF FRANCOIS-MAXIME BOUTAULT AND FREDERIC VITANI'S "SOUL TRAIN LINE")

BERAS: The robot - that was "Soul Train." The moonwalk - that was "Soul Train." Poppin' and lockin' - also "Soul Train."

GLINTON: From where we stand now, we know that Black culture is, was and will always be influential. That is pretty obvious. But until "Soul Train," Hollywood, Wall Street and Madison Avenue weren't so sure that Black culture could make money.

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sonari Glinton.

BERAS: In Erika Beras. Today on the show, the business of Black joy - how Don Cornelius became "Soul Train's" conductor and opened the door for generations of Black creators in Hollywood.

(SOUNDBITE OF FRANCOIS-MAXIME BOUTAULT AND FREDERIC VITANI'S "SOUL TRAIN LINE")

GLINTON: Erika, I feel like you and I cannot talk about "Soul Train" unless we talk about where it started - in my hometown - Chi-Town - Chicago - in the year 1969. Now, remember, this was one year after the assassination of Martin Luther King, when riots devastated many American cities and Chicago was becoming the poster child for urban decay and segregation.

BERAS: And out of this tumultuous moment strides a confident, stylish young Black man with a love of all things Black.

GLINTON: That confident, stylish young Black man was Don Cornelius.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CORNELIUS: We're going to take our first call. Yes. Do you have an opinion as to who our most effective and relevant Black leader is?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yes - Jesse Jackson.

CORNELIUS: Why do you feel...

BERAS: Don was a TV newsman covering the civil rights movement. And that activist energy rubbed off.

GLINTON: But Don's contribution to the movement wasn't necessarily a march or a boycott. It was dance.

NELSON GEORGE: Don Cornelius would do a party. He'd have a local group - maybe The Impressions, if he was lucky, or someone like that - come on.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "MIGHTY MIGHTY (SPADE & WHITEY)")

THE IMPRESSIONS: (Singing) ...About who's taking who. And mighty, mighty - spade and whitey.

GEORGE: And that was the beginnings of the "Soul Train" idea.

BERAS: That's Nelson George. He wrote the book on "Soul Train." It's called "The Hippest Trip In America." Don Cornelius was a newsman, but he was also a DJ. And a lot of DJs were hosting parties to make extra money.

GLINTON: Don decided, let's put some of those parties on TV. Maybe I can get a little corner of the local market. He had a model to follow. There were already long-running TV dance shows, like "American Bandstand," "Hullabaloo" and "Shindig!"

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "BANDSTAND BOOGIE")

BARRY MANILOW: (Singing) The Philadelphia way. We're going to drop in on all the music they play on the Bandstand. Bandstand.

GEORGE: But they were never focused on Black youth. They were always kind of white kids, maybe a token or two Black couple dancing. And they'd had Black talent, but they would not necessarily have Black audiences. And Don's idea was to - how do I do this with a Black audience with Black music?

BERAS: Black people on television being themselves - it doesn't seem radical or revolutionary now, but in 1960s America, it was.

GLINTON: On television, Black people were a novelty. You know, if you saw a Black person on TV, you'd call up your friends and be like, turn on Channel 7.

BERAS: So Don has the vision; make a televised dance show for and about Black teens. But he knows he can't just go to the TV station where he works and ask for a time slot. He has to sell them on it. He needs to show them that his idea can bring in money.

GLINTON: By getting a sponsor. Almost immediately, he finds one, one of the world's biggest advertisers - Sears and Roebuck. It was headquartered in Chicago, and it was the go-to local sponsor. Don was lucky he had a buddy, a white guy, in the marketing department at Sears. And it just so happens that around this time, Sears was beginning to focus on urban stores and the Black consumer. So Don's friend says, sure, Sears will advertise on your show.

GEORGE: And that, too - to be a very fateful decision on the part of those local Sears guys. That was the beginning of "Soul Train" and the business of "Soul Train."

GLINTON: Now, just to note, this idea that Sears had to think of the Black consumer as an integral part of the economy - well, that was not just Sears' idea. There were a whole group of Black entrepreneurs who emerged from the civil rights movement who believed what feels kind of like a basic truth to me - that Black joy wins.

BERAS: And Black joy was winning. Motown was dominating record charts. A book called "The 30 Billion Dollar Negro," written by a Black journalist, hit bestseller lists in 1969, saying basically, Black consumers should not be ignored.

GEORGE: In the late '60s, Black folks, especially Black people who wanted to be in marketing and in business, were just trying to show the white business world that the Black consumer market was very vital and very lucrative. There's no essence. There's no Black enterprise. The Black advertising agencies are still very, very new. So there's not a lot of discussion in the white business world of the Black consumer as a target market.

BERAS: So now Sears is the local sponsor of "Soul Train," and that makes it an easy sell to the TV station. Now, Sonari, there are some moments in business that are only huge in retrospect.

GLINTON: Exactly. IBM could've owned Microsoft.

BERAS: And Blockbuster Video could have owned Netflix.

GLINTON: Google could have been bought by Excite.

BERAS: Who?

GLINTON: Exactly. And Sears...

BERAS: (Laughter).

GLINTON: ...Or the local TV station that first broadcast "Soul Train" could've owned the show. But they didn't think to do it. Don Cornelius would say later that they didn't imagine how big his idea could be.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CORNELIUS: I don't think anybody knew what it was. But they could've said to me - when they said OK to the "Soul Train" idea, they could've said, OK, you go ahead and try that "Soul Train" stuff, but you sign this right here, and we own it, and I wouldn't even have blinked. I would've just signed it. But they never said that to me.

GLINTON: They never said that to him. And Don Cornelius became 100% owner of "Soul Train."

BERAS: The sole owner of "Soul Train."

GLINTON: Got to love that. In 1970, the show launched out of a small TV studio filmed in Chicago's Board of Trade Building. It looked like a low-budget local show. It didn't even have color cameras. It was broadcast in black and white. But it was an immediate sensation - the local music acts, the teens who showed up to dance on the show after school. From the very first airing, Black and white Chicagoans tuned in.

BERAS: Almost immediately, those cool Chicago teens and their style - their big Afros - that made "Soul Train" so attractive to peers would get the notice of an entire industry that was growing.

GLINTON: Hair care.

BERAS: Hair was literally growing. And caring for naturals and Afros was becoming a moneymaker. And that money would fuel "Soul Train," help it go from local air to TV screens all over the country.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Makeda - serene, majestic, beautiful Queen of Sheba.

GLINTON: Johnson Products, started by George Johnson and his wife, Joan, would corner the Black hair care market in the '60s with their Afro Sheen. And when the Afro became the hair style, Afro Sheen became the product.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: She is Black essence, and her beautiful natural hair is her crowning glory. Afro Sheen concentrated shampoo pampers and conditions as it cleans.

BERAS: More hair, more product, more money.

GLINTON: More money to spend on advertising and marketing. George Johnson was impressed by "Soul Train," and he offered to sponsor the show to the tune of $600,000, which is about $4 million in today's money.

BERAS: But only if "Soul Train" did something no Black-owned show had done yet - go national.

GLINTON: Don's show hadn't even been on the air for a year, and now he's taking it to Los Angeles. Nelson George again.

GEORGE: LA is clearly the new mecca. And, you know, Motown's about to move to LA. And so it was a natural place to be because the biggest challenge of being in Chicago was booking talent.

GLINTON: Don knew the show needed more polish, more professionalism and also some color cameras.

BERAS: Also, bigger stars - and Hollywood had them.

GLINTON: Coming up, Don finds bringing Chicago cool to sunny Los Angeles - that ain't so easy.

(SOUNDBITE OF IAN THOMAS AND RON PRICE'S "SOUL TRAIN")

BERAS: In 1971, when Don Cornelius moved "Soul Train" to Los Angeles, he needed to capture the magic that made the Chicago show work, starting with the dancers. In Chicago, Don knew where to find them. But in LA, he needed help. That's where Pam Brown came in

GLINTON: In Los Angeles, Pam knew every teenager who could do the bump or hustle. She was a teen coordinator for the city, and it was her job to find activities to keep young people busy when they weren't in school.

BERAS: Pam and Don met at a rec center.

PAM BROWN: He had this very deep, baritone voice. He was a slow walker and a slow talker, always stylish in his clothes. He always had a pinky ring on. And that was my vision of being real cool.

GLINTON: I need to get myself a pinky ring.

BERAS: (Laughter) Don got Pam to organize dance auditions for his show. Got to love the hustle. But Pam says he found out the LA teens were different.

P BROWN: When Don would come to auditions at the different parks, he says, you know, these kids don't really know how to dance. This is not really what I'm looking for. You know, there's a lot of acrobatics in it. A lot of props were being used. And I said, well, these are the LA kids.

BERAS: In Chicago, the dance style was more subtle, laid-back. You don't get too sweaty. In LA, they went hard - way bigger, more theatrical.

GLINTON: But Don doesn't have much choice because remember who he is right now. He's got that Afro Sheen money, but only if he can get "Soul Train" off the ground in LA. And no one's exactly rolling out the welcome wagon.

BERAS: Don pitches his show to the networks - ABC, CBS, NBC - and they all say no.

P BROWN: He was turned down by so many people. No one was interested in a Black dance show. And another challenge was many of the stations that did accept him were airing the show 2 o'clock in the morning, midnight. Here in Los Angeles, it was like 11 o'clock on a Saturday.

BERAS: When the networks turned down the show, that meant Don had to sell "Soul Train" market by market, station by station. But it also meant Don still owned the show fully. If "Soul Train" took off, Don would get all the profit. But until then, he had all the risk.

GLINTON: And he doesn't have anywhere to shoot, so he finds a TV studio that he can rent on weekends. He scrounges up a crew. And he doesn't have a caterer the way, you know, you'd get in a Hollywood TV set. Instead, he feeds everyone with a pallet of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

BERAS: Oh, my God. The first episode of "Soul Train" aired in 1971.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

CORNELIUS: Gifted and talented Gladys Knight and the dancing, swinging, singing Pips.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "FRIENDSHIP TRAIN")

GLADYS KNIGHT & THE PIPS: (Singing) Well, well, well, well, well. Calling out to everyone across the nation.

BERAS: But when it first aired, the show was only in seven markets. Don and Afro Sheen had a goal of 24. That wasn't Don's only problem.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CORNELIUS: We had one big star for the opening show, which was Gladys Knight & the Pips. After that show, we were really skinning our knees up trying to get serious, major people.

BERAS: It's a music dance show that's having trouble getting music acts.

GLINTON: A true dilemma.

BERAS: In that first national season, even though he's come to LA for the talent, he's booking acts from...

GLINTON: Chicago.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

CORNELIUS: His name is Curtis Mayfield.

(SOUNDBITE OF CURTIS MAYFIELD SONG, "PUSHERMAN")

BERAS: In the meantime, he's knocking on hotel room doors all over the city, trying to bring whatever big names he can onto the show.

BRUCE TALAMON: There were a lot of acts coming through Los Angeles - you know, The Isley Brothers, The O'Jays, you know, Marvin Gaye.

GLINTON: That's Bruce Talamon. He was a photographer for the early years of "Soul Train," and he saw Don's hustle behind the scenes.

TALAMON: Don would make sure that they were taping if a big act was coming in. And so that meant that he didn't have to pay for their hotels or he didn't have to pay for their air flight to come out because he was double dipping.

BERAS: And while all that was going on, one thing did work - like, really well. Those dancers Don had been dubious of - they were a hit.

GLINTON: Author Nelson George says the dancers were the first stars of the show. Thanks to them, syndication began to pick up, and the show moved to a better time slot on Saturday mornings.

GEORGE: You know, it used to be, if there was a hot dance in the East Coast, your cousins from New York and Philadelphia would come in the summer, and they would show the dance. Dances traveled almost like word-of-mouth, right? Suddenly, you watch someone do a particular move on a Saturday morning, 11 o'clock - 12:30, 1 o'clock on the playground, that same dance is being done. American dance and Black vernacular dance was transformed by "Soul Train."

BERAS: By Season 2, that little booking problem Don had in Season 1 - it's not really a thing anymore.

GLINTON: Now there's a whole cavalcade of stars coming onto the show, including Aretha Franklin, the Jackson 5 and Al Green.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

AL GREEN: (Singing) Love.

BERAS: Oh, my.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Big mamas all over America right now are just, like, having to take a pause on the couch.

BERAS: (Laughter).

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Remembering Al Green in 1972 - Lord. Phew.

GLINTON: And then, Episode 19, smack in the middle of the second season, "Soul Train" booked the artist that would cement the show's status, putting it at the nexus of Black music, fashion and business. I'm talking soul brother No. 1.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SOUL TRAIN")

CORNELIUS: What would you like to start out with?

JAMES BROWN: Well, I'd like to start out with that kind of thing right now. The only way we can get a lot of things done is get on a good foot.

CORNELIUS: (Laughter) I could dig it. One time for James Brown.

(APPLAUSE)

GEORGE: The No. 1 booking that Don always talked about that was crucial was getting James Brown.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GET ON THE GOOD FOOT")

J BROWN: Can't pass the people, can't pass the - hit me.

GEORGE: Once Brown agreed to do the show, it opened a lot of doors.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GET ON THE GOOD FOOT")

J BROWN: (Singing) Get on - I want to get on the good foot. I want to do it for the good foot.

GLINTON: This moment when James Brown first comes to "Soul Train" is legendary not just because James Brown is appearing on a TV show hosted by a Black man. Remember, that is very huge.

BERAS: Yeah, but the even bigger deal is what James Brown notices the day of the taping.

GEORGE: James Brown comes to the sets of "Soul Train." He's looking around at the lights, at the camera people, and he meets Don. He says, well, who's your partner?

GLINTON: Bruce Talamon, the "Soul Train" photographer, was there when it happened.

TALAMON: You know, as I'm photographing Don and James Brown, I hear James asking, so who you with? Who you with, brother? You know, who are you with? And he was asking, you know, who of the non-colored persuasion was backing you financially. And Don Cornelius turned and looked at him and said, James, it's just me, brother. I'm backing this.

GLINTON: I have heard this story dozens of times, and I love it every time. Like, just think about it. This is James Brown at his most James Brown. He is the biggest Black artist of the day - probably ever. This superstar can't conceive of a show that is not just for Black people, but owned by a Black man.

BERAS: And he's looking at Don Cornelius, and he's looking at all the Black photographers and the cameramen and the showrunners, and he is impressed. It's like game recognizing game. And the thing about Don's success is it's connected to the success of a whole bunch of other Black businesspeople, starting with his sponsor, hair care magnate George Johnson of Afro Sheen.

GEORGE: "Soul Train's" success is also tied into a movement of Black entrepreneurship in media because, suddenly, as "Soul Train" succeeds in the early '70s, you know, George Johnson's hair ads are blowing up. And that gives a way to argue that you should be advertising through a Black agency for a Black TV show for a Black audience, all of it unprecedented.

BERAS: In 1971, George Johnson's company, Johnson Products, became the first Black-owned company listed on the stock market.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAMITA JO FREEMAN: I want a superfro.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Get the blowout kit.

FREEMAN: How about an Afro puff?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Get the blowout kit.

FREEMAN: And for a soulful cornrow?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Afro Sheen's blowout kit makes your hair softer, more lustrous and easier to manage. Makes any style...

GLINTON: You know, if I had hair, I'd get a blowout (laughter). So the young woman in that ad, Damita Jo Freeman, she first got noticed on "Soul Train." And ads like this helped turn Black teens into a target market for advertisers. It is the creation of a whole Black entertainment advertising business ecosystem.

BERAS: And it lays the foundation of what would become Black Hollywood because Don wasn't just opening the door for Black talent. He was keeping it open.

TALAMON: He would give somebody Black a chance to do the work.

GLINTON: "Soul Train" photographer Bruce Talamon again.

TALAMON: Don was a race man, and Don liked to work with Black people. In Hollywood, generally when I would go on these sets, you know, the - quite frankly, the only things that were Black would be me and my cameras. You know, you'd go on, and the crew would be all white, and the cast would be all white. And when I say Don was a race man, you would look around, and you would see the teen coordinator - she was Black. Producers - they were Black. The announcer was Black. I'm just saying, you know, he did it with Black folks.

BERAS: Bruce says, yes, Don gave Black people an opportunity to work on "Soul Train" - which a paycheck is nice. But bigger than that was the credit on their resume they might not have gotten anywhere else.

GLINTON: But we have to mention not everyone was getting paychecks. No matter how successful Don got, he always ran a tight ship.

TALAMON: This was not party time. This was a business. And he was fronting this business, so he was counting every penny, which I will say that I think the dancers could've been treated better. OK? What do I mean by that? The dancers were never paid. The dancers got a box of chicken and a soft drink, and that was it.

GLINTON: "Soul Train's" audience continued to grow through the '70s, '80s and held strong until the '90s. It even went international. All through the rise of disco and hip-hop and even MTV, Don Cornelius says "Soul Train" kept getting superstars - Prince, Run-D.M.C. and a young and skinny Snoop Dogg.

BERAS: It made stars out of some of those unpaid dancers. Fred Berry, known as Rerun, starred in the TV show "What's Happening!!" Damita Jo Freeman, who was in that Afro Sheen commercial, she became a big-deal choreographer. And Rosie Perez, she got her start as a dancer on "Soul Train."

GLINTON: The last dancers hustled down the "Soul Train" line in 2006. When the show ended, "Soul Train" was the longest-running TV show in syndication history.

BERAS: Nelson George says the genius of Don Cornelius isn't just that he introduced a generation of creators to Hollywood. It's that he introduced Hollywood to the very idea of Black folk as creators.

GEORGE: Black joy is a business. And we - you know, we had been through a era of struggle, of marching. And the simplest ideas are often the most revolutionary. Putting Black people on screen, having a good time - you know, it seems like such an obvious thing. Every music video is basically that concept. It never had happened before, and Don had the dream to do that, to put these folks on and just let them be themselves.

GLINTON: When Don Cornelius died in 2012, "Soul Train" lines broke out around the globe. People strutted, sashayed and roller-skated down the line with their kids, their big hats, loud patterns and, of course, giant Afros.

BERAS: Mourning the man and celebrating all that he created.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Woo. Go, girl.

GLINTON: I'm on Twitter - @Sonari. Well, this is not his first credit, but this "Soul Train" was conducted by the Revered James Sneed. He's an associate producer. But I say he should dust off his television ideas. You know what I'm saying?

BERAS: This episode had production help from Corey Bridges, fact-checking by Rhys Atkinson-Whipps. It was engineered by Isaac Rodrigues and edited by Molly Messick. Alex Goldmark is PLANET MONEY's executive producer.

GLINTON: Special thanks to former Right On! magazine writer Flo Jenkins, Chicago DJ Richard Steele and Ayana Contreras, whose book "Energy Never Dies" helped inspired this very episode.

BERAS: Please check out the episode Sam Sanders and our friends at It's Been A Minute did on "Soul Train," where they take a look at the cultural impact of the show. I'm Erika Beras.

GLINTON: And I'm Sonari Glinton. And in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

Devastated many American cities and Chicago was becoming the poster child for urban decay and segregation and out of this
tumultuous moment strides a confident stylish young black man with a love of all things black that
Confident stylish young black man was Don Cornelius. We're gonna take our first call
Yes, do you have an opinion as to who our most effective and relevant black leader is
Don was a TV newsman
Covering the civil rights movement and that activist energy rubbed off
But Don's contribution to the movement wasn't necessarily a march or a boycott. It was dance
Don Cornelius would do a party. He'd have a local group
Maybe the impressions if he was lucky or someone like that. Come on
Oh
And that was the beginnings of the Soul Train idea that's Nelson George he wrote the book on Soul Train
It's called the hippest trip in America Don Cornelius was a newsman
But he was also a DJ and a lot of DJs were hosting parties to make extra money Don decided
Let's put some of those parties on TV. Maybe I can get a little corner of the local market
He had a model to follow there were already long-running TV dance shows like American Bandstand
Hollabaloo and Shindig
But they would never
Focused on black youth. They were always kind of white kids
Maybe a token or two black couple dancing and it had black talent
But they would not necessarily have black audiences and Don's idea was to
How do I do this with a black audience with black music black people on television being themselves?
It doesn't seem radical or revolutionary now
But in 1960s America it was on television black people were a novelty
You know if you saw a black person on TV
You call up your friends and be like turn on Channel 7 so Don has the vision make a televised dance show
For and about black teens, but he knows he can't just go to the TV station where he works and asked for a time
Slot he has to sell them on it
He needs to show them that his idea can bring in money by getting a sponsor
Almost immediately he finds one one of the world's biggest advertisers Sears and Roebuck
It was headquartered in Chicago and it was the go-to local sponsor Don was lucky
He had a buddy a white guy in the marketing department at Sears and it just so happens that around this time
Sears was beginning to focus on urban stores and the black consumer. So Don's friend says sure
Sears will advertise on your show and that too to be a very
Fateful decision on the part of those local Sears guys
That was the beginning of the soul train and in the business of soul train now
Just a note this idea that Sears had to think of the black consumer as an integral part of the economy
Well, that was not just Sears's idea
There were a whole group of black entrepreneurs who emerged from the civil rights movement who believed
What feels kind of like a basic truth to me the black joy?
Wins and black joy was winning Motown was dominating record charts a book called the
$30-billion Negro written by a black journalist hit bestseller lists in
1969 saying basically black consumers should not be ignored in the late 60s
black folks officially black people who wanted to be in marketing and in business were just trying to
show
The white business world that the black consumer market was was very vital
And very lucrative. There's no essence. There's no black enterprise
The black advertising agencies are still very very new
So there's not a lot of discussion in the white business world of the black consumer as a target market
So now Sears is the local sponsor of soul train and that makes it an easy sell to the TV station now
Sonari there are some moments in business that are only huge in retrospect exactly
IBM could have owned Microsoft and blockbuster video could have owned Netflix
Google could have been bought by excite who exactly and Sears or the local TV station that first
Broadcast soul train could have owned the show but they didn't think to do it
Don Cornelius would say later that they didn't imagine how big his idea could be
I don't think anybody knew what it was, but they could have said to me when when they said okay to the soldier
And I did they could said
Okay, you go ahead and try that soul train stuff
But you sign this right here and we own it and I wasn't I wouldn't even have blinked
I would have just signed it but they never said that to me
They never said that to him and Don Cornelius became 100% owner of soul train the sole owner of soul train
Gotta love that in
1970 the show launched out of a small TV studio filmed in Chicago's Board of Trade building
It looked like a low-budget local show. It didn't even have color cameras
It was broadcast in black and white
But it was an immediate sensation the local music acts the teens who showed up to dance on the show after school
From the very first airing black and white Chicagoans tuned in almost immediately
Those cool Chicago teens in their style
They're big afros that made soul train so attractive to Sears would get the notice of an entire industry
That was growing haircare hair was literally growing and caring for naturals and afros was becoming a moneymaker
And that money would fuel soul train help it go from local air to TV screens all over the country
Makita serene
Majestic beautiful queen of Shiva Johnson products started by George Johnson and his wife Joan
Would cornered the black haircare market in the 60s with their afro sheen and when the afro became the hair style
Afro sheen became the product. She is black essence and a beautiful natural hair is her crowning glory
Afro sheen concentrated shampoo Pampers and conditions as it cleans more hair more product
More money more money to spend on advertising and marketing
George Johnson was impressed by soul train and he offered to sponsor the show to the tune of
$600,000 which is about four million dollars in today's money
But only if soul train did something no black owned show had done yet
Go national Don show hadn't even been on the air for a year and now he's taking it to Los Angeles
Nelson George again LA is clearly
the new Mecca and you know Motown's about to move to LA and
So it was an actual place to be because the biggest challenge of being in Chicago was booking talent Don knew the show
Needed more polish more professionalism and also some color cameras also bigger stars and
Hollywood had them coming up Don finds bringing Chicago cool to sunny Los Angeles
That ain't so easy in
In
1971 when Don Cornelius moved soul train to Los Angeles
He needed to capture the magic that made the Chicago show work starting with the dancers in
Chicago Don knew where to find them but in LA he needed help
That's where Pam Brown came in in Los Angeles Pam knew every teenager who could do the bump or hustle
She was the team coordinator for the city and it was her job to find activities to keep young people busy
When they weren't in school Pam and Don met at a rec center. He had this very deep baritone voice
He was a slow walker and a slow talker
always stylish in his clothes
He always had a pinky ring on
And
That was my vision of being real cool. I need to get myself a pinky ring
Don got Pam to organize dance auditions for his show got to love the hustle
But Pam says he found out the LA teens were different when Don would come to
Auditions at the different parks. He says, you know, these kids don't really know how to dance
This is not really what I'm looking for
You know, there's a lot of acrobatics in it a lot of props
Were being used and I said, well, these are these are the LA kids in Chicago
The dance style was more subtle laid back. You don't get too sweaty in LA
They went hard way bigger more theatrical but Don doesn't have much choice because remember who he is right now
He's got that afro sheen money
But only if he can get soul training off the ground in LA and no one's exactly rolling out the welcome wagon
Don pitches his show to the networks ABC CBS NBC and they all say no
He was turned down
by so many people no one was interested in a black dance show and
Another challenge was many of the stations that did accept him were airing the show
Two o'clock in the morning midnight
Here in Los Angeles. It was like 11 o'clock on a Saturday
When the networks turned down the show that meant Don had to sell soul train market by market
Station by station, but it also meant Don still owned the show fully if soul train took off
Don would get all the profits but until then he had all the risk and he doesn't have anywhere to shoot
So he finds a TV studio that he can rent on weekends
He scrounges up a crew and he doesn't have a caterer the way, you know
You'd get in a Hollywood TV set instead. He feeds everyone with a palette of Kentucky Fried Chicken
Oh my god, the first episode of soul train aired in
1971
But when it first aired the show was only in seven markets Don and Afrosheen had a goal of
24 that wasn't Don's only problem. We got one big star for the opening show
Which was Gladys Knight in the pips after that show we were really
Skinning our knees up trying to get serious major people
It's a music dance show that's having trouble getting music acts a true dilemma in that first national season
Even though he's come to LA for the talent. He's booking acts from Chicago. His name is Curtis Mayfield
In the meantime, he's knocking on hotel room doors all over the city trying to bring whatever big names
He can onto the show. There were a lot of acts
Coming through Los Angeles, you know, the Isley brothers the OJs
You know Marvin Gaye, that's Bruce Solomon
He was a photographer for the early years of soul train and he saw Don's hustle behind the scenes
Don would make sure that they were taping if a big act was coming in and
So that meant that he didn't have to pay for their
Hotels or he didn't have to pay for their air flight to come out because he was he was double-dipping
And while all that was going on one thing did work like really well
Those dancers Don had been dubious of they were a hit Arthur
Nelson George says the dancers were the first stars of the show
Thanks to them syndication began to pick up and the show moved to a better time slot on Saturday mornings
You know used to be if it was a hot dance in the East Coast
Your cousins from New York and Philadelphia would come in the summer and they would show the dance has traveled
Almost like word-of-mouth, right?
Suddenly you watch someone do a particular move on a Saturday morning 11 o'clock
1230 1 o'clock on the playground that same dance is being done
American dance and and black vernacular dance
Was transformed by Soul Train by season 2 that little booking problem Don had in season 1
It's not really a thing anymore now
there's a whole cavalcade of stars coming onto the show including Aretha Franklin the Jackson 5 and
Al Green
And
then
episode 19
Smack in the middle of the second season
Soul Train booked the artist that would submit the show's status putting it at the nexus of black music
Fashion and business. I'm talking soul brother number one. What would you like to start out with?
Well, I'd like to start out with our current thing right now
The only way we can get a lot of things done is get on a good foot. I
Could dig it one time for James Brown
The number one booking that Don always talked about that was crucial was getting James Brown
Once Brown agreed to do the show it opened a lot of doors
This moment when James Brown first comes to Soul Train is legendary
Not just because James Brown is appearing on a TV show hosted by a black man. Remember that is very huge
Yeah
But the even bigger deal is what James Brown notices the day of the taping James Brown comes to the sets of Soul Train
He's looking around at the lights at the camera people and he meets Don and says well, who's your partner Bruce?
Taliban the Soul Train photographer was there when it happened, you know as I'm photographing Don and James Brown I
hear James
Asking so who you with who you with brother, you know, who who are you with and he was asking, you know
Who of the non-colored persuasion was was backing you financially and
Don Cornelius turned and looked at him and said James it's just me brother. I'm back in this
I have heard this story dozens of times and I love it every time like just think about it
This is James Brown at his most James Brown
He is the biggest black artist of the day probably ever this superstar can't conceive of a show
That is not just for black people but owned by a black man
And he's looking at Don Cornelius and he's looking at all the black photographers and the cameramen and the showrunners and he is
Impressed it's like game
Recognizing game and the thing about Don's success is it's connected to the success of a whole bunch of other black business people
Starting with his sponsor haircare magnate George Johnson of Afrosheen Soul Train success is also tied into a movement of
black entrepreneurship in media
because suddenly
As Soul Train succeeds in the early 70s
You know George Johnson's hair ads are blowing up
And that gives a way to argue that you should be
Advertising through a black agency for a black TV show for a black audience all of it unprecedented in
1971 George Johnson's company Johnson products became the first black-owned company listed on the stock market
Afrosheen's blowout kit makes your hair softer more lustrous and easier to manage makes any
You know if I had hair I'd get a blowout the young woman in that ad Demita Joe Friedman
She first got noticed on Soul Train and ads like this
Helped turn black teens into a target market for advertisers
It is the creation of a whole black entertainment advertising business ecosystem
And it lays the foundation of what would become black Hollywood because Don wasn't just opening the door for black talent
He was keeping it open
He would give somebody black a chance to do the work Soul Train photographer Bruce Toleman again Don was a race man and
And Don liked to work with black people in Hollywood
Generally when I would go on these sets, you know the quite frankly the only things that were black would be me and my cameras
You know you'd go on and the crew would be all white and the cast would be all white
And when I say Don was a race man, you would look around and you would see
The teen coordinator she was black producers. They were black. The announcer was black
I'm just saying, you know, he did it with black folks Bruce says yes
Don gave black people an opportunity to work on Soul Train, which a paycheck is nice
But bigger than that was the credit on the resume. They might not have gotten anywhere else
But we have to mention not everyone was getting paychecks. No matter how successful Don got he always ran a tight ship
This was not party time. This was a business and he was fronting this business. So he was counting every penny
Which I will say I think the dancers could have been treated better
Okay, what do I mean by that? The dancers the dancers were never paid the dancers got
a box of chicken and
And a soft drink and that was it Soul Train's audience continued to grow through the 70s 80s and held strong until the 90s
It even went international all through the rise of disco and hip-hop and even MTV
Don Cornelius's Soul Train kept getting superstars
Prince run DMC and a young and skinny Snoop Dogg it made stars out of some of those unpaid dancers
Fred Barry known as reruns starting the TV show what's happening to meet a Joe Freeman who was in that afro scene commercial
She became a big-deal choreographer and Rosie Perez
She got her start as a dancer on Soul Train the last dancers hustled down the Soul Train line in
2006 when the show ended Soul Train was the longest running TV show in syndication history
Nelson George says the genius of Don Cornelius isn't just that he introduced a generation of creators to Hollywood
It's that he introduced Hollywood to the very idea of black folk as creators
Black joy is a business and we you know, we had been through an era of struggle of
marching and
The simplest ideas are often the most revolutionary putting black people on it on screen having a good time
You know, it seems like such an obvious thing every music video is basically that concept
It never had happened before and Don had the dream to do that
To put these folks on and just let them be themselves when Don Cornelius died in
2012 Soul Train lines broke out around the globe
People strutted sashayed and roller skated down the line with their kids their big hats loud patterns and of course
giant afros mourning the man and
Celebrating all that he created
