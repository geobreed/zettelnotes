There's a movement underway in Georgia. More and more communities around Atlanta are choosing to keep their tax dollars very local, and become their own cities. It's a story about equity and exclusion – and also potholes. | Subscribe to Planet Money+ in Apple Podcasts or at plus.npr.org/planetmoney.

In the last 20 years, at least ten communities around Atlanta, Georgia decided to become their own cities. And more have attempted cityhood. They all want more say over local rules, and to keep more of their tax dollars for themselves.

One version of this movement's history starts with Oliver Porter, a retired telecom executive who led his own community of Sandy Springs to cityhood in 2005 and now advises others on how to do it. But the idea of splitting off and becoming a separate city – it actually dates back to the 1960s and has segregationist roots.

On today's show, a mostly Black and brown community tries to use cityhood for its own ends.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

ERIKA BERAS, HOST:

There's a corner of Cobb County, Ga., outside of Atlanta, where you see one kind of business over and over again.

LEROY HUTCHINS: This is a tire shop. This is another tire shop.

BERAS: Tire shops - so many of them.

HUTCHINS: More tire shops to your right - tire shop next to it.

BERAS: I'm driving around with Leroy Hutchins. Everyone calls him Tre'. He's lived here in Mableton, Ga., most of his life.

HUTCHINS: Three tire shops just past here on your left-hand side - right next to each other, really.

BERAS: Mableton is 15 miles outside of shiny, bustling Atlanta. But you wouldn't know it if you just got plopped down here because Mableton has a left-behind feeling to it - tall grass along the roadsides, aging strip malls, partly vacant, with some dollar stores and pawn shops and all those tire shops. We drove around for, like, an hour and really do see so many - more than 20.

So is this, like, a destination for tire shops?

HUTCHINS: It feels like that.

BERAS: But then drive a little bit further...

HUTCHINS: Go to the light, and we'll make a right. And let's just go down by Six Flags.

BERAS: ...And I spot the crest of a roller coaster - actually, a bunch of them - colorful arcs surrounded by a big fence with signs on it that read, Six Flags Over Georgia. It's a huge amusement park without much around it, no restaurants or anything - just parking lots and trees.

So, like, I'm looking out this window here, and I see nothing but, like, trees.

HUTCHINS: Yes.

BERAS: And they're beautiful trees.

HUTCHINS: Yes.

BERAS: I love trees. And I see just, like, land. So what is your vision for what that would look like?

HUTCHINS: Six Flags Entertainment District, where people come here, and they want to stay here for a week.

BERAS: So like Disney World.

HUTCHINS: Disney is the example that we use. In Orlando, when you drive closer to the entrances of Disney World, you know that you are in Disney World headquarters. You know that. When you drive off our exit to come to Six Flags, there's nothing to really show you that this is the pride jewel of the southern portion of the county. We can change that.

BERAS: It's obviously a lot to aspire to - the area around one small regional theme park turning into a mini Orlando. The way Tre' sees it, what's holding Mableton back is it's not its own city. It's unincorporated. It's part of the larger county that surrounds it, Cobb County. So a lot of things about how Mableton works are dictated by the county, like zoning - what kind of businesses can come here. They control code enforcement. So when old tires pile up outside those tire shops, the county is supposed to give out the fines, which Tre' says isn't happening enough. And so Tre' and some other people from Mableton decided, you know what? Forget the county. Let's be our own city. But how do you make your own city?

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDERS JOHAN GREGER LEWEN'S "MOODY POP GUITARS")

BERAS: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Erika Beras.

MARY CHILDS, HOST:

And I'm Mary Childs. Today on the show - cityhood. If you think your community deserves better, form your own city.

BERAS: It sounds radical. But here in this part of Georgia, lots of communities have been doing what Mableton wants to do - banding together and forming their own cities.

CHILDS: Some places want to keep their tax dollars for themselves. Others, like Mableton, are looking for a little more say in how they run things.

BERAS: It's a story about equity, exclusion and the power that cities can hold - and also potholes.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDERS JOHAN GREGER LEWEN'S "MOODY POP GUITARS")

CHILDS: Mableton, where Tre' Hutchins grew up, is a mostly Black and brown community. The Six Flags has been there for decades. In the '90s, Tre' got his first job there, working at a concession stand selling hot dogs, popcorn, sodas. He went away for college and came back years later to raise his kids. And when he did, he saw so much had changed.

HUTCHINS: And I just started seeing the age and the decline in the area. And it was like, we have to do something. And I didn't know what it was.

CHILDS: Things that made Mableton a nice place to live - like the skating rink, the movie theater, the bowling alley - they were all gone.

BERAS: He saw plenty of development in other parts of the county but not Mableton. And you know how every town has a person who has their hands in everything? Well, in Mableton, that's Tre'.

You're on the school board.

HUTCHINS: Yes.

BERAS: You build houses for humanity.

HUTCHINS: Right. Still work in ministry.

BERAS: Still work in ministry. Do you coach teams?

HUTCHINS: Nope. That's not my forte. I do work with a production company here in Atlanta that puts on musicals sometimes.

BERAS: You sing?

HUTCHINS: Yeah, I do sing.

BERAS: OK.

HUTCHINS: I do sing and dance.

CHILDS: So naturally, Tre' starts thinking about Mableton's development problem - businesses closing and new development not coming their way.

BERAS: He tries to figure out why that's happening, and what he finds out is the zoning rules where he lives covered the entire county. That's how it works when you're an unincorporated community. The county makes the rules.

CHILDS: And the rules in Cobb County are designed for new development. So they require, like, a certain number of parking spaces, depending on what kind of new business is coming in. But those rules get in the way of redeveloping places that were built up a long time ago, like Mableton. A lot of the shopping centers there are smaller than what gets built now. So there just isn't room for all the parking that the county requires.

HUTCHINS: So auto repair shops where you don't necessarily need a lot of parking end up becoming the business of choice because of the zoning.

BERAS: This is how Tre' eventually came around to the idea that Mableton should be its own city.

HUTCHINS: The county is a large place, right? This is just a small portion of the county. And so you can't change county code to reflect something that's just going to be specific to the small area within the county. And so having a city would allow us to customize zoning so that we can specifically address some of the concerns that we're talking about right here through a municipality or a city ordinance versus through the county ordinance.

CHILDS: If Mableton were a city, it would have authority over some of its tax dollars. It could make its own ordinances, enforce its own codes, require less parking for new businesses coming in.

BERAS: In the U.S., cities are one of the oldest units of government. They formed organically, like near a waterway. The city of Philadelphia is older than the state of Pennsylvania.

CHILDS: There was a time when cities and municipalities were constantly cropping up. The 1950s, when the suburbs were growing, many of those became their own cities. A new city formed every three days.

BERAS: Today, the way cities are established tends to be more strategic. Developers size up trends and decide where to build. That's happening all over the south and west. In Tre's case, Mableton has been around for more than 100 years, and he wants to build it back up. For him, cityhood is a means to an end.

Was there, like, a moment when they're like, we need someone to do this, and nobody's hand went up? And you were like, is my hand slowly creeping up? Is my hand slowly creeping up?

HUTCHINS: So I met with, like, friends - people I grew up with, people I went to high school with that are still here. And we were eating some wings and talking about it. And then finally we were just, like, well, do you guys think this is something we should be doing? And they were, like, well, Tre', why don't you do it?

BERAS: Mableton becoming its own city was not some farfetched idea. Georgia's rules for becoming a city are pretty permissive. If the majority of people who live inside the proposed city boundaries support it - vote yes, we want to be a city - then it can happen. There is one hurdle - the state legislature has to sign off on the proposed new city before it can go to ballot. But after that, if it gets approved, a city can be a city if it takes on just three services, like planning and zoning or code enforcement.

CHILDS: Once Tre' had decided that he wanted to make Mableton a city, there was one person he knew he had to talk to - Oliver Porter.

BERAS: Oliver lives in Sandy Springs. It's also in the Atlanta suburbs, about a half hour drive away. It's kind of the model for what Tre's trying to do. Oliver got Sandy Springs turned into a city almost 20 years ago. Then he self-published a book about how he did it, which Tre' got his hands on. And then he called up Oliver.

HUTCHINS: He was, like, some of the pitfalls, some of the things not to do, you know...

BERAS: What were those things? Like what were the things he was like - what are the pitfalls?

HUTCHINS: Community engagement - he said, make sure that it is focused on community engagement - transparency, making sure that everything is out in the open, making sure that even your fundraising is very inclusive and not a developer paying for the study or something like that, making sure that this is community-driven and community-focused.

CHILDS: So Tre' started talking about Mableton cityhood with anyone he could. He met with business owners and renters and homeowners associations, started raising money for a feasibility study to prove out their plan.

HUTCHINS: We were literally sitting out in cul-de-sacs in communities in the summertime talking to...

BERAS: Ooh, hot.

HUTCHINS: ...HOA communities about - hey, this is - these are - this is what's on the table.

BERAS: At this point, Mableton's gotten pretty far in their planning. This fall, the people who have become citizens of the newly incorporated city will be able to vote on the idea. If the majority says yes, it'll go through.

CHILDS: If it happens, Tre's overlooked community - it's about 70,000 people - will have more power over itself, and Tre' believes they'll be able to put Mableton on a better path - fewer tire shops, more restaurants and stores and fun. They'll have a shot at their share of prosperity.

BERAS: But the cityhood movement around Atlanta - it started from a very different place. That's after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BERAS: Oliver Porter lives at the end of a cul-de-sac that overlooks the Chattahoochee River. He's 85, and to get an idea of the kind of person he is, when Oliver retired, he took up painting. On one wall of his house, there's a whole series of self-portraits.

OLIVER PORTER: You know, all of them are in different outfits. That's Lord Porter.

BERAS: Dressed up in a top hat.

PORTER: Tex Porter.

BERAS: Big cowboy hat.

PORTER: That's a Frenchman Porter.

BERAS: A beret, of course.

CHILDS: When Oliver decides he wants to do something, he does it himself. For example, he wanted an oak walnut-stained library, one with handmade paneled walls, shelves of cloth bound books and one of those fancy rolling ladders. So he made one in his basement.

BERAS: So you built and designed all of this yourself?

PORTER: I had no idea what I was doing when I was building this. I'd never done any woodworking or anything of this magnitude. And I guess I felt like, I want it, so I'll just do it.

CHILDS: This is the same attitude that led him to make his community of Sandy Springs into its own city.

BERAS: Sandy Springs is not like Mableton. It's the kind of place people describe as comfortable - winding tree-lined streets, big lawns, landmarks like the golf course. But back in the '90s, when Sandy Springs was still an unincorporated community, Oliver was noticing changes he didn't like.

PORTER: The county had been approving apartments left and right. So there was great concern that we were turning from a quiet residential community into a high-rise apartment community, and we didn't feel that was good for the community. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with being an apartment dweller, but in general, they don't have the same commitment as people who own their homes. They're more transient, and they haven't invested at the same level. Single-family homes are the, you know, the bedrock of a solid community.

BERAS: I should point out that at the time, 94% of homeowners in Sandy Springs were white. And 90% of renters were Black and Latino.

CHILDS: And it wasn't just apartments that Oliver was worked up about. He felt like the county was taking Sandy Springs tax dollars and spending them elsewhere.

PORTER: We used to say, you could hear the money woosh as it leaves town. You would call the county, say you had a pothole, bad situation, and they'd, you know, it'd be months, maybe years before they'd come out. They were not giving us services commensurate with our contribution.

BERAS: So there's Oliver. He's worried high-rises were going to go up all along the river. He's pissed about the potholes. And he starts imagining a very different kind of government.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: ...Half-decade, Sandy Springs residents fought to get out from under control of the county government, insisting they could do a better job of running things themselves.

CHILDS: In 2005, when Sandy Springs became its own city, Oliver set out to reinvent how a city could be run. As he saw it, the whole model of local government, with its bureaucracy and inefficiencies, was ready for disruption.

BERAS: So when he became the volunteer city manager, he hired the minimum number of employees and outsourced almost everything else. He found an engineering firm willing to take on the job of running Sandy Springs.

CHILDS: Animal control - it was contracted out. Traffic design - contracted out. Tax collection, business licenses, parking tickets, database administration - all contracted out. And it worked. Potholes weren't a problem anymore.

PORTER: The two-man crew would show up. They would have on a shirt that said Sandy Springs and a truck with a magnetic sign that said Sandy Springs, and those two men would fix that pothole. That same private crew might be working in another city the next day.

CHILDS: After this success with Sandy Springs, Oliver wanted to spread the word about what he'd done, tell people about his efficient, money-saving city. Other communities took note, and pretty soon, there were lots of new cities forming all around Atlanta - Milton, Peachtree Corners, Stonecrest - all using Oliver Porter's privatization playbook.

BERAS: Before long, delegations from all over the world were flying into Sandy Springs to see this new model city up close and personal. Oliver went to conferences, spoke to groups in Japan and Hawaii. Local newspapers gave Oliver nicknames - the guru of incorporation, the father of cities.

CHILDS: Almost 20 years after Oliver first started outsourcing most city services, it's still his brand. People call him to talk about cityhood and privatizing local government. But since 2005, the way Sandy Springs runs has changed in some pretty fundamental ways.

RUSTY PAUL: Welcome to the Flying Pig Conference Room.

BERAS: Meet Rusty Paul. There's a story behind the name of the room we're in. It goes back to when Rusty was serving in the state Senate, helping Sandy Springs become a city.

PAUL: One of my colleagues in the Senate said, there'll be a city of Sandy Springs when pigs fly. So when we became a city, we adopted the flying pig as our emblem.

CHILDS: Rusty is now the mayor of Sandy Springs. And in the years since pigs flew and Sandy Springs became a city, things have moved away from Oliver's original model where you outsource everything because over time, outsourcing everything got more expensive. When the city got new bids in 2019, it was a real turning point.

PAUL: We were in the middle of a red-hot economy, and the prices we got were a little eye-opening. And so we sat down and did some analysis and figured that we could save about $2 million from the bids we had gotten if we hired the employees and brought them in. And so we did.

BERAS: Hire city employees - lots of them - with health insurance and retirement plans and city-owned computers.

PAUL: We had to hire everybody. I mean, everything that you do in a city, you know, planners, urban foresters and arborists and, you know...

BERAS: You had to hire all those people?

PAUL: Yeah, we hired them all. We had code reviewers, code enforcement people. We got people who operate our courts, accounting - I mean, we got a whole wing of people down here who pay bills and receive money.

CHILDS: The city of Sandy Springs now employs 503 people. And Rusty says having employees will save them $14 million over five years.

BERAS: So they did all this work to privatize everything - made a huge deal about it. And now the way they're running Sandy Springs is a traditional city bureaucracy, not the model city as a business Oliver Porter likes to talk about.

CHILDS: And that's not the only part of the story that gets glossed over in Oliver's how-to-build-a-city playbook. The idea of Sandy Springs cityhood has a long history. It's been kicking around since way before Oliver even lived in Sandy Springs, since the 1960s.

BERAS: Back then, Atlanta was about 50% Black but led by white politicians who were trying to annex some of the surrounding suburbs to bring in more tax revenue and also make the city more white to keep political power. They had their eye on Sandy Springs.

CHILDS: There are recordings from that time where you hear people from Sandy Springs talking about annexation. Some of them are for it. Some are against. All of them are white, and they're talking about how to keep themselves together, separated from Black residents.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Colored people has taken us over.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: So you are willing to have Sandy Springs go into the city?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Yes, go in so when we get a decent mayor for Atlanta.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: If I wanted to live in Atlanta, we would have moved there in the first place. I think an area outside the city - if it wants to incorporate itself and be a small community with its own local government, that's fine. But I think that they should stay to themselves. The people who want to live in Atlanta can live in Atlanta.

BERAS: Some Sandy Springs residents were so against being annexed that they sent a letter to the mayor of Atlanta saying they would, quote, "build up a city separate from Atlanta and your Negroes and forbid any Negroes to buy or own or live within our limits," end quote. And that's what planted the seed for Sandy Springs cityhood.

CHILDS: So, years later, Oliver's push for cityhood was on different grounds. It was unhappiness with sharing tax revenue with apartment dwellers. But still, it felt familiar.

BERAS: Just thinking, like, how rooted was all of this, like, most - the more recent effort in those things?

PORTER: In racist issues?

BERAS: In racism and segregation...

PORTER: Not at all.

BERAS: ...And exclusion?

PORTER: Not at all. It's obviously one of the things we're always charged with. There's no truth to it whatsoever. I sat in those meetings for, as I said, about eight years, and I never heard a racial issue brought up as part of considerations. It was all about the economics. It was all about the governance.

BERAS: When you said that, like, most of the renters that lived in the apartments were people of color, and then you were talking about how there were so many apartments going up and you wanted less apartments - I mean, you could hear that and say - what you're saying is you don't want as many Black...

PORTER: Yeah, you could try to make that.

BERAS: ...Renters coming in.

PORTER: Well, let me clarify what I did say. You can try to twist something around and make that conclusion that we're being racist by opposing apartments, and that's not the case. It's just fallacious. What we were interested in is having decent apartments, decent housing and that the people there are behaving as good citizens. I don't care if they're purple, you know?

BERAS: The cities that have used Oliver's playbook - most of them have been white and well off. So even though the words have changed and race is not usually explicitly mentioned, it feels like it's inextricable from the cityhood movement.

CHILDS: Right now, there is a contentious push underway for the richest and whitest part of Atlanta, a neighborhood called Buckhead, to secede, to make its own city.

BERAS: Oliver Porter advised them. And if they succeed, they'll walk away with 40% of Atlanta's commercial and residential tax revenue. So with all of that context attached to cityhood efforts around Atlanta, what about Mableton, a mostly Black and brown community that's also trying to declare cityhood? Tre' is well aware of the history. So I asked him, how does it feel to use this model?

Does it feel like you're sort of flipping it on its head?

HUTCHINS: Well, I'm not sure, because for us it was more so how do we better our current situation? And so when we looked at it from that lens, I'm not sure that any of those other things were a factor. It was more like, this is the playbook. This is how this - can happen. And I think that's where our focus has always been.

CHILDS: He's not ambivalent about the history of local cityhood efforts. But if he can use cityhood to help his community, then OK.

BERAS: When Sandy Springs became a city, it was a white community splitting off from the larger and less white county it was a part of, to keep its resources for itself. If Mableton becomes a city, it'll be the opposite dynamic - a less well-off, mostly Black and brown community separating from the whiter county that surrounds it, striking out on its own not because they have a lot of tax revenue to fall back on, but in hopes of building something better.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
There's a corner of Cobb County, Georgia,
outside of Atlanta where you see one kind of business
over and over again.
This is a tire shop, this is another tire shop.
Tire shops, so many of them.
More tire shop to your right, tire shop next to it.
I'm driving around with Leroy Hutchins,
everyone calls him Trey.
He's lived here in Mableton, Georgia most of his life.
Three tire shops just past here on your left hand side,
right next to each other, really.
Mableton is 15 miles outside of shiny bustling Atlanta,
but you wouldn't know it if you just got plopped down here
because Mableton has a left behind feeling to it.
Tall grass along the roadsides, aging strip malls,
partly vacant with some dollar stores and pawn shops,
and all those tire shops.
We drove around for like an hour
and really do see so many, more than 20.
So is this like a destination for tire shops?
It feels like that.
But then drive a little bit further.
Go to the light and make a right.
Then let's just go down by Six Flags.
And I spot the crest of a roller coaster.
Actually, a bunch of them.
Colorful arcs surrounded by a big fence
with signs on it that read Six Flags over Georgia.
It's a huge amusement park without much around it.
No restaurants or anything, just parking lots and trees.
So like I'm looking out this window here
and I see nothing but like trees
and they're beautiful trees, I love trees.
And I see just like land.
So what is your vision for what that would look like?
Six Flags entertainment district
where people come here and they wanna stay here
for a week.
So like Disney World.
Disney is the example that we use.
In Orlando, when you drive closer
to the entrances of Disney World,
you know that you are in Disney World headquarters.
You know that.
When you drive off our exit to come to Six Flags,
there's nothing to really show you
that this is the pride jewel
of the southern portion of the county.
We can change that.
It's obviously a lot to aspire to.
The area around one small regional theme park
turning into a mini Orlando.
The way Trey sees it, what's holding Mableton back is
it's not its own city.
It's unincorporated.
It's part of the larger county
that surrounds it, Cobb County.
So a lot of things about how Mableton works
are dictated by the county,
like zoning, what kind of businesses can come here.
They control code enforcement.
So when old tires pile up outside those tire shops,
the county is supposed to give out the fines,
which Trey says isn't happening enough.
And so Trey and some other people from Mableton decided,
you know what?
Forget the county.
Let's be our own city.
But how do you make your own city?
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Erica Barris.
And I'm Mary Childs.
Today on the show, cityhood.
If you think your community deserves better,

what Mableton wants to do,
banding together and forming their own cities.
Some places want to keep their tax dollars

Others, like Mableton, are looking
for a little more say in how they run things.
It's a story about equity, exclusion,
and the power that cities can hold.
And also, potholes.

Mableton, where Trey Hutchins grew up,
is a mostly black and brown community.
The Six Flags has been there for decades.
In the 90s, Trey got his first job there,
working at a concession stand,
selling hot dogs, popcorn, sodas.
He went away for college and came back years later
to raise his kids.
And when he did, he saw so much had changed.
I just started seeing the age and the decline in the area.
And it was like, we have to do something.
And I didn't know what it was.
Things that made Mableton a nice place to live,
like the skating rink, the movie theater,
the bowling alley, they were all gone.
He saw plenty of development
in other parts of the county, but not Mableton.
And you know how every town,
as a person who has their hands in everything,
well, in Mableton, that's Trey.
You're on the school board.
Yes.
You build houses for humanity.
Right, still work in ministry.
Still work in ministry.
Do you coach teams?
Nope, that's not my forte.
I do work with a production company here in Atlanta
that puts on musicals sometimes.
You sing?
Yeah, I do sing, I do sing and dance.
So naturally, Trey starts thinking
about Mableton's development problem.
Business is closing
and new development not coming their way.
He tries to figure out why that's happening.
And what he finds out is the zoning rules
where he lives covered the entire county.
That's how it works
when you're an unincorporated community.
The county makes the rules.
And the rules in Cobb County
are designed for new development.
So they require like a certain number of parking spaces,
depending on what kind of new business is coming in.
But those rules get in the way of redeveloping places
that were built up a long time ago, like Mableton.
A lot of the shopping centers there
are smaller than what gets built now.
So there just isn't room for all the parking
that the county requires.
So auto repair shops
where you don't necessarily need a lot of parking
end up becoming the business of choice
because of the zoning.
This is how Trey eventually came around
to the idea that Mableton should be its own city.
The county is a large place, right?
This is just a small portion of the county.
And so you can't change county code
to reflect something that's just going to be specific
to the small area within the county.
And so having a city would allow us to customize zoning
so that we can specifically address some of the concerns
that we're talking about right here
through a municipality or a city ordinance
versus through the county ordinance.
If Mableton were a city,
it would have authority over some of its tax dollars.
It could make its own ordinances,
enforce its own codes,
or require less parking for new businesses coming in.
In the U.S., cities are one
of the oldest units of government.
They formed organically, like near a waterway.
The city of Philadelphia is older
than the state of Pennsylvania.
There was a time when cities
and municipalities were constantly cropping up.

many of those became their own cities.
A new city formed every three days.

tends to be more strategic.
Developers size up trends and decide where to build.
That's happening all over the South and West.
In Trey's case, Mableton has been around
for more than 100 years,
and he wants to build it back up.
For him, cityhood is a means to an end.
Was it like a moment when they're like,
we need someone to do this,
and nobody's hand went up,
and you were like, is my hand slowly creeping up?
Is my hand slowly creeping up?
So I met with friends, people I grew up with,
people I went to high school with that are still here,
and we were eating some wings and talking about it,
and then finally we were just like,
well, do you guys think this is something
we should be doing?
And they were like, well, Trey, why don't you do it?
Mableton becoming its own city
was not some far-fetched idea.
Georgia's rules for becoming a city
are pretty permissive.
If the majority of people who live inside
the proposed city boundaries support it,
vote yes, we want to be a city,
then it can happen.
There is one hurdle,
the state legislature has to sign off
on the proposed new city before it can go to ballot.
But after that, if it gets approved,
a city can be a city if it takes on just three services,
like planning and zoning or code enforcement.
Once Trey had decided
that he wanted to make Mableton a city,
there was one person he knew he had to talk to,
Oliver Porter.
Oliver lives in Sandy Springs.
It's also in the Atlanta suburbs,
about a half hour drive away.
It's kind of the model for what Trey's trying to do.
Oliver got Sandy Springs turned into a city
almost 20 years ago.
Then he self-published a book about how he did it,
which Trey got his hands on,
and then he called up Oliver.
He was like, some of the pitfalls,
some of the things not to do, you know.
What were those things?
Like, what were the things he was like?
What are the things?
Community engagement.
He said, make sure that it is focused
on community engagement.
Transparency, making sure that everything is out in the open,
making sure that even your fundraising is very inclusive
and not a developer paying for the study
or something like that.
Making sure that this is community driven
and community focused.
So Trey started talking about Mableton cityhood
with anyone he could.
He met with business owners and renters
and homeowners associations,
started raising money for a feasibility study
to prove out their plan.
We were literally sitting out in cul-de-sacs
in communities in the summertime,
talking to HOA communities about,
hey, this is what's on the table.
At this point, Mableton's gotten pretty far
in their planning.
This fall, the people who will become citizens
of the newly incorporated city
will be able to vote on the idea.
If the majority says yes, it'll go through.
If it happens, Trey's overlooked community,
it's about 70,000 people,
will have more power over itself.
And Trey believes they'll be able to put Mableton
on a better path.
Fewer tire shops, more restaurants and stores and fun.
They'll have a shot at their share of prosperity.
But the cityhood movement around Atlanta,
it started from a very different place.
That's after the break.

Now back to the show.
Oliver Porter lives at the end of a cul-de-sac
that overlooks the Chattahoochee River.
He's 85 and to get an idea of the kind of person he is,
when Oliver retired, he took up painting.
On one wall of his house,
there's a whole series of self-portraits.
You know, all of them are in different outfits.
There's Lord Porter.
Dressed up in a top hat.
Tex Porter.
Big cowboy hat.
There's a Frenchman Porter.
A beret, of course.
When Oliver decides he wants to do something,
he does it himself.
For example, he wanted an oak walnut-stained library.
One with handmade paneled walls,
shelves of cloth-bound books,
and one of those fancy rolling ladders.
So he made one in his basement.
So you built and designed all of this yourself.
I had no idea what I was doing when I was building this.
I'd never done any woodworking
or anything of this magnitude.
And I guess I felt like I wanted, so I'll just do it.
This is the same attitude that led him
to make his community of Sandy Springs into its own city.
Sandy Springs is not like Mableton.
It's the kind of place people describe as comfortable.
Winding tree-lined streets, big lawns,
landmarks like the golf course.
But back in the 90s,
when Sandy Springs was still an unincorporated community,
Oliver was noticing changes he didn't like.
The county had been a part of the city
in approving apartments left and right.
So it was great concern that we were turning
from a quiet residential community
into a high-rise apartment community.
And we didn't feel that was good for the community.
Obviously, there's nothing wrong
with being an apartment dweller,
but in general, they don't have the same commitment
as people who own their homes.
They're more transient,
and they haven't invested at the same level.
Single-family homes are the bedrock of a solid community.
I should point out that at the time,
94% of homeowners in Sandy Springs were white,
and 90% of renters were black and Latino.
And it wasn't just apartments
that Oliver was worked up about.
He felt like the county
was taking Sandy Springs' tax dollars
and spending them elsewhere.
We used to say you could hear the money whoosh
as it leaves town.
You would call the county,
say you had a pothole, bad situation,
and the months, maybe years before they'd come out,
they were not giving us services commensurate
with our contribution.
So there's Oliver.
He's worried high-rises
were gonna go up all along the river.
He's pissed about the potholes,
and he starts imagining
a very different kind of government.
Sandy Springs residents fought to get out
from under control of the county government,
insisting they could do a better job
of running things themselves.
In 2005, when Sandy Springs became its own city,
Oliver set out to reinvent how a city could be run.
As he saw it, the whole model of local government
with its bureaucracy and inefficiencies
was ready for disruption.
So when he became the volunteer city manager,
he hired the minimum number of employees
and outsourced almost everything else.
He found an engineering firm
willing to take on the job of running Sandy Springs.
Animal control, it was contracted out.
Traffic design, contracted out.
Tax collection, business licenses,
parking tickets, database administration,
all contracted out.
And it worked.
Potholes weren't a problem anymore.
The two-man crew would show up.
They would have on a shirt that said Sandy Springs,
and a truck with a magnetic sign
that said Sandy Springs,
and those two men would fix that pothole.
That same private crew might be working
in another city the next day.
After this success with Sandy Springs,
Oliver wanted to spread the word about what he'd done,
tell people about his efficient money-saving city.
Other communities took note,
and pretty soon there were lots of new cities
forming all around Atlanta.
Milton, Peachtree Corners, Stonecrest,
all using Oliver Porter's privatization playbook.
Before long, delegations from all over the world
were flying into Sandy Springs
to see this new model city up close and personal.
Oliver went to conferences,
spoke to groups in Japan and Hawaii.
Local newspapers gave Oliver nicknames.
The guru of incorporation, the father of cities.
Almost 20 years after Oliver first started
outsourcing most city surfaces, it's still his brand.
People call him to talk about cityhood
and privatizing local government.
But since 2005, the way Sandy Springs runs
has changed in some pretty fundamental ways.
Welcome to the Flying Pig conference room.
Meet Rusty Paul.
There's a story behind the name of the room we're in.
It goes back to when Rusty was serving
in the state Senate, helping Sandy Springs become a city.
One of my colleagues in the Senate said,
there'll be a city of Sandy Springs when pigs fly.
So when we became a city,
we adopted the Flying Pig as our emblem.
Rusty is now the mayor of Sandy Springs.
And in the years since pigs flew
and Sandy Springs became a city,
things have moved away from Oliver's original model
where you outsource everything.
Because over time, outsourcing everything
got more expensive.
When the city got new bids in 2019,
it was a real turning point.
We were in the middle of a red hot economy
and the prices we got were a little eye opening.
And so we sat down and did some analysis
and figured that we could save about $2 million
from the bids we had gotten
if we hired the employees and brought them in.
And so we did.
Hire city employees, lots of them,
with health insurance and retirement plans
and city owned computers.
We had to hire everybody.
I mean, everything that you do in a city,
planners, urban foresters and arborists and you know.
You had to hire all those people?
Yeah, we hired them all.
We had code reviewers, code enforcement people.
We got people who operate our courts, accounting.
I mean, we got a whole wing of people down here
who pay bills and receive money.
The city of Sandy Springs now employs 503 people.
And Rusty says having employees
will save them $14 million over five years.
So they did all this work to privatize everything,
made a huge deal about it.
And now the way they're running Sandy Springs
is a traditional city bureaucracy.
Not the model city as a business
Oliver Porter likes to talk about.
And that's not the only part of the story
that gets glossed over in Oliver's
How to Build a City Playbook.
The idea of Sandy Springs cityhood has a long history.
It's been kicking around since way before Oliver
even lived in Sandy Springs since the 1960s.
Back then Atlanta was about 50% black,
but led by white politicians who were trying to annex
some of the surrounding suburbs
to bring in more tax revenue
and also make the city more white
to keep political power.
They had their eye on Sandy Springs.
There are recordings from that time
where you hear people from Sandy Springs
talking about annexation.
Some of them are for it, some are against,
all of them are white,
and they're talking about how to keep themselves
together, separated from black residents.
Colored people is taking us over.
So you are willing to have Sandy Springs
go into the city?
Yes, go in so we can get a decent mayor
for Atlanta.
If I wanted to live in Atlanta,
we would have moved there in the first place.
I think an area outside the city,
if it wants to incorporate itself
and be a small community with its own local government,
that's fine.
But I think that they should stay to themselves.
The people who want to live in Atlanta
can live in Atlanta.
Some Sandy Springs residents
were so against being annexed
that they sent a letter to the mayor of Atlanta
saying they would, quote,
build up a city separate from Atlanta
and your Negroes and forbid any Negroes
to buy or own or live within our limits, end quote.
And that's what planted the seed
for Sandy Springs cityhood.
So years later,
Oliver's push for cityhood was on different grounds.
It was unhappiness with sharing tax revenue,
with apartment dwellers,
but still it felt familiar.
Just thinking like how rooted was all of this,
like most of the more recent effort in those things?
In racist issues?
In racism, in segregation?
Not at all.
Exclusion?
Not at all.
It's obviously one of the things
we're always charged with.
There's no truth to it whatsoever.
I sat in those meetings for, as I said,
about eight years
and I never heard a racial issue brought up
as part of considerations.
It was all about the economics.
It was all about the governance.
When you said that like most of the renters
that lived in the apartments were people of color,
and then you were talking about
how there were so many apartments going up
and you wanted less apartments.
I mean, you could hear that and say,
what you're saying is you don't want as many black.
Yeah, you could try to make that.
Well, let me clarify what I did say.
You can try to twist something around
and make that conclusion that we're being racist
by opposing apartments and that's not the case.
It's just fallacious.
What we're interested in is having decent apartments,
decent housing, and that the people there
are behaving as good citizens.
I don't care if they're purple, you know?
The cities that have used Oliver's playbook,
most of them have been white and well-off.
So even though the words have changed
and race is not usually explicitly mentioned,
it feels like it's inextricable from the cityhood movement.
Right now, there is a contentious push underway
for the richest and whitest part of Atlanta,
a neighborhood called Buckhead,
to secede, to make its own city.
Oliver Porter advised them and if they succeed,
they'll walk away with 40% of Atlanta's commercial
and residential tax revenue.
So with all of that context attached
to cityhood efforts around Atlanta,
what about Mableton, a mostly black and brown community
that's also trying to declare cityhood?
Trey's well aware of the history.
So I asked him, how does it feel to use this model?
Does it feel like you're sort of flipping it on its head?
Well, I'm not sure, because for us,
it was more so how do we better our current situation?
And so when we looked at it from that lens,
I'm not sure that any of those other things were a factor.
It was more like this is the playbook.
This is how this can happen.
And I think that's where our focus has always been.
He's not ambivalent about the history
of local cityhood efforts,
but if he can use cityhood to help his community,
then okay.
When Sandy Springs became a city,
it was a white community splitting off
from the larger and less white county it was a part of.
It's trying to keep its resources for itself.
If Mableton becomes a city,
it'll be the opposite dynamic.
A less well off, mostly black and brown community
separating from the whiter county that surrounds it.
Striking out on its own,
not because they have a lot of tax revenue
to fall back on,
but in hopes of building something better.
