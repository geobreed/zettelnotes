A wave of companies that allow customers to pay for items from their favorite stores in four interest-free installments has taken over the country. But is "buy now, pay later" lending too good to be true? | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

When Amelia Schmarzo's dad helped set up a credit card for her to use while away at college, he told her it was only for essentials and emergencies. And Amelia barely touched the card ... until she discovered a new kind of payment called "buy now, pay later."

The pitch was simple: get whatever you want now, and pay it back in four, interest-free installments. Suddenly, Amelia started buying all kinds of things using buy now, pay later. And she failed to notice that her small installments were quickly piling up. It only took a month before her credit card was maxed out.

Buy now, pay later companies like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have taken the country by storm ever since the pandemic fueled an online shopping explosion. But offering customers the option to pay for anything from clothes to oral surgery in interest-free installments sounds almost too good to be true, right?

Today on the show, what exactly is buy now, pay later? And should we be worried?

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:

This is the story of how Amelia Schmarzo fell into a kind of rabbit hole - one that involved a lot of online shopping. But the story isn't about the stuff she bought as much as the new way she found to pay for that stuff. It starts a couple years ago, in the spring of 2020, when Amelia found herself, like so many of us, locked down at home, bored, scared, going a little stir-crazy.

AMELIA SCHMARZO: I was like, who am I? Like, what is going on? Like, oh, my gosh, did I hit a midlife crisis at the age of 20? I was like, I need to find new passions that I can - new hobbies to keep myself busy.

TAYLOR WASHINGTON, HOST:

So Amelia's a junior in college. She's living in an apartment in San Diego. And she started doing these at-home exercise videos that were made by influencers she saw on social media.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED INFLUENCER #1: Good morning, everyone, and welcome back to my channel. In today's video...

UNIDENTIFIED INFLUENCER #2: We have three-pound, 10-pound and 20-pound weights.

UNIDENTIFIED INFLUENCER #3: I, like, swear, these are what makes your butt grow.

SCHMARZO: And then I found influencers who follow these influencers, and so that is how I kind of got into the realm of getting influenced by influencers.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's how you fell under the influence.

SCHMARZO: Absolutely.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Amelia says the lives of these trendy jet-setting zoomers just felt so glamorous.

WASHINGTON: And she's like, maybe if I get the right clothes and accessories, maybe my life could be more like that. I mean, we've all been there.

SCHMARZO: They look pretty. They look confident. I want those words - people to describe me as that.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: A lot of the influencers Amelia is following are constantly showing off their new outfits.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED INFLUENCER #4: ...Back to my channel. Today, I have a summer clothing haul for you guys, and I've been...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Then, there'll be a link to the websites where you can buy exactly what they're wearing. And in one of these videos, Amelia sees the bikini.

SCHMARZO: Oh, yeah. It was literally, like, a white and brown tie-dye bikini.

WASHINGTON: It doesn't sound that special. But to Amelia, it felt like the first step to reinventing herself. So she clicked the link.

SCHMARZO: The price was somewhere around $200 for the bikini.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And had you ever spent that kind of money on a piece of clothing before?

SCHMARZO: No, not even close.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But then, Amelia notices an offer in small type just below the total - four interest-free payments of $41.99 with Afterpay.

SCHMARZO: It just felt so cheap. You know, I was like, that is so affordable, $41.99. And if I sat there and I genuinely was like, $41.99 times four, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

SCHMARZO: But I was like, oh, I'm easily going to get $41 next month. Like, that's nothing to worry about.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So suddenly, the most expensive garment you've kind of considered buying feels like it's actually a bit of a bargain?

SCHMARZO: It really does.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You're like, I just lucked into a kind of a steal.

SCHMARZO: I'm like, wow, I'm paying $41 for a $200 bikini. Like, I am a genius.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This was Amelia's first experience with a kind of payment called buy now, pay later. After an extremely cursory credit check - the kind that won't affect her credit score - she's approved, clicks the purchase button. The company, Afterpay, charges her card for the first installment.

WASHINGTON: They accept credit or debit. She chooses credit.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And the bikini is on its way. The process was that simple. And so a few days later, when she sees another influencer showing off something else she liked...

(SOUNDBITE OF SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO)

UNIDENTIFIED INFLUENCER #5: So I guess we'll start off with my most favorite pair of sneaker that I own.

WASHINGTON: Amelia clicks the link, and again, she sees that buy now, pay later option.

SCHMARZO: It literally made the price like - I kid you not - like, $8. So in that mindset, I was like, oh, my gosh, I can afford the world. And so I - that's why I threw in that swimsuit, and I threw in the jacket and the jeans and...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Hit me.

SCHMARZO: Yeah, right? I'm like, put them all in the cart.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

SCHMARZO: And my total was literally, like, $20.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So how does this pick up? Like, is it over the next, like, couple weeks? Is it months?

SCHMARZO: I would say days, to be honest.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDERS JOHAN GREGER LEWEN'S "RETRO FUNK")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Before she knows it, Amelia has fallen into a kind of shopping spiral.

SCHMARZO: I got, like, a whole bunch of, like, really nice jeans from Aritzia...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: She got fancy sweatpants, sweatshirts...

SCHMARZO: ...Sweats, because sweat sets were super in - right? - because you weren't leaving the house. So I got...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: ...A bunch of new shoes...

SCHMARZO: ...Brand-new high heels, Jordans, Yeezys.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANDERS JOHAN GREGER LEWEN'S "RETRO FUNK")

SCHMARZO: Buying stuff online was the only thing that really gave me that, like, adrenaline - you know what I mean? - when it came in the mail because there was nothing else going on. It was so exciting. It felt like Christmas.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Amelia says all of the packages arriving on her doorstep felt kind of like gifts, like some mysterious stranger was footing the bill for everything on her list just out of the goodness of their corporate heart.

SCHMARZO: I'm not going to lie - it felt free. Like, it literally felt like free money because I didn't see it. It wasn't cash. I don't know, it just felt like it was never going to catch up. It just all felt like Monopoly money.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So you're, like, watching "Tiger King," mashing that...

SCHMARZO: Yeah.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: ...That buy now, pay later button.

SCHMARZO: (Laughter) Yeah. Life was good (laughter).

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What was the first sign that trouble might be brewing?

SCHMARZO: I didn't think about it literally until I got an email from Discovery saying, your statement is ready to be viewed.

WASHINGTON: One thing to know about Amelia - before she started using buy now, pay later, she was pretty allergic to using her credit card at all. It was one her dad helped set up for essentials and emergencies, and her statement had only ever been a few hundred dollars at the very most. But this time...

SCHMARZO: I saw that it was $2,000, which was my limit.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh.

SCHMARZO: And then I saw my debit card went from $700 to, like, $20.

(SOUNDBITE OF DALLAS RAMIREZ'S "COMIN' BACK FOR MORE")

SCHMARZO: And that's when I was like, I am going to throw up. Like, how did this happen?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.

WASHINGTON: And I'm Taylor Washington.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: At its most basic, a loan is a way to get money now in return for a little bit extra...

WASHINGTON: Or a lot.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: ...When you pay it back down the road. That's been true as far back as - I don't know - ancient Babylon. But all of a sudden, over the past couple years, there's been an explosion of new companies offering what is essentially free money - a no-interest loan.

WASHINGTON: Today on the show, what exactly is buy now, pay later, how it works, and why it seems to be everywhere - and should we be worried?

(SOUNDBITE OF DALLAS RAMIREZ'S "COMIN' BACK FOR MORE")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: OK. So Taylor Washington, you are a producer here on the show.

WASHINGTON: Yep.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And you first brought up buy now, pay later in one of our editorial meetings a while back.

WASHINGTON: Yeah, so I heard about it a while ago because all of a sudden, I saw a ton of people my age - you know, fellow zoomers were using it.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yes.

WASHINGTON: And they were going on these crazy shopping sprees all over TikTok. A lot of people were jumping in headfirst, just like Amelia, and so it seemed like something we should look into.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Right, OK. And we will get back to Amelia's story in a bit. But Taylor, what I remember from when you first pitched this was that a lot of us kind of knew what you were talking about - like, we'd seen these buy now, pay later options online - but nobody really understood, like, how it actually works.

WASHINGTON: Yeah, so people started talking about payday loans or rent-to-own or layaway because with layaway, you also pay in installments, but you don't get the thing until it's paid off.

TERRI BRADFORD: Yeah. That's what buy now, pay later feels like - good old-fashioned layaway.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This is Terri Bradford. She's a payments expert at the Kansas City Fed. And a couple years ago, she and her colleague, Julian...

JULIAN ALCAZAR: Julian Alcazar - I also work at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They teamed up to start looking into buy now, pay later.

How would you kind of describe your dynamic as a duo? Are you more of like a Batman and Robin-style thing? Are you like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, like...

BRADFORD: You know what? I would say we're Woodward and Bernstein. How about that?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Ooh, yeah. Those are terms that we can understand.

OK. So when our financial Woodward and Bernstein started looking into buy now, pay later a couple years ago, the business model was still a bit of a mystery to them. But one thing was clear.

ALCAZAR: It's credit by another name.

BRADFORD: That's what it is, yeah. So it's not unlike, I guess, buying a car or buying a house. The difference is, you aren't paying interest, you know?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah, yeah.

BRADFORD: It almost is, like, too good to be true.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Too good to be true because here's what most buy now, pay later companies are offering. They're saying as long as you are able to clear a pretty low bar, like a soft credit check that won't show up on your credit score, they will spot you the money for whatever you're buying. You agreed to pay them back in four installments.

WASHINGTON: They collect the money from whatever bank account or debit or credit card you want, and those payments are all interest free.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Which raises a pretty big question - if most customers are not paying any interest...

BRADFORD: How are you making money on this? Interest-free loans - where's the value proposition in that?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

BRADFORD: So where was the money coming from, right?

WASHINGTON: Right. Where was the money coming from? Lending money is usually a big moneymaker because of some combination of interest and fees.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But when Terri and Julian peeked under the hood of the business model, not only are the companies not charging interest, the fees generally aren't super high, either. So for customers, as long as they don't buy more than they can afford - which is obviously a big if - these loans can be a great deal - basically, the cheapest money you can get.

ALCAZAR: I was always expecting this gotcha moment.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

ALCAZAR: And it wasn't coming around. So I was very - it's like, where's the surprise? I was - you know, when you watch a scary movie, and you could hear the suspenseful music, and then there's...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh, yeah.

ALCAZAR: ...Michael Myers behind the door? That's what I was expecting.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The gotcha moment was not what they expected. Instead of making money by gouging their customers with hidden fees, it turned out buy now, pay later companies were taking their cut from the other side of the transaction - from the businesses actually selling the goods.

ALCAZAR: So it goes between 4 and as high as 9 1/2%...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Wow.

ALCAZAR: ...Is what merchants are paying buy now, pay later firms.

WASHINGTON: Credit card companies usually charge merchants anywhere from 2 to 4%. So buy now, pay later companies are often asking for a way bigger cut.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So I just want to break this down clearly. They're saying, we're going to charge you around double of what credit cards charge per item that you sell using our payment service.

BRADFORD: Yeah, it doesn't quite seem to jive, does it?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What makes it jive is that credit card charges are widely variable, depending on whether it's a MasterCard or an Amex or a Visa and whether there are rewards. It makes things harder to predict. Also, credit cards come with these pesky consumer protections that put businesses on the hook if customers complain.

BRADFORD: So if something goes wrong and the product that they bought broke or it didn't perform to their satisfaction, they have the right to request a chargeback. And so the merchant could have that whole amount that they'd received withdrawn by the credit card company because the customer said the product was no good for them.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Right. So if you've ever asked your credit card company for a refund because the thing you bought turned out to be junk, that's what she's talking about. That can be a big pain for businesses.

WASHINGTON: But the biggest reason that businesses are signing up for buy now, pay later is that it's helping them sell more stuff - for example, by bringing in a new pool of customers.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Because what Terri and Julian saw as they dug through pitch decks and advertisements and influencer videos was that, at first, buy now, pay later companies were targeting a pretty specific demographic. They wanted to offer small loans at the point of sale to reach people who don't usually buy on credit.

WASHINGTON: Which is actually a lot of people - for example, people who don't have much of a credit history, people who have bad credit or people like Amelia, who grew up during and after the financial crisis and are more reluctant to use credit cards at all.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: All of those people might not have bought anything without buy now, pay later. So not only are businesses getting new customers, but many of those customers are young. As they get older, they'll likely earn more money, and they might come back and spend it.

WASHINGTON: On top of that, Julian says buy now, pay later helps retailers with the problem they call cart abandonment.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Which will be familiar to almost anyone who's shopped online.

ALCAZAR: Most consumers will put items in their virtual shopping cart, and then when it comes time to check out, they'll be like, I don't need to spend $200. And so what buy now, pay later does - it actually reduces cart abandonment because it makes large purchases seem smaller to the consumer.

WASHINGTON: Remember Amelia and her Monopoly money? The lower price tag can lead people to buy more than they would have otherwise.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now, buy now, pay later has been growing in the U.S. since at least 2015. But it reached critical mass at the perfect moment, just as the pandemic set in. All of a sudden, online retail exploded. And, Terri says, so did the number of buy now, pay later services.

BRADFORD: It was Afterpay and Affirm and Klarna and Sezzle and Zip. Like, how many of these things are there?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

BRADFORD: And you were also hearing about the partnerships that they were beginning to form with large merchants, like Amazon, for example, and Target. And it was kind of like, OK; wait a minute. What is happening? And they're popping up absolutely everywhere.

WASHINGTON: Buy now, pay later was no longer this niche thing mostly targeting young people allergic to credit by partnering with trendy brands. It was the new form of payment for all kinds of purchases.

ALCAZAR: One thing that I found is that there's a buy now, pay later firm for just about anything, from small business to medium-size business financing to auto repair to helping you remodel your home in four easy payments to even health care.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

ALCAZAR: This might be TMI, but I had to get my wisdom teeth taken out. And my dentist can take my wisdom teeth out using buy now, pay later.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Wow.

ALCAZAR: And that was wild. That's where was I like, this is a little much.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And talk about Deep Throat.

BRADFORD: Ha.

ALCAZAR: Ha.

BRADFORD: There you go. We've looped back around.

(LAUGHTER)

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So when our investigators take a step back, here is what they see. Buy now, pay later is finding its way into more and more corners of the economy. It can be a pretty good deal for customers. And it looks pretty good for businesses. But you know who is not totally thrilled, besides Amelia, of course?

WASHINGTON: Credit card companies and some of the big banks behind them.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What they've been doing to fight back after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL TYAN'S "REACTIVE EMOTION")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Loans are basically the oldest financial technology in the book. But since the 1960s, when you think about how people pay with credit for everyday things, you usually think about credit cards. So you can imagine how threatening this explosion of buy now, pay later was to stodgy old banks and credit card companies.

ALCAZAR: There was one report that showed that banks lost between $8 billion and $10 billion in revenue to buy now, pay later offerings.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Wow.

WASHINGTON: Because as buy now, pay later grew more popular, a lot of people started using it instead of credit cards, which means a lot less transaction fees and interest payments for the credit card companies and the banks behind them. And those banks - they obviously weren't going to stand for it.

BRADFORD: Financial institutions don't generally just sit back and let things happen to them.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And so the banks and credit card companies are trying to fend off this horde of new competitors. At least one bank, Capital One, is refusing to let their credit cards be used for most buy now, pay later purchases. But for the most part, banks and credit card companies are getting in on the action. They're acquiring buy now, pay later companies outright or rolling out their own services that look a lot like buy now, pay later. And this is why it is now possible to buy your plane ticket to go get your wisdom teeth removed...

WASHINGTON: While wearing your new Yeezys.

ALCAZAR: ...And pay for it all later. And the way the system is currently set up, a lot of that spending does not get reported to the credit bureaus.

WASHINGTON: Which brings us to the part of buy now, pay later that got Amelia into trouble. Every time she chose to pay later, she was taking out a little loan for the sneakers or the sundress or whatever. But the company giving her that little loan had no idea how many other little loans she had already taken out from other buy now, pay later companies.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And this is where people like Terri and Julian and now the federal government see the greatest potential danger.

ALCAZAR: One of the things that really set off the alarms was the opportunity for overextension from the consumer because when compared to a traditional credit card or even personal loan, they will check if you have good or no credit...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Yeah.

ALCAZAR: ...Or if you have outstanding loans. Buy now, pay later firms had no idea how many buy now, pay later products a consumer was using. So the opportunity to stack - it was fairly easy.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The same thing happened with credit cards when they first came on the scene in the 1960s. This new kind of credit became available to more and more people. And it was so different from what was possible before, so unregulated, that there were a lot of Amelias - a lot of people who got in over their heads, spent more than they can afford.

WASHINGTON: That's part of why back in the '70s Congress passed sweeping consumer credit laws. And right now it seems to be buy now, pay later's turn. Like, last fall, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing looking into the promise and potential pitfalls of buy now, pay later.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: For example, how buy now, pay later interacts with the existing credit reporting system - because part of the promise of buy now, pay later is the fact that it makes cheap credit available to people who, for one reason or another, can't get it otherwise.

WASHINGTON: But those same people mostly can improve their credit scores by using it because right now credit bureaus usually only find out about your short-term buy now, pay later loans if you don't pay them and they go to collections, which means, at the moment, using buy now, pay later is more likely to hurt your credit score than help it.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: As of December, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, is doing its own inquiry. They're figuring out how buy now, pay later companies fit into existing credit regulations, what kinds of data are being harvested and how it's being used. And, of course, they are mapping out the risks they may present to the people who use them.

WASHINGTON: People like Amelia.

SCHMARZO: You know when you're just in a state of panic? Like, you just have so many things on your mind. I was pacing. I was sweating. I was crying. So I was like, that's it. I have to call my dad.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The last we heard from her, Amelia had just discovered that she'd maxed out her credit card and almost emptied her checking account after around a month of buying now and paying later. She did manage to get her dad on the phone.

Did he play the dad card? Was he like, I'm not mad; I'm just disappointed?

SCHMARZO: Oh, no, no. He was mad.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: (Laughter).

SCHMARZO: He was like, I am mad. This is...

WASHINGTON: She got a whole lecture.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: He was like, Amelia, that's very dangerous. Installment payments are extremely dangerous. Like, this affects your future. He's like, you're not paying $10. You're paying $40.

WASHINGTON: He did not bail her out. Amelia had to pay off all that spending by herself.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And how did the conversation end? Like, what did you agree on?

SCHMARZO: Just to stop using it, pay off what I had to pay off and don't continue using it. Like, if you really want some that's expensive, you're going to take that money out of your savings and pay for it right then and there. You had to wait for your next paycheck. Like, I think I was like - what? - 20 at the time - 19 or 20. And he was like, you don't - you shouldn't be able to afford all this right now. And you clearly can't. So pay off what you have to do, and don't put anything else on it.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And how long did it take before you bought now and paid later again?

SCHMARZO: Like, two weeks.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: (Laughter).

SCHMARZO: I didn't learn.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Amelia says it took her a little while to dial back the habit but that she has managed to slow down. She buys now a lot less than she used to because she's learned that later can last a pretty long time.

This is the story of how Amelia Schmarzo fell into a kind of rabbit hole, one that
involved a lot of online shopping.
But the story isn't about the stuff she bought as much as the new way she found to pay for
that stuff.
It starts a couple years ago, in the spring of 2020, when Amelia found herself, like so
many of us, locked down at home, bored, scared, going a little stir-crazy.
I was like, who am I?
Like, what is going on?
Like, oh my gosh, did I hit a midlife crisis at the age of 20?
I was like, I need to find new passions that I can, new hobbies to keep myself busy.
So Amelia's a junior in college.
She's living in an apartment in San Diego, and she started doing these at-home exercise
videos that were made by influencers she saw on social media.
Good morning, everyone, and welcome back to my channel, and today's video...
I have 3 pound, 10 pound, and 20 pound weights.
I like swear these are what makes your butt grow.
And then I found influencers who follow these influencers, and so that is how I
kind of got into the realm of getting influenced by influencers.
That's how you fell under the influence.
Absolutely.
Amelia says the lives of these trendy, jet-setting Zoomers just felt so glamorous.
And she's like, maybe if I get the right clothes and accessories, maybe my life could
be more like that.
I mean, we've all been there.
They look pretty, they look confident.
I want those words, people, to describe me as that.
A lot of the influencers Amelia is following are constantly showing off their new outfits.
Back to my channel, today I have a summer clothing haul for you guys.
Then there will be a link to the websites where you can buy exactly what they're wearing.
And in one of these videos, Amelia sees the bikini.
Oh yeah, it was literally like a white and brown tie-dye bikini.
It doesn't sound that special, but to Amelia, it felt like the first step to reinventing
herself.
So, she clicked the link.
The price was somewhere around $200 for the bikini.
And had you ever spent that kind of money on a piece of clothing before?
No, not even close.
But then Amelia notices an offer in small type just below the total.
Four interest-free payments of $41.99 with after pay.
It just felt so cheap, you know, I was like, that is so affordable.
$41.99.
And if I sat there and I genuinely was like $41.99 times four, I probably wouldn't
have bought it, but I was like, oh, I'm easily going to get $41 next month.
Like, that's nothing to worry about.
So suddenly, the most expensive garment you've kind of considered buying feels like it's
actually a bit of a bargain.
It really does.
You're like, I just lucked into a kind of a steal.
I'm like, wow, I'm paying $41 for a $200 bikini.
Like I am a genius.
This was Amelia's first experience with a kind of payment called buy now pay later.
After an extremely cursory credit check, the kind that won't affect her credit score,
She's approved, clicks the purchase button.
The company after pay charges her card for the first installment.
They accept credit or debit.
She chooses credit.
And the bikini is on its way.
The process was that simple.
And so a few days later, when she sees another influencer showing off something
else she liked.
So I guess we'll start off with my most favorite pair of sneaker that I own.
Amelia clicks the link.
And again, she sees that buy now pay later option.
It literally made the price like, I kid you not like $8.
So in that mindset, I was like, oh my gosh, I can afford the world.
And so I, that's why I threw in that swimsuit and I threw in the jacket and the jeans
and hit me.
Yeah.
Right.
I put them all in the cart.
Yeah.
And my total was literally like $20.
So how, how does this pick up?
Like is it over the next like couple of weeks?
Is it months?
I would say days, to be honest.
Before she knows it, Amelia has fallen into a kind of shopping spiral.
I got like a whole bunch of like really nice jeans from Aritzia.
She got fancy sweatpants, sweatshirts, cause sweatsets were super in, right?
Cause you weren't leaving the house.
So I got a bunch of new shoes, brand new high heels, Jordans, Yeezys.
Buying stuff online was the only thing that really gave me that like adrenaline.
You know what I mean?
When it came in the mail, because there was nothing else going on, it was so
exciting.
It felt like Christmas.
Amelia says all of the packages arriving on her doorstep felt kind of like gifts.
Like some mysterious stranger was footing the bill for everything on her list, just
out of the goodness of their corporate heart.
I'm not gonna lie.
It felt free.
Like it literally felt like free money because I didn't see it.
It wasn't cash.
I don't know.
It just felt like it was never going to catch up.
It just all felt like monopoly money.
So you're like watching Tiger King mashing that, that buy now, pay later button.
Life was good.
What was the first sign that trouble might be brewing?
I didn't think about it literally until I got an email from discover saying your
statement is ready to be viewed.
One thing to know about Amelia, before she started using buy now, pay later,
she was pretty allergic to using her credit card at all.
It was one her dad helped set up for essentials and emergencies and her statement
It had only ever been a few hundred dollars at the very most.
But this time
I saw that it was $2,000, which was my limit.
And then I saw my debit card went from $700 to like $20.
And that's when I was like, I am going to throw up.
How did this happen?
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.
And I'm Taylor Washington.
At its most basic, a loan is a way to get money now in return for a little bit extra.
Or a lot.
When you pay it back down the road.
That's been true as far back as, I don't know, ancient Babylon.
But all of a sudden over the past couple of years, there's been an explosion of
new companies offering what is essentially free money, a no interest loan.
Today on the show, what exactly is buy now, pay later?
How it works and why it seems to be everywhere.
And should we be worried?

Okay, so Taylor Washington, you are a producer here on the show.
Yep.
And you first brought up buy now, pay later in one of our editorial meetings
a while back.
So I heard about it a while ago because all of a sudden I saw a ton of people my
age, you know, fellow Zoomers were using it and they were going on these crazy
shopping sprees all over TikTok.
A lot of people jumping in head first, just like Amelia.
And so it seems like something we should look into.
Right. Okay.
And we will get back to Amelia's story in a bit.
But Taylor, what I remember from when you first pitched this was that a lot
of us kind of knew what you were talking about.
Like we'd seen these buy now, pay later options online, but nobody really
understood like how it actually works.
Yeah. So people started talking about payday loans or rent to own or lay away
because with layaway you also pay in installments, but you don't get the
thing until it's paid off.
Yeah, that's what buy now pay later feels like good old fashioned layaway.
This is Terry Bradford.
She's a payments expert at the Kansas City Fed.
And a couple of years ago, she and her colleague Julian.
Liana Casar. I also work at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
They teamed up to start looking into buy now pay later.
How would you kind of describe your dynamic as a duo?
Are you more like a Batman and Robin style thing?
Are you like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson?
Like, you know what?
I would say we're Woodward and Bernstein.
How about that?
Ooh, yeah.
Those are terms that we can understand.
Okay.
So when our financial Woodward and Bernstein started looking into buy
now pay later a couple of years ago, the business model was still a
bit of a mystery to them.
But one thing was clear.
It's credit by another name.
That's what it is.
Yeah.
So it's not unlike, I guess, buying a car or buying a house.
The difference is you aren't paying interest.
You know, it almost is like too good to be true.
Too good to be true because here's what most buy now pay later
companies are offering.
They're saying as long as you are able to clear a pretty low bar,
like a soft credit check that won't show up on your credit score,
they will spot you the money for whatever you're buying.
You agree to pay them back in four installments.
They collect the money from whatever bank account or debit or
credit card you want.
And those payments are all interest free.
Which raises a pretty big question.
If most customers are not paying any interest.
How are you making money on this?
Um, interest free loans.
Where's, where's the value proposition in that?
Yeah.
So where was the money coming from?
Right?
Right.
Where was the money coming from?
Lending money is usually a big moneymaker because of some
combination of interest and fees.
But when Terry and Julianne peaked under the hood of the
business model, not only are the companies not charging
interest, the fees generally aren't super high either.
So for customers, as long as they don't buy more than they
can afford, which is obviously a big if these loans can be a
great deal, basically the cheapest money you can get.
I was always expecting this gotcha moment and it wasn't
coming around.
So I was, I was very, it's like, where, where's the surprise?
I was, you know, when you watch a scary movie and you
could hear the suspenseful music and then there's Michael
Myers behind the door.
That's what I was expecting.
The gotcha moment was not what they expected.
Instead of making money by gouging their customers with
hidden fees, it turned out buy now pay later companies were
taking their cut from the other side of the transaction, from
the businesses actually selling the goods.
So it goes between four and as high as nine and a half
percent is what merchants are paying buy now pay later
firms.
Credit card companies usually charge merchants anywhere
from two to 4%.
So buy now pay later companies are often asking for
a way bigger cut.
So I just want to break this down clearly.
They're saying we're going to charge you around double
of what credit cards charge per item that you sell using our
payment service.
Yeah, it doesn't quite seem to jive does it?
What makes it jive is that credit card charges are widely
variable depending on whether it's a MasterCard or an
Amex or a Visa and whether there are rewards.
It makes things harder to predict.
Also credit cards come with these pesky consumer
protections that put businesses on the hook if
customers complain.
So if something goes wrong in the product that they
bought broke or didn't perform to their satisfaction,
they have the right to request a charge back.
And so the merchant could have that whole amount
that they'd received withdrawn by the credit
card company because the customer said the product
was no good for them.
Right.
So if you've ever asked your credit card company for
a refund because the thing you bought turned out to
be junk, that's what she's talking about.
That can be a big pain for businesses.
But the biggest reason that businesses are signing up
for buy now pay later is that it's helping them
sell more stuff.
For example, by bringing in a new pool of customers.
Because what Terry and Julian saw as they dug
through pitch decks and advertisements and influencer
videos was that at first buy now pay later
companies were targeting a pretty specific
demographic.
They wanted to offer small loans at the point of
sale to reach people who don't usually buy on
credit, which is actually a lot of people.
For example, people who don't have much of a
credit history, people who have bad credit or
people like Amelia who grew up during and after
the financial crisis and are more reluctant to use
credit cards at all.
All of those people might not have bought anything
without buy now pay later.
So not only our business is getting new
customers, but many of those customers are young.
As they get older, they'll likely earn more
money and they might come back and spend it.
On top of that, Julian says buy now pay later
helps retailers with the problem they call
cart abandonment, which will be familiar to almost
anyone who's shopped online.
Most consumers will put items in their virtual
shopping cart and then when it comes time to
check out, they'll be like, I don't need to
spend $200.
And so what buy now pay later does, it
actually reduces cart abandonment because it
makes large purchases seem smaller to the
consumer.
Remember Amelia and her Monopoly money?
The lower price tag can lead people to buy more
than they will have otherwise.
Now buy now pay later has been growing in the
U.S. since at least 2015, but it reached
critical mass at the perfect moment just as
the pandemic set in.
All of a sudden online retail exploded and
Terry says so did the number of buy now pay
later services.
It was after pay and Affirm and Klarna and
Zezel and Zip.
Like how many of these things are there?
Yeah.
And you were also hearing about the
partnerships that they were beginning to form
with large merchants like Amazon, for
example, and Target.
And it was kind of like, OK, wait a minute,
what is happening?
And they're popping up absolutely everywhere.
Buy now pay later was no longer this niche
thing, mostly targeting young people allergic
to credit by partnering with trendy brands.
It was the new form of payment for all
kinds of purchases.
One thing that I found is that there's a
buy now pay later firm for just about
anything from small business to medium
size business financing to auto repair, to
helping you remodel your home and for easy
payments to even health care.
Yeah, this might be TMI.
I had to get my wisdom teeth taken out
and my dentist can take my wisdom teeth
out using buy now pay later.
And that was wild.
That's where I was like, this is a
little much.
And talk about deep throat.
There you go.
We've looped back around.
So when our investigators take a step
back, here is what they see.
Buy now pay later is finding its way
into more and more corners of the
economy.
It can be a pretty good deal for
customers and it looks pretty good
for businesses.
But you know who is not totally thrilled
besides Amelia, of course, credit card
companies and some of the big banks
behind them, what they've been doing
to fight back after the break.
Loans are basically the oldest
financial technology in the book.
But since the 1960s, when you think
about how people pay with credit for
everyday things, you usually think
about credit cards.
So you can imagine how threatening
this explosion of buy now pay later
was to stodgy old banks and credit
card companies.
There was one report that showed that
banks lost between eight and ten
billion dollars in revenue to buy
now pay later offerings.
Wow.
Because this buy now pay later grew
more popular.
A lot of people started using it
instead of credit cards, which means
a lot less transaction fees and
interest payments for the credit
card companies and the banks
behind them.
In those banks, they obviously
weren't going to stand for it.
Financial institutions don't generally
just sit back and let things
happen to them.
And so the banks and credit card
companies are trying to fend off
this horde of new competitors.
At least one bank, Capital One, is
refusing to let their credit cards
be used for most buy now pay
later purchases.
But for the most part, banks and
credit card companies are getting
in on the action.
They're acquiring buy now pay
later companies outright or
rolling out their own services
that look a lot like buy now pay
later.
And this is why it is now possible
to buy your plane ticket to
go get your wisdom teeth removed
while wearing your new Yeezys
and pay for it all later.
And the way the system is
currently set up, a lot of that
spending does not get reported
to the credit bureaus.
Which brings us to the part of
buy now pay later that got
Amelia into trouble.
Every time she chose to pay
later, she was taking out a
little loan for the sneakers or
the sundress or whatever.
But the company giving her that
little loan had no idea how
many other little loans she had
already taken out from other
buy now pay later companies.
And this is where people like
Terry and Julian and now the
federal government see the
greatest potential danger.
One of the things that really
set off the alarms was the
opportunity for overextension
from the consumer, because when
compared to a traditional credit
card or even personal loan,
they will check if you have
good or no credit or if you
have outstanding loans.
Buy now pay later firms had no
idea how many buy now pay later
products a consumer was using.
So the opportunity to stack it
was fairly easy.
The same thing happened with
credit cards when they first
came on the scene in the
1960s.
This new kind of credit
became available to more and
more people.
And it was so different from
what was possible before, so
unregulated that there were a
lot of Amelia's, a lot of
people who got in over their
heads spent more than they can
afford.
That's part of why back in the
70s, Congress passed sweeping
consumer credit laws.
And right now it seems to be
buy now pay later's turn.
Like last fall, the House
Financial Services Committee
held a hearing looking into
the promise and potential
pitfalls of buy now pay
later.
For example, how buy now pay
later interacts with the
existing credit reporting
system.
Because part of the promise of
buy now pay later is the
fact that it makes cheap
credit available to people
who for one reason or another
can't get it otherwise.
But those same people mostly
can't improve their credit
scores by using it.
Because right now credit
bureaus usually only find
out about your short term buy
now pay later loans if you
don't pay them and they go
to collections.
Which means at the moment
using buy now pay later is
more likely to hurt your
credit score than help it.
As of December, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, the
CFPB, is doing its own
inquiry.
They're figuring out how buy
now pay later companies fit
into existing credit
regulations.
What kinds of data are being
harvested and how it's being
used.
And of course they are
mapping out the risks they
may present to the people
who use them.
People like Amelia.
You know when you're just in
a state of panic like you
just just have so many
things on your mind.
I was pacing.
I was sweating.
I was crying.
So I was like that's it.
I have to call my dad.
The last we heard from her
Amelia had just discovered
that she'd maxed out her credit
card and almost emptied her
checking account after around a
month of buying now and paying
later.
She did manage to get her dad
on the phone.
Did he play the dad card was
he like I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.
Oh no no he was mad.
He was like I am mad.
She got a whole lecture.
He was like Amelia that's
very dangerous installment
payments are extremely
dangerous.
Like this affects your future
is like you're not paying
ten dollars you're paying
forty dollars.
He did not bail her out.
Amelia had to pay off all that
spending by herself.
And how did the conversation
end.
Like what did you what did you
agree on just to stop using
it pay off what I had to pay
off and don't continue using
it.
Like if you really want
something that's expensive
you're going to have to take
that money out of your
savings and pay for it
right then and there got to
wait for your next paycheck.
Like I think I was like what
20 at the time and 19 or 20
and he was like you don't
you shouldn't be able to
afford all this right now and
you clearly can't.
So pay off what you have to
do and don't put anything
else on it.
And how long did it take
before you bought now and
paid later again.
Like two weeks.
I didn't learn.
Amelia says it took her a
little while to dial back
the habit but that she
has managed to slow down.
She buys now a lot less
than she used to because
she's learned that later can
last a pretty long time.
