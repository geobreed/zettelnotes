Soon after the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999, leaders of the National Rifle Association held a conference call to craft their response. Secret tapes from this call obtained by NPR's Investigations team reveal how the NRA developed what would become their standard response after decades of school shootings. | Listen to the original Up First episode: n.pr/nratapes

Around the same time, leaders discussed how to respond to the shooting at Columbine High School in nearby Littleton, Colo. More than 20 years later, NPR has obtained secret recordings of those conversations.

Note: This episode of Up First originally ran in 2021.

A lone gunman killed 19 students and two adults at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas on Tuesday. The National Rifle Association is set to host its annual convention in Houston, Texas on Friday, just a few hundred miles away. Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the event.

It's a moment that's eerily similar to one that occurred more than two decades ago, when the NRA's annual event was set to begin in Denver just days after two gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. A day after that horrific school shooting in 1999, leaders of the NRA gathered to craft their response. Tim Mak of NPR's Investigations team obtained secret recordings of how they debated how to respond and whether to hold their annual meeting. What the NRA decided then would become a standard response the organization would use for decades of school shootings to come.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

Hey, UP FIRST listeners, A Martinez here. We have a special presentation for you today from our Investigations team at NPR's longform audio unit. It follows more than four years of reporting by NPR's Tim Mak. We'll let Tim and the Investigations team tell you more. And a warning - this episode contains discussions of guns and school shootings. Some of the audio may be disturbing to some listeners. Investigations correspondent Tom Dreisbach takes it from here.

TOM DREISBACH, BYLINE: It was April 20, 1999.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Good evening. It's happened again - a mass shooting at an American school, this time a high school in suburban Denver.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: At least two gunmen opened fire today at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. There were many injuries and fatalities.

DREISBACH: Two high schoolers took a rifle, a pistol and shotguns to their school and started firing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: And you could hear, like, bombs and shotguns going off. And then he came into the library and shot everybody around me.

DREISBACH: Twelve students and one of their teachers were killed; more than 20 were injured before the shooters killed themselves. Columbine is just outside of Denver, so it wasn't long before the news crews arrived, and it felt like the whole country was watching.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Investigators say they spent their final moments rigging the building and their own bodies with more than two dozen pipe bombs.

DREISBACH: Columbine was one of the worst school shootings the country had ever seen. And everyone was trying to figure out how to respond. Schools postponed pep rallies and games. TV shows and movies were pulled from the schedules. Concerts were canceled. But there was one event that remained on the schedule and in Denver, not far from where the shooting took place. It was the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WELLINGTON WEBB: It would seem to me that good manners would dictate not to come into a place that's suffering the kind of tragedy and grieving and loss that this community is now suffering.

DREISBACH: Denver's mayor, Wellington Webb, asked the NRA, the most powerful gun rights organization in the country, to cancel. Thousands of the NRA's members were expected in Denver for this annual meeting, which is a kind of combination gun show-Second Amendment rally and policy meeting. It was a meeting set to take place just miles away from Columbine. And so the NRA's leaders had to ask themselves, what do we do?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It's going to be a bad situation...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A nightmare.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: ...No matter what we do. The question is, how do you make a bad situation as least bad as you possibly can?

DREISBACH: This tape is from an internal conference call that took place the day after the shootings, April 21, 1999.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: This is the same concern, obviously, that everybody has, that at the same period where they're going to be burying these children, we're going to be having media within 10 miles of our convention center, the world's media, trying to run through the exhibit hall looking at kids fondling firearms, which is going to be a horrible, horrible, horrible juxtaposition.

DREISBACH: To journalists, the NRA is often a black box, and this tape that you're hearing was never supposed to be made public. For more than 20 years, it wasn't. Then just recently, NPR's Washington Investigative correspondent Tim Mak heard from a source. The source was on that call and taped it. And this black box started to open.

TIM MAK, BYLINE: The NRA is just one of the most powerful and controversial organizations in the country, right? And sometimes because of its centrality to this, the conversation about gun politics or our politics in general, there's a tendency for people to imagine what it must be like behind the scenes or what an organization must be like, whether for good or evil. And here, what we actually have is we actually can put you in the room. We can actually put you on the phone call where these people in real time are struggling to deal with this crisis as it unfolds.

DREISBACH: The decision the NRA would make was about much more than Columbine and the crisis of that particular moment. In the next two decades, school shootings would number in the hundreds and the decision executives made on their public stance in Denver in 1999 would echo again and again when the NRA responds to the next mass shooting and the one after that and the one after that. But how they got there, that was surprising. And it's coming up after this break.

All right, we are back. I'm Tom Dreisbach, and this is UP FIRST from NPR. And our guide to this story is NPR's Washington Investigative correspondent Tim Mak. Tim recently got a hold of these secret tapes from the NRA conference call that took place just one day after the Columbine school shooting in Littleton, Colo. And on this call, top NRA leaders were trying to figure out what to do about this big NRA meeting coming up about 10 days away.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: On the line. We're all here - Mary Corrigan, Craig, Jim Land...

DREISBACH: Who all is on this conference call?

MAK: It's everyone that's important in the NRA.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Angus, Tony, Cain.

MAK: We're talking the executives, the officials of the organization, the senior staffers, lobbyists, outside advisers, PR consultants. And it really underlines just how critical this moment is for the NRA, right? They're in total panic mode, everything just flying at them, and they'd never really dealt with something quite this dramatic before.

DREISBACH: What are the stakes for the NRA? What is their dilemma in this moment?

MAK: So they've got a number of serious problems. Firstly is a financial one, right? This conference, which they do every year, costs millions and millions and millions of dollars to put together. It's their biggest - it's their marquee event. And it's also one of those events where they spend a lot of their time fundraising. A lot of the money they take in every year comes as a result of the person-to-person connections that come as a result of this conference. So money is a big issue. Another issue is it's really one of those kind of pump-it-up kind of conferences where people network. It's where friends get together. It's where gossip is exchanged. It's just the most important thing for this community.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

WAYNE LAPIERRE: The three options are, one, go ahead full speed. Keep the radio going. Keep the billboards going. Do the exhibit hall. Do the meeting as planned. Two would be to cancel the exhibit hall and do the business meetings of the association. And the third option would be to cancel everything.

DREISBACH: So who is that speaking just there?

MAK: So the voice you hear laying out the options is this guy named Wayne LaPierre. He's someone who has been the head of the NRA for decades. But what you hear in this tape and what you get a sense of if you talk to people who've known him over these decades is that he's a really kind of weak-willed leader. He's a deeply anxious person. And what you hear in these tapes is him laying out the options but really not weighing in at all about what to actually do.

DREISBACH: So we have all these top leaders of the NRA, and we have them going through these three options, as Wayne LaPierre laid them out. What do they see as, like, the pros and cons of each approach?

MAK: So one of the options is scaling down their convention. And one of the people who is supporting this view is this guy named Angus McQueen. And if you talk to people who have known Angus McQueen well, they'll describe him in two ways. They'll say he's a genius, but he's also a bit of a jerk. He's the head of this messaging arm of the NRA, this PR firm called Ackerman McQueen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ANGUS MCQUEEN: But is there a way we can have our cake and eat it too? Can we say, out of deference to the sensitivities in Denver, we are going to move our meeting 100 miles away? We are going to cancel the exhibit aspect of the meeting, but we are going to still invite our members in Colorado to meet. Our officers will be there, and we are going to conduct our business. We still then would have tremendous press opportunity to advance our point of view, which is a very strong one. And I want to...

DREISBACH: He's trying to thread this needle between seeming responsible and not being deliberately provocative in a way.

MAK: That's right. And this is really what the tape is about - is that if they're too deferential, it'll be like they're culpable for these shootings. It'll be as if they were acknowledging defeat and adopting the media's narrative that they're responsible for the shootings at Columbine.

DREISBACH: All right, so that's one of the possible paths, this sort of middle ground. What's the pro and con of just canceling the whole thing because of what just happened in Columbine? Is there anyone who says, let's just cancel it all?

MAK: Well, I think that there's real resistance from the NRA to cancel at all with the money spent on this, with all the travel plans.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Would it be smart to use language like rescheduled and postponed instead of canceled?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: What do you mean?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: It implies an expectation to continue on with our business as usual but just at a more - a less sensitive time. There is an emotional difference between postponing and canceling.

MAK: One big con is that if they cancel it, they won't have an opportunity to respond to the criticisms that are going to come their way.

DREISBACH: It's like they're ceding the ground to all the people who would criticize the NRA. They won't be able to respond as quickly.

MAK: Yeah. Let's not forget that there's some pride involved here - right? - that if they were to cancel, it would seem to them and their members and the media and everyone else as if they were accepting defeat in this arena. And so there's a lot of resistance to that idea. Listen here to Jim Land. He's a top official of the NRA at this time.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JIM LAND: I got to tell you, we got to think this thing through because if we tuck tail and run, we're going to be accepting responsibility for what happened out there.

TONY MAKRIS: That's one very good argument, Jim. On the other side, if you don't appear to be deferential and honoring the dead, you end up being a tremendous shithead who wouldn't tuck tail and run, you know? So it's a double-edged sword.

MAK: That guy right there talking to Jim Land - that's Tony Makris. He's a strategic adviser for the NRA and has been working with the NRA for many, many years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MAKRIS: I don't know what - I don't have - I don't know what the answer is. But I know this. It's far worse to go out there and be painted as a bunch of insensitive, disrespectful turds than it is to say, we're sorry it happened, and we'll bow out.

DREISBACH: It's so remarkable to hear them talk about how they come across. I guess I'm used to the NRA being very - just being very confidently not caring about how they come across to people who might be their political opponents - right? - that they're not so worried these days about seeming maybe a little insensitive. And yet here on this call, they're really worried about seeming insensitive.

MAK: I think it's a testament to how powerful the NRA has become in the modern era that - like, 20 years ago, you know, there's a lot less security for the NRA. It's not as powerful as it has become today. It hasn't grown to the size that it's become today. It doesn't have as much money as it has today. And so it survives based on how the public perceives them at this point. And this is an NRA that no longer exists.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MAK: There are a couple other voices that are important on the call. This guy named Kayne Robinson, he's an official in the organization, longtime NRA secretary.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KAYNE ROBINSON: How do we look - this is Kayne - if we - is there something concrete that we can offer, not because guns are responsible, but because we care about these people? Is there anything? Does that look crass or, you know, if we...

JIM BAKER: You mean the legislative?

ROBINSON: No, I'm talking about something concrete. If we...

MAKRIS: Like a victim's fund or...

ROBINSON: Yeah, we create a victim's fund, and we give the victims a million dollars or something like that. Does that look bad, or does it look...

MAKRIS: Well, I mean, that can be twisted too. I mean, why are you giving money? You feel responsible?

ROBINSON: No. Well, you're - true. It can be twisted, but we feel sympathetic and...

BILL POWERS: Respectful. Yeah.

DREISBACH: I mean, it's so interesting to hear them talking about, you know, raising money for the families of these victims and the people who were injured. And yet they see a pretty big downside to giving those families money.

MAK: I think here's why these - particular slice of tape was so important. It's because you hear the NRA in real time considering a softer tone. You hear them talking about a million-dollar victim fund or even apologizing, saying we're sorry, in the wake of a mass shooting. They talk about sympathy and respect in terms of PR terms, right? How's the public going to view the NRA as sympathetic and respectful, not, how can we be sympathetic and respectful?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARION HAMMER: I think what you ought to do is you move forward with your meeting, everything that you had planned to do, but you issue a statement of sympathy and start talking about the fact that this country needs to stop blaming everybody but the perpetrators and that you cannot...

MAK: So the person you're hearing there is this woman named Marion Hammer. She was the first female president of the NRA, and she's a fierce lobbyist who has been working in NRA circles for many, many years. People describe her as kind of like this tiny but fierce figure. Anyone who's anyone in the NRA fears her because she's so assertive and dominant and powerful in the organization.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMMER: ...That the warning signs have been there. Why have they been unable to deal effectively and to protect our students? But, you know, those are, like, sound bites. But you issue an expression of sympathy, but you have to go forward. For NRA to scrap this and the amount of money that we have spent...

LAPIERRE: We have meeting insurance.

HAMMER: I just - screw the insurance. The message that it will send is that even the NRA was brought to its knees, and the media will have a field day with it.

LAPIERRE: All right. Let me ask you this.

MAK: And, you know, what you hear also from Marion Hammer is this kind of pride element of it again, which is, we can't let the public think that they brought us to our knees. We can't let the public think that the NRA had a negative day or a negative week or a negative month as a result of this tragedy. And this is kind of the framing for the whole conversation.

DREISBACH: Right.

MAK: And you also hear her talk about how guns aren't responsible, that it's society that's responsible. It's warning signs in the community that have nothing to do with them.

DREISBACH: I mean, I remember I was just about to turn 12 years old when Columbine happened. And I remember a lot of the discussions were about, you know, was this related to the movie "The Matrix" coming out, where there were, you know, a lot of shootings in that, or the music of Marilyn Manson or video games? And a lot of that was in the discussion maybe even more than guns back then.

MAK: That's right. The NRA was really behind a lot of these questions. Whether it was violent video games, movies, violent music, whether the government was just not competently enforcing existing laws about guns, they were trying to change the conversation from firearms to culture. Here's NRA lobbyist Randy Scheunemann.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

RANDY SCHEUNEMANN: But at the same time, in terms of what (inaudible) going to say, it seems to me that they're going to be resentful over the fact that, to state the obvious, they have nothing to do with Satan-worshipping neo-Nazi Hollywood-driven, punk rock-driven murder and mayhem.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DREISBACH: After the break, how the NRA mobilized their allies, plus what they really think about their members. That's next.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DREISBACH: All right, we are back. I'm Tom Dreisbach, and this is a special presentation of UP FIRST Sunday from NPR Investigations. So we've heard all this about, you know, PR and the media coverage that they're worried about and how to, you know, change potentially the conference to make the media coverage seem better. Did they talk at all about gun laws and politics at this stage?

MAK: They talk about gun politics, but it's almost like it's a done deal, like it's baked into the cake how people are going to respond. What they're basically doing is they're putting together a coalition to respond. And you hear Wayne LaPierre kind of hint at how they're going to put this coalition together.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: Well, I was talking to Nickles' office this morning, and what they told me is they're sending them - they're planning on sending them all to school 'cause what they wanted us to do was secretly provide them with talking points.

DREISBACH: He mentioned secretly providing people with talking points. Who's he talking about there?

MAK: Well, Nickles is Don Nickles. He's a member of the Republican Senate leadership and, at the time, is the Senate majority whip.

DREISBACH: Oh.

MAK: And so what we're hearing is Wayne LaPierre saying, OK, well, Senate Republicans are asking us for secret talking points. They're asking us to lead the messaging on this because they're going to go to schools and have conversations with people in their communities, these senators are, and they don't really know what to say. We need to tell them. It's a frantic time for the NRA. And you can see that they're at the nexus of this entire conversation.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAKER: I, you know - this is Jim Baker here. I mean, we've been through the various options. And based on everything I've heard, I - at this point, I think the best option, barring any other input from the governor or any other credible authority out there, is to cancel the exhibit hall, recast our meeting as one of respect and sympathy. But at the same time, we're going to have to deal with the media and make the very points that Marion's making, that this is not only not our fault, but we're goddamn sick and tired of being blamed for it. And here's why. I mean...

MAK: So Jim Baker there, when he's talking about canceling the exhibit hall, that's the gun expo where you have all these weapons and accessories and people are milling about in this giant convention hall. And then separately, there's what's called the members' meeting, and this is something that the NRA has to have every year, according to its rules.

DREISBACH: Oh.

MAK: Just think of, like, the political conventions where they nominate presidential candidates, and there are all these people milling on the floor and proposing resolutions and seconding each other and arguing the pros and cons of each. And Wayne LaPierre is worried about this meeting getting out of control after Columbine and embarrassing the NRA.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: You know, the other problem is the people you are most likely to get in that member meeting without an exhibit hall are the nuts.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: That's right.

MAKRIS: That's - I made that point earlier. I agree.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: But you've got to have...

MAKRIS: The fruitcakes are going to show up.

DREISBACH: Whoa. OK. So that was Tony Makris calling, you know, the NRA members fruitcakes.

MAK: It's some really astonishing tape - right? - because we're getting into the minds now of these senior NRA officials, and they're disparaging their own members, right? They acknowledge that there are these people who they consider to be kind of crazy...

DREISBACH: Yeah.

MAK: ...That make up the core of their organization, their most passionate members who would show up to members' meetings, and they're worried about how their own members might embarrass them. And that's not all.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMMER: If you pull down the exhibit hall, that's not going to leave anything for the media except the members' meeting. And you're going to have the wackos with all kinds of crazy resolutions, with all kinds of dressing like a bunch of hillbillies and idiots. And it's going to be the worst thing you can imagine.

DREISBACH: Wow. OK, so that's Marion Hammer calling some of their own members wackos, hillbillies, idiots. I mean, it sounds like they're really almost embarrassed by some of their own members.

MAK: Yeah. They're using all this disparaging language. But, like, I think the most instructive part of that tape is when you hear this chuckle in the background. It's like this knowing chuckle among their group, like an inside joke almost. Like, they get it. They all understand.

DREISBACH: So you think it's, like, not the first time they've said this?

MAK: Yeah. And this is not just Marion Hammer. This is Wayne LaPierre, the head of the organization, and Tony Makris. And, you know, this is just some of the tape that we're playing for you. I mean, there's always been this divide between NRA officials and their most right-wing members - right? - that there are the people who are trying to run the organization, trying to mainstream their view of gun politics. And then there are these members who are more ideological and more aggressive about what the Second Amendment should mean for America. And what you're hearing is they're worried that these people will show up after a mass shooting and embarrass the organization.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DREISBACH: After the break, what the NRA ultimately decides to do about this meeting and how that changed gun politics in America.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DREISBACH: All right, we are back. I'm Tom Dreisbach, and this is a special presentation of UP FIRST Sunday from NPR investigations. And we've been talking about the different camps within the NRA and this internal debate over what the organization should do about its big upcoming meeting after the Columbine shooting. That meeting was supposed to take place in Denver, Colo., not far from the shooting. And some in the NRA said they should delay the meeting. Some said move it somewhere else. Some said create a victims' fund. Another said don't back down. Don't change anything. So, Tim, what did they ultimately decide?

MAK: What they really do is they land on a middle ground - that they're going to cancel the festivities and the exhibit hall. But they are going to still plan for the meeting itself.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAKER: I think we're all kind of reaching consensus here. Nobody likes the situation, but I think what we have is a kind of architecture here for trying to make the best of it. And that's what we just have to work like hell for is if...

LAPIERRE: (Unintelligible) is to live another day at this point.

BAKER: You bet.

MAK: And what they're really relying here is on the strength of their message and the people who will deliver it. And that's Wayne LaPierre, of course, and the NRA president at the time, Charlton Heston.

DREISBACH: And for people who don't know, Charlton Heston was, you know, a longtime Hollywood actor. He was in "Planet Of The Apes," the version from the '60s. And then he went on to become, you know, the public face of the NRA in the late '90s and early 2000s.

MAK: That's right - all, based on the strength of his kind of booming, godlike voice.

DREISBACH: (Laughter) Literally. Wasn't he Moses?

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "THE TEN COMMANDMENTS")

CHARLTON HESTON: (As Moses) How can I lead this people out of bondage? What words can I speak that they will heed.

MAK: So yeah, he plays Moses in "The Ten Commandments" - right? So that gives you a sense of the sort of almost moral authority he drew from his acting career.

DREISBACH: Is he on this call at all? Is he talked about?

MAK: Well, OK. So while Charlton Heston is the public face of this organization, they don't really trust him to make the message. They trust him to convey the message. They don't really trust him to deliberate on or strategize what the NRA's position should be.

DREISBACH: Huh. So they don't actually think he's the greatest mind in deciding the message of gun policy or gun rights in America.

MAK: They don't see Charlton Heston as a strategist. They see him as a kind of spokesperson, almost. He's an actor, after all.

DREISBACH: Yeah.

MAK: There you go. Read the lines.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAKER: Talk shows are not the perfect forum.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: I know. And I'm just saying...

BAKER: Heston doesn't do talk shows real well.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9: You need a venue where he can talk but they can't ask him questions.

BAKER: You got it.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #9: Yeah.

BAKER: I want to hear...

DREISBACH: So when the annual meeting actually happens, what kind of role did Charlton Heston end up playing?

MAK: We hear him at this sort of slimmed-down convention that the NRA holds.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HESTON: Good morning.

UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Good morning.

MAK: And we can hear them executing what we heard them strategizing about on this call, and in Heston's words, as the spokesperson of the NRA.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HESTON: So we have the same rights as all other citizens to be here - to help shoulder the grief, to share our sorrow and to offer our respectful, reassured voice to the national discourse that has erupted around this tragedy.

DREISBACH: Yeah, it's interesting hearing a lot of that message now coming through this incredible, you know, booming voice of Charlton Heston.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HESTON: Our words and our behavior will be scrutinized more than ever this morning. Those who are hostile towards us will lie in wait to seize on a soundbite out of context, ever searching for an embarrassing moment to ridicule us. So let us be mindful - the eyes of the nation are upon us today.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DREISBACH: It's almost like Charlton Heston, it sounds like, is trying to talk to them, to say be careful. Because of Columbine, the cameras are really on us. You know, think about what you say before you say it. Is that him trying to kind of rein those folks in, at least, on behalf of the leadership?

MAK: That really seems to be what's happening here - right? - that you hear them translating what they were strategizing about into a warning for some of their own members who behind the scenes they expressed a lot of concern would embarrass them. So they really had to be mindful about the message that they were sending at this conference because it was an event that was highly covered by national press. And meanwhile, outside of the convention, there are thousands of people showing up to demonstrate against them.

DREISBACH: Yeah, what was the scene outside?

MAK: So there were huge protests outside. The Washington Post estimated 8,000 demonstrators, including many of them who are gathered just right outside the hotel where Charlton Heston is giving that speech that we heard. And one of those people was this person named Tom Mauser. He's one of the parents of Daniel Mauser, who was killed in that shooting.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TOM MAUSER: There are reasonable gun owners, many. But the time has come to come to understand that a TEC-9 semi-automatic 30-bullet weapon like that that killed my son is not used to kill deer.

(APPLAUSE)

MAUSER: It has no useful purpose.

You know, for the first 10 days after Columbine, I rarely at all spoke to the media. I was pretty much hunkered down in my home.

MAK: Tom Mauser is now a spokesperson for a group called Colorado Ceasefire. He's become a pretty prominent gun control activist in the years since.

DREISBACH: What else did he have to say about, you know, these tapes where he actually heard what the other side was saying on the inside?

MAK: Yeah, he listened to some of these NRA tapes, and some of it didn't surprise him, but some of it really did stand out.

MAUSER: The bluntness of it did surprise me, that they would actually say, well, maybe we should have a victims fund. Oh, no, we can't do that. That would make us look like we're somehow responsible. It just showed that this was all a matter of political calculation for them, that that - it especially struck me the nerve that they would then make comments about how now is not the time to be talking about politics. You know, now is the time for reflection and grief. And yet here they were talking about politics, exactly what they were doing.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MAK: You know, I actually asked him how he would have reacted if the NRA had set up a victims fund.

MAUSER: (Laughter) That's a good question. I don't think that we would have accepted anything from them. I would have seen it as them trying to appease the victims and to try to make themselves look good despite the terrible situation they were in.

DREISBACH: It's hard to imagine, you know, the alternate history in which the NRA takes a different tack in that moment and does set up a victims fund and maybe says even they're sorry. But - it's hard to even imagine that world because they really took almost the opposite response. And I'm curious, you know, now that you and NPR obtained these tapes and we've published excerpts from these tapes, what has the NRA said about all of this?

MAK: So after NPR obtained these tapes, we reached out to the people who were on them for comment. And, of course, we also reached out to the NRA before publication. What we did was we gave them transcripts of the clips that we were thinking about using, and the NRA responded. They called it a, quote-unquote, "hit piece" that was coming. The NRA also said that we were invoking Columbine to promote an editorial agenda against them. And what's so interesting about this is that in responding this way, they're using the same playbook that they created and was shown in these tapes from over 20 years ago. They're trying to change the topic from the core issues in these tapes.

DREISBACH: So, you know, the other group of people who are mentioned on these tapes but we don't hear from are the actual NRA members, you know, who are sometimes talked about as, quote-unquote, "fruitcakes," "hillbillies," et cetera. Did you hear from any current NRA members about what they heard on these tapes?

MAK: Yeah. So as part of my reporting, I talk quite frequently with NRA members, and I asked some of them, what did these tapes show? Because a lot of them are the sorts of people described disparagingly by NRA officials as fruitcakes and idiots and nuts and so on. These are people who are, you know, making speeches at NRA meetings and proposing resolutions. Here's what they had to say.

FRANK TAIT: I was insulted when I heard those because, you know, I'm one of those yahoos that put resolutions in front of the board. And the only time we have a chance to have a say in what goes on in the organization is that the resolutions at the members meeting.

ROB PINCUS: The people that are - that, you know, may be bought into the idea that this was some kind of left-wing attack on the NRA that was unfounded, fake news, whatever, for them to hear that coming out of Marion Hammer's mouth, coming out of Wayne LaPierre's mouth, for them to hear the opinions and the disregard, distrust for the people that are most motivated to be at the member's meetings - I mean, I've been to, you know, full board meetings where any member - 5 million claimed members of the NRA can attend - I was the only one. So does that make me a wacko? But it's interesting to see that what they fear from the membership and what the membership really represents, particularly the members that will go to the members meeting.

RON CARTER: So going back in time and listening to those tapes, it's like watching on repeat episodes of "The Office" where you know, the character Michael Scott is always making a blunder and everyone in the office is just completely dysfunctional. But instead of some sort of comic relief, there is none. It's merely just a cringe-worthy trainwreck that continues and continues and continues.

MAK: Those three were Frank Tait, Rob Pincus and Ron Carter. And they're part of a movement inside the NRA that's trying to reform the organization. They're seeking new leadership at the top and more transparency in the nonprofit. I mean, the NRA is in a lot of trouble right now.

DREISBACH: And, I mean, it sounds like they have not felt that the NRA really listens to their members, their grassroots members. You know, the NRA always talks about their millions of members that are the backbone of the organization will give them their strength. Those people were pretty upset by what they heard on these tapes.

MAK: And maybe in better times, that would be something that's more excusable. But there are a lot of members who are pretty pissed off right now because the NRA is under the most serious mortal threat it's seen in over 150 years of existence.

DREISBACH: Right. Could you just give a sense of where the NRA stands right now?

MAK: The NRA is really in shambles financially. In 2018, they almost couldn't make payroll. That's a serious problem for any organization to be in. The New York attorney general launched an investigation and, after 18 months, accused the NRA and Wayne LaPierre and three others of contributing to the loss of more than $64 million in just three years.

DREISBACH: Wow.

MAK: This is something that the New York attorney general called fraud and abuse. And what she was seeking was to dissolve the NRA entirely. Now, the NRA was originally founded in New York, so the New York AG has jurisdiction over the organization. The NRA has said that her action, her office's action is part of a politically motivated attack and that they've become a more accountable organization in the time since.

DREISBACH: So when we look back now at these tapes that you just obtained and can hear these executives, some of them who are still with the NRA, talk about the strategy, I mean, what do those tapes tell us about the NRA and gun politics and how those have evolved over the last two decades?

MAK: You know, the tapes really show the NRA's policies and its playbook being developed in real time. Just take a listen to what Heston said back in 1999 to close out the convention this is all about.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HESTON: The dirty secret of this day and age is that political gain and media ratings all too often bloom on fresh graves.

MAK: That line, which was originally strategized on these NRA tapes, is something they use over and over again in the years to come. But they say it in slightly different ways. Take a listen to Wayne LaPierre talking after the shootings at Sandy Hook in 2012.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: Out of respect for the families and until the facts are known, the NRA has refrained from comment. While some have tried to exploit tragedy for political gain, we have remained respectively silent.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MAK: This theme that you can't talk about firearms policy after mass shootings continues throughout the years. Here's Wayne LaPierre after the shootings in Parkland in 2018.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LAPIERRE: As usual, the opportunist wasted not one second to exploit tragedy for political gain - the breakback speed of calls for more gun control laws and the breathless national media eager to smear the NRA.

MAK: You know, Tom, just in the last few weeks, there have been several school shootings. And the NRA's response was to tweet quote, "The criminal is the problem, not the inanimate object. This is really not hard to comprehend."

DREISBACH: So what do you think these tapes tell us about the NRA and gun politics over these last two decades?

MAK: You look at the events after these tapes, the mass shootings that followed after Columbine. You had Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook and Parkland and all sorts of other mass shootings that have occurred over the last 20 years. And then you look at what's actually occurred in terms of legislation responding to them.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MAK: At the federal level at least, there's been no significant gun control legislation passed since these tapes. And in the meantime, they've been able to advance gun rights legislation.

DREISBACH: And that's true even though the NRA is in such a weak position now.

MAK: Yeah. What the NRA does so successfully is that they're able to mobilize its grassroots members. Politicians aren't really scared as much about the NRA's money. They're worried about getting yelled at at town halls and having their phone lines lit up and their email boxes flooded. And the people the NRA is most able to mobilize are these wackos, these so-called fruitcakes, these hillbillies.

DREISBACH: So even though the NRA leadership was complaining about, you know, what they viewed as the, quote, unquote, "fruitcakes, the wackos," those members who they denigrated in this way are really the source of strength for the NRA and the gun rights movement.

MAK: Yeah. And the decisions, the strategy that they developed after Columbine on these secret tapes, they worked to help the NRA defend themselves in the wake of these mass shootings again and again and again.

DREISBACH: Tim, thanks so much.

MAK: Thanks a lot.

This is Planet Money from NPR.
Hi, Planet Money listeners.
Amanda Aronchik here.
We had a very different plan for today's show, but after yesterday's shooting at an elementary
school in Texas, we decided to share this story.
A warning, this episode deals with guns and school shootings.
The NRA's annual meeting begins on Friday in Houston, just a few hundred miles from
Uvalde, Texas.
Former President Donald Trump is slated to headline the event.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott is also expected to speak.
It's a moment that's eerily similar to one that occurred more than two decades ago,
when the NRA's annual event was set to begin in Denver, just days after two gunmen
killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado.
NPR's investigations team recently published a story showing how the NRA's response
in that moment, back in 1999, set the organization's strategy with regard to school
shootings.
Reporter Tim Mack obtained secret recordings of top NRA leaders at that time.
In those recordings, they debate possible courses of action.
And where they landed then feels something like the NRA's playbook today.
Tim Mack led the reporting with Tom Dreisbach of the investigations team.
Columbine was one of the worst school shootings the country had ever seen.
And everyone was trying to figure out how to respond.
Posts postponed pep rallies and games, TV shows and movies were pulled from the schedules,
concerts were canceled.
But there was one event that remained on the schedule, and in Denver, not far from
where the shooting took place.
It was the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association.
It would seem to me that good manners would dictate not to come into a place
that's suffering the kind of tragedy and grieving and loss that this community
is now suffering.
Denver's mayor, Wellington Webb, asked the NRA, the most powerful gun rights organization
in the country, to cancel.
Thousands of the NRA's members were expected in Denver for this annual meeting, which
is a kind of combination gun show, Second Amendment rally, and policy meeting.
It was a meeting set to take place just miles away from Columbine.
And so the NRA's leaders had to ask themselves, what do we do?
This tape is from an internal conference call that took place the day after the shootings,
April 21, 1999.
To journalists, the NRA is often a black box.
And this tape that you're hearing was never supposed to be made public.
For more than 20 years, it wasn't.
Then just recently, NPR's Washington investigative correspondent, Tim Mack, heard from a source.
The source was on that call and taped it.
And this black box started to open.
The NRA is just one of the most powerful and controversial organizations in the country.
And sometimes because of its centrality to the conversation about gun politics, or our
politics in general, there's a tendency for people to imagine what it must be like
behind the scenes, or what an organization must be like, whether for good or evil.
And here what we actually have is we actually can put you in the room.
We can actually put you on the phone call, where these people in real time are struggling
to deal with this crisis as it unfolds.
The decision the NRA would make was about much more than Columbine and the crisis of
that particular moment.
In the next two decades, school shootings would number in the hundreds, and the decision
executives made on their public stance in Denver in 1999 would echo again and again
when the NRA responded to the next mass shooting, and the one after that, and
the one after that.
But how they got there?
That was surprising.
And it's coming up after this break.
All right, we are back.
I'm Tom Dreisbach, and our guide to this story is NPR's Washington investigative
correspondent, Tim Mack.
Tim recently got a hold of these secret tapes from the NRA conference call that took place
just one day after the Columbine school shooting in Littleton, Colorado.
And on this call, top NRA leaders were trying to figure out what to do about this
big NRA meeting coming up about 10 days away.
Who all is on this conference call?
It's everyone that's important in the NRA.
We're talking the executives, the officials of the organization, senior staffers, lobbyists,
outside advisors, PR consultants.
And it really underlines just how critical this moment is for the NRA, right?
They're in total panic mode.
Everything just flying at them, and they've never really dealt with something quite
this dramatic before.
What are the stakes for the NRA?
What is their dilemma in this moment?
So they've got a number of serious problems.
Firstly is a financial one, right?
This conference, which they do every year, costs millions and millions and millions
of dollars to put together.
It's their biggest, it's their marquee event.
And it's also one of those events where they spend a lot of their time fundraising.
A lot of the money they take in every year comes as a result of the person to
person connections that come as a result of this conference.
So money is a big issue.
Another issue is it's really one of those kind of pump it up kind of conferences
where people network, it's where friends get together, it's where gossip is exchanged.
It's just the most important thing for this community.
The three options are one, go ahead full speed, keep the radio going,
keep the billboards going, do the exhibit hall, do the board address,
do the meeting as planned.
Two would be to cancel the exhibit hall.
So who is that speaking just there?
So the voice you hear laying out the options is this guy named Wayne LaPierre.
He's someone who has been the head of the NRA for decades.
But what you hear in this tape and what you get a sense of if you talk to people
who've known him over these decades is that he's a really kind of weak-willed leader.
He's a deeply anxious person.
And what you hear in these tapes is him laying out the options, but
really not weighing in at all about what to actually do.
So we have all these top leaders of the NRA, and
we have them going through these three options as Wayne LaPierre laid them out.
What do they see as the pros and cons of each approach?
So one of the options is scaling down their convention.
And one of the people who is supporting this view is this guy named
Angus McQueen.
And if you talk to people who have known Angus McQueen well,
they'll describe him in two ways.
They'll say he's a genius, but he's also a bit of a jerk.
He's the head of this messaging arm of the NRA,
this PR firm called Ackerman McQueen.
But is there a way we can have our cake and eat it too?
Can we say 100 miles away, we're gonna cancel the exhibit aspect of
the meeting, but we are gonna still invite our members in Colorado to meet?
Our officers will be there to conduct our business.
We still then would have tremendous press opportunity to advance our
point of view, which is a very strong one.
He's trying to thread this needle between seeming responsible and
not being deliberately provocative in a way.
That's right.
And this is really what the tape is about,
is that if they're too differential,
it'll be like they're culpable for these shootings.
It'll be as if they were acknowledging defeat and
adopting the media's narrative that they're responsible for
the shootings at Columbine.
So that's one of the possible paths, the sort of middle ground.
What's the pro and con of just canceling the whole thing
because of what just happened at Columbine?
Is there anyone who says, let's just cancel it all?
Well, I think that there's real resistance from the NRA to cancel it
all with the money spent on this, with all the travel plans.
Would it be smart to use a language like rescheduled and
postponed instead of canceled?
What do you mean?
It implies an expectation to continue on with our business as usual,
but just at a more, a less sensitive time.
There is an emotional difference between postponing and canceling.
One big con is that if they cancel it,
they won't have an opportunity to respond to the criticisms that are
going to come their way.
It's like they're seeding the ground to all the people who
would criticize the NRA, they won't be able to respond as quickly.
Let's not forget that there's some pride involved here, right?
That if they were to cancel, it would seem to them and their members and
the media and everyone else as if they were accepting defeat in this arena.
And so there's a lot of resistance to that idea.
Listen here to Jim Land.
He's a top official of the NRA at this time.
I got to tell you, we got to think this thing through because if we
can responsibility for what happened out there.
That's one very good argument, Jim, on the other side.
If you don't appear to be deferential in honoring the dead,
you end up being a tremendous shithead who wouldn't tuck tail and run.
So it's a double edged sword.
That guy right there talking to Jim Land, that's Tony Makris.
He's a strategic advisor for the NRA and
has been working with the NRA for many, many years.
I don't know what the answer is.
But I know this, it's far worse to go out there and
be painted as a bunch of insensitive, disrespectful turds.
Than it is to say, we're sorry it happened and we'll bow out.
It's so remarkable to hear them talk about how they come across.
I guess I'm used to the NRA just being very confidently
not caring about how they come across to people who might be their
political opponents, right?
That they're not so worried these days about
seeming maybe a little insensitive.
And yet here on this call,
they're really worried about seeming insensitive.
I think it's a testament to how powerful the NRA has become in
the modern era that like 20 years ago,
there's a lot less security for the NRA.
It's not as powerful as it has become today.
It hasn't grown to the size that it's become today.
It doesn't have as much money as it has today.
And so it survives based on how the public perceives them at this point.
And this is an NRA that no longer exists.
There are a couple other voices that are important on the call.
This guy named Cain Robinson,
he's an official in the organization, longtime NRA secretary.
How do we look, is there something concrete that we can offer?
Not because guns are responsible, but because, is there anything?
Does that look crass, or are we talking about something concrete?
It's like a victim's fund.
We create a victim's fund, and we give the victim a million dollars.
I mean, that can be twisted too.
I mean, why are you giving money?
You feel responsible?
Well, you're true.
It can be twisted, but we feel sympathetic and
respectful.
Yeah.
I mean, it's so interesting to hear them talking about raising money for
the families of these victims and the people who were injured.
And yet they see a pretty big downside to giving those families money.
I think here's why these particular slice of tape was so important.
It's because you hear the NRA in real time, considering a softer tone.
You hear them talking about a million dollars victim fund, or
even apologizing, saying we're sorry in the wake of a mass shooting.
They talk about sympathy and respect in terms of PR terms, right?
How's the public gonna view the NRA as sympathetic and respectful?
Not how can we be sympathetic and respectful?
I think what you ought to do is you move forward with your meeting,
everything that you had planned to do, but you issue a statement
of sympathy and start talking about the fact that this country
needs to stop blaming everybody but the perpetrators.
So the person you're hearing there is this woman named Marianne Hammer.
She was the first female president of the NRA, and
she's a fierce lobbyist who has been working in NRA circles for many,
many years.
We'll describe her as this tiny but fierce figure.
Anyone who's anyone in the NRA fears her because she's so assertive and
dominant and powerful in the organization.
That the warning signs have been there.
Why have they been unable to deal effectively and
to protect our students?
But those are like soundbites, but
you issue an expression of sympathy.
But you have to go forward to scrap this and
the amount of money that we have spent.
We have meeting insurance.
I just screw the insurance.
The message that it will send is that even the NRA was brought to its knees.
And the media will have a field day with it.
All right, let me answer this.
And what you hear also from Marianne Hammer is this kind of pride element of
it, which is we can't let the public think that they brought us to our knees.
We can't let the public think that the NRA had a negative day or
a negative week or a negative month as a result of this tragedy.
And this is kind of the framing for the whole conversation.
Right.
You also hear her talk about how guns aren't responsible.
That it's society that's responsible.
It's warning signs in the community that have nothing to do with them.
I mean, I remember I was just about to turn 12 years old when Columbine happened.
And I remember a lot of the discussions were about was this related to the movie
The Matrix coming out, where there were a lot of shootings and that.
Or the music of Marilyn Manson or video games.
And a lot of that was in the discussion, maybe even more than guns
back then.
That's right.
The NRA was really behind a lot of these questions.
Whether it was violent video games, movies, violent music.
Whether the government was just not competently enforcing existing laws
about guns.
They were trying to change the conversation from firearms to culture.
Here's NRA lobbyist, Randy Shuneman.
But at the same time, in terms of what membership's gonna say,
it seems to me that they're gonna be resentful over the fact that
to state the obvious, they have nothing to do with Satan worshipping neo-Nazi,
Hollywood-driven, punk rock-driven murder and mayhem.
So we've heard all this about PR and the media coverage that they're
worried about and how to change potentially the conference to make the
media coverage seem better.
Do they talk at all about gun laws and politics at this stage?
They talk about gun politics, but it's almost like it's a done deal.
Like it's baked into the cake how people are gonna respond.
What they're basically doing is they're putting together a coalition to
respond.
And you hear Wayne up here kind of hint at how they're gonna put this
coalition together.
Well, I was talking to Nicholson's office this morning.
And what they told me is they're planning on sending them all to
school because what they wanted us to do was secretly provide them with
talking points.
We mentioned secretly providing people with talking points.
Who's he talking about there?
Well, Nichols is Don Nichols.
He's a member of the Republican Senate leadership and at the time is
the Senate majority whip.
And so what we're hearing is Wayne up here saying, OK, well,
Senate Republicans are asking us for secret talking points.
They're asking us to lead the messaging on this because they're going to go to
schools and have conversations with people in their communities,
these senators are, and they don't really know what to say.
We need to tell them.
It's a frantic time for the NRA.
And you can see that they're at the nexus of this entire conversation.
You know, Juke Baker here.
I mean, we've been through the various options and based on everything
I've heard, at this point, I think the best option,
barring any other input from the governor or any other credible
authority out there is to cancel the exhibit hall,
recast our meeting as one of respect and sympathy.
But at the same time, we're going to have to deal with the media and make
the very points that Marion's making that this is not only not our fault,
but we're goddamn sick and tired of being blamed for it.
And here's why.
So Jim Baker there, when he's talking about canceling the exhibit hall,
that's the gun expo where you have all these weapons and accessories and
people are milling about in this giant convention hall.
And then separately, there's what's called the members meeting.
And this is something that the NRA has to have every year
according to its rules.
Just think of like the political conventions where they nominate
presidential candidates.
And there are all these people milling on the floor and proposing
resolutions and seconding each other and arguing the pros and cons of each.
And Wayne LaPierre is worried about this meeting getting out of control
after Columbine and embarrassing the NRA.
You know, the other problem is the people you are most likely to get in
that member meeting without an exhibit hall are the nuts.
That made that point earlier.
I agree.
Whoa.
Okay.
So that was Tony Macris calling, you know, the NRA members fruit cakes?
It's some really astonishing tape, right?
Because we're getting into the minds now of these senior NRA officials and
they're disparaging their own members, right?
They acknowledge that there are these people who they consider to be kind of crazy.
If you pull down the exhibit hall, that's not going to leave anything for
the media except the members meeting.
And you're going to have the wackos with all kinds of crazy resolutions,
with all kinds of dressing like a bunch of hillbillies and idiots.
And it's going to be the worst thing you can imagine.
Wow.
Okay.
So that's Mary and him are calling some of their own members, wackos, hillbillies, idiots.
I mean, it sounds like they're really almost embarrassed by some of their own members.
I mean, there's always been this divide between NRA officials and
their most right-wing members, right?
That there are the people who are trying to run the organization,
try to mainstream their view of gun politics.
And then there are these members who are more ideological and more aggressive
about what the Second Amendment should mean for America.
And what you're hearing is they're worried that these people will show up
after a mass shooting and embarrass the organization.
After the break, what the NRA ultimately decides to do about this meeting
and how that changed gun politics in America.
All right, we are back.
I'm Tom Dreisbach.
We've been talking about the different camps within the NRA
and this internal debate over what the organization should do
about its big upcoming meeting after the Columbine shooting.
That meeting was supposed to take place in Denver, Colorado,
not far from the shooting.
And some of the NRA said they should delay the meeting.
Some said move it somewhere else.
Some said create a victim's fund.
And others said don't back down.
Don't change anything.
So, Tim, what did they ultimately decide?
What they really do is they land on a middle ground,
that they're going to cancel the festivities and the exhibit hall,
but they are going to still plan for the meeting itself.
I think we're all kind of reaching consensus here.
I mean, nobody likes the situation,
but I think what we have is a kind of architecture here
for trying to make the best of it.
And that's what we just have to work like hell for.
The energy is to live another day at this point.
You bet.
And what they're really relying here is on the strength of their message
and the people who will deliver it.
And that's Wayne LaPierre, of course,
and the NRA president at the time, Charlton Heston.
And for people who don't know,
Charlton Heston was a longtime Hollywood actor.
He was in Planet of the Apes, the version from the 60s.
And then he went on to become the public face of the NRA
in the late 90s and early 2000s.
That's right.
All based on the strength of his kind of booming godlike voice.
Literally, wasn't he Moses?
How can I lead this people out of bondage?
What words can I speak that they will heed?
So yeah, he plays Moses in The Ten Commandments, right?
So that gives you a sense of the sort of almost moral authority
he drew from his acting career.
So we have the same right as all other citizens to be here,
to help shoulder the grief, to share our sorrow,
and to offer our respectful, reassured voice
to the national discourse that has erupted around this tragedy.
Yeah, it's interesting hearing a lot of that message
now coming through this incredible, you know,
booming voice of Charlton Heston.
Our words and our behavior will be scrutinized
more than ever this morning.
Those who are hostile towards us will lie and wait
to seize on a sound bite out of context,
ever searching for an embarrassing moment to ridicule us.
So let us be mindful.
The eyes of the nation are upon us today.
It's almost like Charlton Heston, it sounds like,
is trying to talk to them to say,
be careful, because of Columbine,
the cameras are really on us, you know,
think about what you say before you say it.
Is that him trying to kind of rein those folks in,
at least on behalf of the leadership?
That really seems to be what's happening here, right?
That you hear them translating what they were strategizing about
into a warning for some of their own members
who, behind the scenes, they expressed a lot of concern,
would embarrass them.
So they really had to be mindful about the message
that they were sending at this conference,
because it was an event that was highly covered by national press.
I'm curious, you know, now that you and NPR
obtain these tapes and we've published excerpts from these tapes,
what has the NRA said about all of this?
So after NPR obtained these tapes,
we reached out to the people who were on them for comment.
And of course, we also reached out to the NRA before publication.
What we did was we gave them transcripts of the clips
that we were thinking about using.
And the NRA responded.
They called it a quote unquote hit piece that was coming.
The NRA also said that we were invoking Columbine
to promote an editorial agenda against them.
And what's so interesting about this is that in responding this way,
they're using the same playbook that they created
and was shown in these tapes from over 20 years ago.
They're trying to change the topic from the core issues in these tapes.
Could you just give a sense of where the NRA stands right now?
The NRA is really in shambles financially.
In 2018, they almost couldn't make payroll.
That's a serious problem for any organization to be in.
The New York Attorney General launched an investigation
and after 18 months accused the NRA and Wayne LaPierre
and three others of contributing to the loss of more than $64 million
in just three years.
This is something that the New York Attorney General called fraud and abuse.
Now, the NRA was originally founded in New York,
so the New York AG has jurisdiction over the organization.
The NRA has said that her action, her office's action,
is part of a politically motivated attack
and that they've become a more accountable organization in the time since.
So, when we look back now at these tapes that you just obtained
and can hear these executives,
some of them who are still with the NRA,
talk about the strategy.
I mean, what do those tapes tell us about the NRA and gun politics
and how those have evolved over the last two decades?
You know, the tapes really show the NRA's policies
and its playbook being developed in real time.
Just take a listen to what Heston said back in 1999
to close out the convention this is all about.
The dirty secret of this day and age is that political gain
and media ratings all too often bloom on fresh graves.
That line, which was originally strategized on these NRA tapes,
is something they use over and over again in the years to come.
But they say it in slightly different ways.
Take a listen to Wayne LaPierre talking after the shootings at Sandy Hook in 2012.
Out of respect for the families and until the facts are known,
the NRA has refrained from comment.
While some have tried to exploit tragedy for political gain,
we have remained respectively silent.
This theme that you can't talk about firearms policy after mass shootings
continues throughout the years.
Here's Wayne LaPierre after the shootings in Parkland in 2018.
As usual, the opportunist wasted not one second
to exploit tragedy for political gain.
The break-back speed of calls for more gun control laws
and the breathless national media eager to smear the NRA.
So what do you think these tapes tell us about the NRA
and gun politics over these last two decades?
You look at the events after these tapes,
the mass shootings that followed after Columbine.
You had Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook and Parkland
and all sorts of other mass shootings that have occurred over the last 20 years.
And then you look at what's actually occurred in terms of legislation responding to them.
At the federal level, at least,
there's been no significant gun control legislation passed since these tapes.
And in the meantime, they've been able to advance gun rights legislation.
And that's true even though the NRA is in such a weak position now.
Yeah, what the NRA does so successfully
is that they're able to mobilize its grassroots members.
Politicians aren't really scared as much about the NRA's money.
They're worried about getting yelled at at town halls
and having their phone lines lit up and their email boxes flooded.
And the people the NRA is most able to mobilize
are these wackos, these so-called fruitcakes, these hillbillies.
So even though the NRA leadership was complaining about
what they viewed as the quote unquote fruitcakes, the wackos,
those members who they denigrated in this way
are really the source of strength for the NRA and the gun rights movement.
Yeah, and the decisions, the strategy that they developed after Columbine on these secret tapes,
they worked to help the NRA defend themselves
in the wake of these mass shootings again and again and again.
Tim, thanks so much.
