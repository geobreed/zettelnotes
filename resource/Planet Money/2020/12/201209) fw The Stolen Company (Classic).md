When an American company named ABRO learns their goods are being counterfeited in China, they start their own trade war. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

This episode originally ran in 2019.

Tim Demarais works for an American company called ABRO. The brand is a big deal in many foreign countries. They sell so much masking tape in places like Pakistan that when people there refer to a roll of masking tape, they'll often call it a roll of ABRO.

But back in 2002, ABRO's sales started to dip. Tim heard from a customer that counterfeit ABRO goods in China might be causing the problem. So, he flew over to investigate. What he discovered — the extent of the fraud — was shocking. And even more surprising, the company posing as ABRO insisted they were the real ABRO.

Today on the show, it's real ABRO vs. fake ABRO.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

In 2002, Tim Demarais noticed that sales at his company were slipping, and he couldn't figure out why.

NICK FOUNTAIN, HOST:

Tim was working for a small company in Indiana called Abro. They make things that handy people keep in their garage.

CHANG: You know, like epoxy glue, spark plugs, engine degreaser.

FOUNTAIN: And Tim's job was to travel the world, going anywhere he could sell Abro products.

TIM DEMARAIS: I was allowed to go as long as I could - as long as we brought back business. And we felt like buccaneers going to these emerging markets - Congo, and then in Russia, Ghana, Cameroon.

FOUNTAIN: Maybe you've never heard of Abro. I certainly hadn't. And that's because none of the stuff it makes actually gets sold in the U.S. But it's really popular in a lot of other places.

CHANG: Places where Made in America carries extra cachet.

DEMARAIS: Today, when you refer to a roll of masking tape in Pakistan, they simply ask, can you get me a roll of Abro?

FOUNTAIN: We're kind of a big deal in Pakistan.

CHANG: Anyways, Tim couldn't figure this out. Why were his sales slipping?

FOUNTAIN: And then he heard from a customer who had seen some counterfeit Abro products in China.

CHANG: Tim gets on a plane to investigate. His first stop is this trade show that everyone in his business goes to.

DEMARAIS: The Canton Trade Fair is one of the largest trade fairs in the world.

FOUNTAIN: His first day there, Tim's walking around this massive exhibition hall hunting for clues.

CHANG: And then, suddenly, he freezes.

DEMARAIS: I peered around the corner, hiding, really, behind a booth. And I looked around, and I was literally shocked to see what was in front of me.

CHANG: In front of Tim is a booth that looks to be an Abro booth. But the thing is Abro never paid for a booth at this fair. It's the same logo, same colors, same products, same everything. Only, no one inside the booth actually worked at Abro.

DEMARAIS: They were passing out Abro business cards, Abro catalogs with all our products in it to my Abro customers that were visiting. So there was total confusion.

CHANG: Oh, my God.

DEMARAIS: They were telling people they were the Abro subsidiary in China.

FOUNTAIN: Tim knows Abro doesn't have a subsidiary in China, so he goes straight to the show officials to complain.

CHANG: He provides documents showing Abro has the real trademark registration for Abro in China. The officials confirm this with authorities in Beijing. And then, boom, they agree. They will raid the fake Abro booth with Tim.

DEMARAIS: We had police personnel. There were military personnel because...

CHANG: There were military guys in this entourage to raid the booth?

DEMARAIS: Absolutely, absolutely.

CHANG: Why?

DEMARAIS: Because - the military is part of these trade shows in China because they own some of the companies. So I'm marching. I'm leading my army of men. I feel like a general going to battle. I mean, it was kind of scary, but kind of exciting.

FOUNTAIN: Tim gets to the booth and gets right up in the face of the man who seems to be in charge of the operation.

DEMARAIS: I said, the party's over. Mr. Abro is here.

CHANG: But then the Chinese guy turns to him and says very calmly, no, you're the fake. And he reaches into a briefcase and pulls out a set of documents that he says shows he is the one who owns the Abro trademark in China.

FOUNTAIN: Everyone just sort of looks around at each other, stunned. And the show officials start backing off. They don't know who to believe here.

CHANG: But Tim - Tim knows something they don't know. He points to a 4-foot-tall poster inside the booth. It's a blown-up photograph of a woman who appears on every package of Abro epoxy glue.

DEMARAIS: I said to the owner, who is that woman you have in the photo? He said, that's just a Western model. At that moment, I lost it. I just lost it. I said, that is not a Western model; that is my wife. At that time, I just ripped out my wallet. I pulled out a picture of my wife I'd been carrying for last three years and threw it on the table in front of the owner of the company. I said, first, you steal our corporate identity. And now you're stealing my wife.

(SOUNDBITE OF RICHARD L. JONES, SKINNY WILLIAMS AND TRACY CURRY'S "UP ON THESE STICKS")

FOUNTAIN: Ailsa, I've been playing this moment over and over in my head. It's like that moment in "Good Will Hunting" where Matt Damon goes up to the guy, and he's like, yeah, well, I got her number. How do you like them apples?

CHANG: (Laughter) It worked. The next day, the fake Abro booth is empty.

FOUNTAIN: With a sad piece of tarp flung right over it.

CHANG: So was that the end of the story?

DEMARAIS: I wish it was, but that was only the beginning of the story.

FOUNTAIN: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Nick Fountain.

CHANG: And I'm Ailsa Chang. There's a story that's taken hold about China, and it goes something like this. China is garbage at protecting intellectual property.

FOUNTAIN: But Abro's story is different.

CHANG: Yeah. The reason I even know about them is because last year, when the Trump administration was collecting horror stories about American companies screwed over by China, Abro raised its hand and said, no, we think China is doing a great job.

FOUNTAIN: And we were like, what? We want to hear that story. So that's our show today.

(SOUNDBITE OF RICHARD L. JONES, SKINNY WILLIAMS AND TRACY CURRY'S "UP ON THESE STICKS")

CHANG: So Tim gets back to the U.S. And he's telling anyone who will listen about how he took down these Chinese counterfeiters with a picture of his wife.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah, about that. A few months later, Tim is in Saudi Arabia walking through a market when he sees something that looks like Abro's epoxy glue.

CHANG: But he notices there's something different about the packaging. Right where that picture of his wife usually appears...

DEMARAIS: The woman had an Asian face. They kept the same outfit my wife was wearing but just cut her head off and put the Asian face in there.

CHANG: Wait. So it was your wife's body on the bottom with an Asian head at the top?

DEMARAIS: Wife's body, counterfeit - wife's body, Asian face. Very clever.

FOUNTAIN: It's just so petty. Fake Abro took Tim's how-do-you-like-them-apples moment and said, how do you like them apples right back?

CHANG: And that right there is the moment that Tim vows to himself, I'm going to take these guys down.

DEMARAIS: My wife's picture was the face that launched a thousand lawsuits.

CHANG: But before Abro can bring any lawsuit against fake Abro, they need to figure out who these impostors are. They trace the counterfeit goods to Hunan province to a company called Hunan Magic. And he learned that the person at the top of Hunan Magic is a man named Yuan Hongwei.

FOUNTAIN: And Tim realizes he's actually met this guy before. He's the one Tim confronted inside the booth in China.

CHANG: Now, you're going to be hearing a lot about Yuan Hongwei and Hunan Magic in this story. And we wanted you to hear their side. But after a long back-and-forth, they decided they didn't want to talk to us.

FOUNTAIN: So according to Tim, the next thing that happens is Abro files a lawsuit in Chinese court against Hunan Magic. But it's slow going. And the whole time, the Abro brand all around the world is taking a beating.

DEMARAIS: And then they came up with several other products that we didn't even have, like a rat poison, and called it Abro rat poison.

(LAUGHTER)

DEMARAIS: They were doing all kinds of wild stuff.

CHANG: And he says the products Hunan Magic is selling under the Abro brand - they're horrible. Abro glue, for example, normally has a shelf life of one year, minimum. Hunan Magic's counterfeit glue would get hard in the tube within days.

FOUNTAIN: So Abro decides it needs another plan, or else Hunan Magic could end up killing their business.

CHANG: It was time to bring in the professionals.

DEMARAIS: You see "Pulp Fiction"?

CHANG: Yeah.

DEMARAIS: OK. So when they got two dead bodies in the back of the car, you call in The Wolf. We were kind of like that for trademarks.

FOUNTAIN: Bill Mansfield is a former private investigator who helps people with special trademark problems when a lawsuit just isn't enough.

CHANG: He used to go undercover as a counterfeiter - usually a Russian, for whatever reason - to collect intel on badly behaving companies. Bill will be the first to tell you, though, he does not look the part of a typical badass.

BILL MANSFIELD: I'm perfectly round. I'm a perfect circle, if you saw me.

CHANG: You mean you're rotund?

MANSFIELD: I am a sphere with legs and arms and a little head on top.

CHANG: Like Mr. Happy - you know the book character?

MANSFIELD: Yes. OK. Yes.

FOUNTAIN: With his work, though, he is not so Mr. Happy. He tells Abro the surest way to get these guys to stop is you got to make it hurt. You've got to make counterfeiting so costly, so painful that the counterfeiters will have no choice but to back off. And so far, that's just not happening in China.

CHANG: So Bill says it's time to bring these guys onto home turf. He digs around and finds an obscure law in Louisiana, which is incredibly harsh when it comes to counterfeiters.

FOUNTAIN: Like, down there, you can get sentenced to hard labor for counterfeiting.

CHANG: OK, so you were looking at that, and you were thinking, I could get Yuan Hongwei on a chain gang. That is my goal.

MANSFIELD: Yes, because the system that he was in - it wasn't deterring him in any way.

CHANG: But to nail Yuan Hongwei on this counterfeiting law, Bill needs to get him on Louisiana soil so the police can arrest him. Bill hatches a plan to set up a fake company in Livingston Parish that starts doing business with Hunan Magic.

FOUNTAIN: And his fake company orders shipping containers full of counterfeit glue from Hunan Magic, which will become the evidence they need for an arrest.

CHANG: The relationship's going great. And at one point, an undercover guy at the fake Louisiana company tells Hunan Magic, hey, you should come over to Livingston Parish some time for a visit to teach us how to grow our business as your distributor.

FOUNTAIN: And they accept the invite. Bill has just two weeks to set up a sting operation.

CHANG: The plan is to give Yuan Hongwei a tour of the fake company, which Bill needs to build from scratch.

MANSFIELD: It had to look lived-in. It had to look real. It had to be so that if you dug into it, you would find things not only that didn't make you suspicious, but that confirmed that this was a real, living, breathing office space and that people had walked out of it Friday at 5 p.m. and they'd walk back in Monday at 8 a.m. and there were things going on. And we had fake storylines built into it.

CHANG: Like what?

MANSFIELD: Two of the people in the office were having an affair. And if you'd...

CHANG: How did you portray that?

MANSFIELD: Well, if you looked through the trash, you'd find crumpled up little love notes between them.

CHANG: Really?

MANSFIELD: Yeah.

FOUNTAIN: They went all-out.

CHANG: The day of the visit rolls around. Representatives from Hunan Magic show up, but not Yuan Hongwei. He's the one Abro needed, the one they wanted to arrest.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. He's no dummy. He'd outsmarted them. Bill's sting operation was a bust.

CHANG: But then, several months later, Hunan Magic unexpectedly calls up Abro and makes a surprising offer. Hire us, they say. Let Hunan Magic become one of your manufacturers. We are making a bunch of your stuff already anyway.

FOUNTAIN: Abro's listening to this and thinking, wait a minute; there is still an arrest warrant out for Yuan Hongwei in Louisiana. All we have to do is get him on U.S. soil, and he's finished. So they say, we love this idea. Y'all should come to Indiana. Let's meet.

MANSFIELD: Yuan Hongwei is also not an idiot and said, no, I don't think so, but I will be in London in three weeks. Let's meet there.

CHANG: And that is when Bill Mansfield gets the call from Abro.

FOUNTAIN: Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get Yuan Hongwei arrested in London and then extradited to the U.S.

MANSFIELD: Our chance had finally fallen open, but it was very soon, and it was in another country. And it was my job to figure it out and make it happen, or, to some extent, all this might have been a waste.

CHANG: Bill spends three sleepless weeks trying to organize the arrest of a Chinese citizen in London based on a warrant from Louisiana.

MANSFIELD: And by the time he touched down in London at Heathrow Airport, his plane taxied left instead of right, came to a stop. Police came on, took him off in cuffs.

CHANG: Yuan Hongwei is behind bars for a while. And then right before his extradition hearing, he posts bail and is released. But he's told, you have to remain in London.

FOUNTAIN: But instead, he disappears.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOSE E. SANCHEZ JR. AND JOSE E. SANCHEZ SR. SONG, "LA TRAICION")

CHANG: After the break, Abro finally figures out how to shut this whole thing down.

FOUNTAIN: It does not include catching Yuan Hongwei. That's just never going to happen.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOSE E. SANCHEZ JR. AND JOSE E. SANCHEZ SR. SONG, "LA TRAICION")

CHANG: It's not like the U.S. government wasn't doing anything to protect Abro. They had a guy in Beijing working the case.

FOUNTAIN: His name is Mark Cohen. When the State Department created a new position at the embassy to deal with counterfeiting in China, Mark was the one who got the job.

CHANG: He was the perfect person for the gig. Not only was he an IP lawyer, he has this deep understanding of Chinese culture. His Mandarin puts mine to shame.

So could you recite, say, a Tang dynasty poem for me right now in Mandarin?

MARK COHEN: Well, you know, the most common is (speaking Mandarin).

CHANG: Of course. Yeah. The most common.

COHEN: (Speaking Mandarin). You know, that's the most famous poem.

FOUNTAIN: All right.

CHANG: Anyway, Mark got wind of the problem Abro was having with Hunan Magic. And he learns that Abro isn't the only company Yuan Hongwei is knocking off.

FOUNTAIN: Mark's like, I want to talk to this guy, see if I can reason with him. But Yuan Hongwei is really hard to get in touch with.

COHEN: He's a type of counterfeiter that we used to call - in Chinese, we call them shanzhai (ph), mountain stronghold counterfeiters - these guys who operate in kind of more remote, harder-to-enforce places.

CHANG: So Mark travels down to Hunan province himself to see if he can meet face-to-face with Yuan Hongwei. But before he confronts him, he decides, I better go talk to the local officials first. Sometimes, they can be helpful in these matters.

FOUNTAIN: But when he gets to their office, he sees something that makes him really nervous.

COHEN: I saw a window display with a bunch of awards given to Hunan Magic.

CHANG: What were the awards for?

COHEN: Oh, famous brand, innovative company, high-tech company. And you could see these awards...

CHANG: Wow.

COHEN: You could see these awards today if you go to the Hunan Magic website under Chinese, where it says Awards.

CHANG: They're still bragging about these honors.

COHEN: They're still bragging. And the dates, you will notice, are 2002, 2003, 2004.

CHANG: When they're counterfeiting products.

COHEN: Absolutely. This is a typical game. You know, pretend to be the most honorable company in the world to your own countrymen, knock off the foreigners.

FOUNTAIN: Right then and there, Mark decides it's just not worth it.

CHANG: Because all these awards mean local officials are probably going to protect Hunan Magic.

COHEN: I decided it was - it would be unsafe for me to try to meet with local government officials.

CHANG: Unsafe?

COHEN: Yeah.

CHANG: As in physically unsafe?

COHEN: Yeah, yeah.

FOUNTAIN: Yuan Hongwei may have impressed local officials, but they weren't there to protect him in London.

CHANG: Abro had set in motion a series of events that made counterfeiting just painful enough for Yuan Hongwei. He was threatened with hard labor in Louisiana, had to spend weeks in a foreign jail cell and then had to secretly flee back to China.

FOUNTAIN: Not the usual cost of doing business for making knockoff glue.

CHANG: Even though Bill had lost Yuan Hongwei in London, Bill actually won because after London, Yuan Hongwei stopped counterfeiting Abro products.

FOUNTAIN: But Bill's problems with Abro counterfeiters didn't quite end there.

MANSFIELD: Beating Hunan Magic - beating this major counterfeiter - it was similar to how - when we beat the Soviet Union.

CHANG: What do you mean?

MANSFIELD: Well, after the Soviet Union fell, there was a part of us that said, hey, we won the Cold War. We don't have any more problems. What we just had were smaller and different problems.

CHANG: Here's what was happening. Even though Hunan Magic was out of the picture, its temporary success at ripping off Abro had spawned copycat counterfeiters elsewhere - in Angola, Ecuador and, of course, other places in China.

FOUNTAIN: Which meant Abro had a bigger and more complex problem. It couldn't just hire Bill to go around the world planning expensive sting operations and extraditions.

MANSFIELD: What do we do? We have to stop the counterfeiters. But now we've got a bunch of them, and we have to do it in a way that still leaves the business profitable, or what's the point?

CHANG: Right. Well, when it came to China, Bill, who, remember, loves an elaborate sting operation - he discovered over time that the solution wasn't all that complicated or expensive. Instead, it involved drinking a lot of tea.

MANSFIELD: It's very good.

CHANG: What kind of tea?

MANSFIELD: And the - government tea - I'm not real clear. I'm not - I don't have - I have what's known as a gutter palate.

CHANG: Bill has found that in China, local authorities have a ton of power.

FOUNTAIN: So what he does now is set up lots of meetings - meetings with the people who can launch investigations, that conduct raids, seize counterfeit products and arrest counterfeiters.

MANSFIELD: I always prefer criminal action. An arrest is always what I'm looking for. A time - some time in jail is never worth selling counterfeit glue.

CHANG: If you ask Bill, this is how to stop counterfeiters in China and elsewhere - lots and lots of meetings. He's been at it 11 years now. He says he's traveled to 55 countries, gotten at least a dozen people convicted and millions of dollars of counterfeit goods destroyed.

How do you reward these local authorities after a raid goes down? Do you take them out to dinner?

MANSFIELD: I award them with the key currency all bureaucrats love.

CHANG: Which is?

MANSFIELD: Which is a thank you and, often, a small plaque.

CHANG: Plaque?

MANSFIELD: A small plaque they can put in their office. It's a foreign plaque. And it says, you know, that you helped us. And I like to give them - I make sure they know who they helped.

CHANG: You really think that excites them - a plaque that they can hang up in their office? That's really why they're helping you?

MANSFIELD: The people I'm working with, yes. They want to be - people want to be appreciated for their work. You know, I thought a lot - I...

CHANG: Are you sure you never bribe people, Bill?

MANSFIELD: No, never.

FOUNTAIN: We asked Bill about bribery several more times. And each time, he swore it never happens.

CHANG: But I have to admit it all seemed too simple to me - this idea that the solution to protecting intellectual property in China is just to schmooze with local officials. I mean, how typical is Abro? We keep hearing stories about how the Chinese don't respect intellectual property, stories about trade secret theft, patent infringement, forced technology transfers. How can it be that the solution to all that is just to sit down with a lot of bureaucrats, drink a lot of tea and give out a lot of plaques?

I went back and I talked to Mark Cohen about this. And he was like, yeah, that works sometimes. But here's the way you got to think about it. China does protect some foreign IP. He pointed me to cases involving vacuum cleaners, water heaters and, of course, glue. But he said what's important to look at is what China isn't protecting.

COHEN: I believe, based on the data that's available in cases, that in general, if it's an area that's important to China - let's say semiconductors, let's say the IT sector, let's say pharma - that your chances of getting a fair shake are not nearly as great as something that is of less critical importance to China's industrial needs.

CHANG: Like glue?

COHEN: Like glue, yeah.

CHANG: So you think maybe that's why, in the end, Abro's found a way to make the system in China work for the company - because they're just selling glue. They're not selling semiconductor technology.

COHEN: China does not, as far as I know, have a five-year industrial plan on glue. So, yes, China is able and willing to protect foreign glue from that set of circumstances. Semiconductors - a different story.

Hey, quick note.
Today we're running an episode that I worked on back in 2019.
It's a story about fraud and the hijinks that one American company had to go through
to stop a counterfeiter.
Hope you like it.
In 2002, Tim Damaris noticed that sales at his company were slipping and he couldn't
figure out why.
Tim was working for a small company in Indiana called Abro.
They make things that handy people keep in their garage.
You know, like epoxy glue, spark plugs, engine degreaser.
And Tim's job was to travel the world going anywhere he could sell Abro products.
I was allowed to go as long as I could, as long as we brought back business.
We felt like buccaneers going to these emerging markets.
Congo and then Russia, Ghana, Cameroon.
Maybe you've never heard of Abro.
I certainly hadn't.
And that's because none of the stuff it makes actually gets sold in the U.S.
But it's really popular in a lot of other places.
Places where made in America carries extra cachet.
Today, when you refer to a roll of masking tape in Pakistan, they simply ask, can
you get me a roll of Abro?
We're kind of a big deal in Pakistan.
Anyways, Tim couldn't figure this out.
Why were his sales slipping?
And then he heard from a customer who had seen some counterfeit Abro products.
Tim gets on a plane to investigate.
His first stop is this trade show that everyone in his business goes to.
The Canton Trade Fair is one of the largest trade fairs in the world.
His first day there, Tim's walking around this massive exhibition hall hunting for clues.
And then suddenly he freezes.
I peered around the corner, hiding really behind a booth, and I looked around and
I was literally shocked to see what I was in front of me.
In front of Tim is a booth that looks to be an Abro booth.
But the thing is, Abro never paid for a booth at this fair.
It's the same logo, same colors, same products, same everything.
Only no one inside the booth actually worked at Abro.
They were passing out Abro business cards, Abro catalogs with all our
products in it to my Abro customers that were visiting.
So it was total confusion.
Oh my God.
They were telling people they were the Abro subsidiary in China.
Tim knows Abro doesn't have a subsidiary in China.
So he goes straight to the show officials to complain.
He provides documents showing Abro has the real trademark registration for
Abro in China.
The officials confirm this with authorities in Beijing.
And then boom, they agree.
They will raid the fake Abro booth with Tim.
We had police personnel.
There were military personnel because-
There were military guys in this entourage to raid the booth?
Absolutely, absolutely.
Wow.
Because the military is part of these trade shows in China because they
own some of the companies.
So I'm marching.
I'm leading my army of men.
I feel like a general going to battle.
I mean, it was kind of scary, but it was kind of exciting.
Tim gets to the booth and gets right up in the face of the man who seems
to be in charge of the operation.
I said, the party's over.
Mr. Abro is here.
But then the Chinese guy turns to him and says very calmly, no,
you're the fake.
And he reaches into a briefcase and pulls out a set of documents that he
says shows he is the one who owns the Abro trademark in China.
Everyone just sort of looks around at each other stunned.
And the show officials start backing off.
They don't know who to believe here.
But Tim, Tim knows something they don't know.
He points to a four foot tall poster inside the booth.
It's a blown up photograph of a woman who appears on every package
of Abro epoxy glue.
I said, the owner, who is that woman you have in the photo?
He said, that's just a Western model.
At that moment, I lost it.
I just lost it.
I said, that is not a Western model.
That is my wife.
At that time, I just ripped out my wallet.
I pulled out a picture of my wife I've been carrying for the last three
years and threw it on the table in front of the owner of the company.
They said, first you steal our corporate identity,
and now you're stealing my wife.
Elsa, I've been playing this moment over and over in my head.
It's like that moment in Good Will Hunting
where Matt Damon goes up to the guy and he's like,
yeah, well, I got a number.
How do you like them apples?
It worked.
The next day, the fake Abro booth is empty.
With a sad piece of tarp flung right over it.
So was that the end of the story?
Oh, I wish it was, but that was only the beginning of the story.

with a picture of his wife.
Yeah, about that.
A few months later, Tim is in Saudi Arabia,
walking through a market when he sees something that
looks like Abro's epoxy glue.
But he notices there's something
different about the packaging, right where
that picture of his wife usually appears.
The woman had an Asian face.
They kept the same outfit my wife was wearing,
but just cut her head off and put the Asian face in there.
Wait, so it was your wife's body
on the bottom with an Asian head at the top?
Wife's body, Asian face.
Very clever.
It's just so petty.
Fake Abro took Tim's how do you like them apples moment
and said, how do you like them apples right back?
And that right there is the moment
that Tim vows to himself.
I'm going to take these guys down.
My wife's picture is the face
that launched 1,000 lawsuits.
But before Abro can bring any lawsuit against fake Abro,
they need to figure out who these imposters are.
They trace the counterfeit goods to Hunan province
to a company called Hunan Magic.
And they learn that the person at the top of Hunan Magic
is a man named Yuan Hongwei.
And Tim realizes he's actually met this guy before.
He's the one Tim confronted inside the booth in China.
Now, you're going to be hearing a lot
about Yuan Hongwei and Hunan Magic in this story.
And we wanted you to hear their side.
But after a long back and forth,
they decided they didn't want to talk to us.
So according to Tim,
the next thing that happens is Abro files a lawsuit
in Chinese court against Hunan Magic,
but it's slow going.
And the whole time,
the Abro brand all around the world is taking a beating.
And then they came up with several other products
that we didn't even have like a rat poison
and called it Abro rat poison.
They were doing all kinds of wild stuff.
And he says the products Hunan Magic is selling
under the Abro brand, they're horrible.
Abro Glue, for example,
normally has a shelf life of one year minimum.
Hunan Magic's counterfeit glue
would get hard in the tube within days.
So Abro decides it needs another plan
or else Hunan Magic could end up killing their business.
It was time to bring in the professionals.
You see Pulp Fiction?
Yeah.
Okay, so when they get two dead bodies
in the back of the car, you call in the wolf.
We were kind of like that for trademarks.
Bill Mansfield is a former private investigator
who helps people with special trademark problems
when a lawsuit just isn't enough.
He used to go undercover as a counterfeiter,
usually a Russian for whatever reason,
to collect intel on badly behaving companies.
Bill will be the first to tell you though,
he does not look the part of a typical badass.
I'm perfectly round.
I'm a perfect circle.
If you saw me.
You mean you're rotund?
I am a sphere with legs and arms
and a little head on top.
Like Mr. Happy, you know the book character?
Yes, okay, yes.
With his work though, he is not so Mr. Happy.
He tells Abro the surest way to get these guys to stop
is you gotta make it hurt.
You gotta make counterfeiting so costly, so painful
that the counterfeiters will have no choice
but to back off.
And so far, that's just not happening in China.
So Bill says it's time to bring these guys onto home turf.
He digs around and finds an obscure law in Louisiana,
which is incredibly harsh when it comes to counterfeiters.
Like down there, you can get sentenced to hard labor
for counterfeiting.
Okay, so you were looking at that and you were thinking
I could get Yuan Hongwei on a chain gang.
That is my goal.
Yes, because the system that he was in,
it wasn't deterring him in any way.
But to nail Yuan Hongwei on this counterfeiting law,
Bill needs to get him on Louisiana soil
so the police can arrest him.
Bill hatches a plan to set up a fake company
in Livingston Parish that starts doing business
with Hunan Magic.
And his fake company orders shipping containers
full of counterfeit glue from Hunan Magic,
which will become the evidence they need for an arrest.
The relationship's going great and at one point,
an undercover guy at the fake Louisiana company
tells Hunan Magic, hey, you should come over
to Livingston Parish sometime for a visit
to teach us how to grow our business as your distributor.
And they accept the invite.
Bill has just two weeks to set up a sting operation.
The plan is to give Yuan Hongwei
a tour of the fake company,
which Bill needs to build from scratch.
It had to look lived in, it had to look real.
It had to be so that if you dug into it,
you would find things,
not only that didn't make you suspicious,
but they confirmed that this was a real, living,
breathing office space and that people had walked out
of it Friday at 5 p.m.
and they'd walked back in Monday at 8 a.m.
and there were things going on.
We had fake storylines built into it.
Like what?
Two of the people in the office were having an affair.
And if you went through-
How did you portray that?
Well, if you looked through the trash,
you'd find crumpled up little love notes between them.
Really?
Yeah, they went all out.
The day of the visit rolls around,
representatives from Hunan Magic show up,
but not Yuan Hongwei.
He's the one Abro needed,
the one they wanted to arrest.
Yeah, he's no dummy.
He'd outsmarted them.
Bill Sting operation was a bust.
But then several months later,
Hunan Magic unexpectedly calls up Abro
and makes a surprising offer.
Hire us, they say.
Let Hunan Magic become one of your manufacturers.
We are making a bunch of your stuff already anyway.
Abro's listening to this and thinking,
wait a minute,
there is still an arrest warrant out
for Yuan Hongwei in Louisiana.
All we have to do is get him on US soil
and he's finished.
So they say, we love this idea.
Y'all should come to Indiana.
Let's meet.
Yuan Hongwei is also not an idiot
and said, no, I don't think so,
but I will be in London in three weeks.
Let's meet there.
And that is when Bill Mansfield gets the call from Abro.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it,
is to get Yuan Hongwei arrested in London
and then extradited to the US.
Our chance had finally fallen open,
but it was very soon and it was in another country
and it was my job to figure it out and make it happen
or to some extent, all this might've been a waste.
Bill spends three sleepless weeks
trying to organize the arrest of a Chinese citizen
in London based on a warrant from Louisiana.
And by the time he touched down in London
at Heathrow Airport,
his plane taxied left instead of right,
came to a stop,
police came on, took him off and coughs.
Yuan Hongwei is behind bars for a while
and then right before his extradition hearing,
he posts bail and is released,
but he's told you have to remain in London.
But instead, he disappears.
After the break,
Abro finally figures out how to shut
this whole thing down.
It does not include catching Yuan Hongwei.
That is just never gonna happen.
You know the names of the primary players,
Jimmy Carter.
Our country's not strong anymore.

Let's go!
But how they acted,
it's just about the opposite of their popular images.

It's not like the US government
wasn't doing anything to protect Abro.
They had a guy in Beijing working the case.
His name is Mark Cohen.
When the State Department created a new position
at the embassy to deal with counterfeiting in China,
Mark was the one who got the job.
He was the perfect person for the gig.
Not only was he an IP lawyer,
he has this deep understanding of Chinese culture.
His Mandarin puts mine to shame.
So could you recite, say,
a Tang dynasty poem for me right now in Mandarin?
Well, you know, the most common is
床山明月光,一雪地上窗,
九頭王明月,地頭四谷香.
You know, that's the most famous poem.
All right.
Anyway, Mark got wind of the problem
Abro was having with Hunan Magic,
and he learns that Abro isn't the only company
Yuan Hongwei is knocking off.
Mark's like, I wanna talk to this guy,
see if I can reason with him.
But Yuan Hongwei is really hard to get in touch with.
He's a type of counterfeiter that we used to call,
in Chinese we call them 山寨,
mountain stronghold counterfeiters.
These guys who operate in kind of more remote,
harder to enforce places.
So Mark travels down to Hunan province himself
to see if he can meet face-to-face with Yuan Hongwei.
But before he confronts him, he decides,
I better go talk to the local officials first.
Sometimes they can be helpful in these matters.
But when he gets to their office,
he sees something that makes him really nervous.
I saw a window display with a bunch of awards
given to Hunan Magic.
What were the awards for?
Oh, famous brand, innovative company, high-tech company.
And you could see these awards today
if you go to the Hunan Magic website
under Chinese where it says awards.
They're still bragging about these honors.
And the dates you will notice
are 2002, 2003, 2004.
When they're counterfeiting products.
Absolutely, this is a typical game.
Pretend to be the most honorable company in the world
to your own countrymen, knock off the foreigners.
Right then and there, Mark decides,
it's just not worth it.
Because all these awards mean local officials
are probably gonna protect Hunan Magic.
I decided it would be unsafe for me
to try to meet with local government officials.
As in physically unsafe?
Yeah, yeah.
Yuan Hongwei may have impressed local officials,
but they weren't there to protect him in London.
Abro had set in motion a series of events
that made counterfeiting just painful enough
for Yuan Hongwei.
He was threatened with hard labor in Louisiana,
had to spend weeks in a foreign jail cell,
and then had to secretly flee back to China.
Not the usual cost of doing business
for making knockoff clue.
Even though Bill had lost Yuan Hongwei in London,
Bill actually won.
Because after London, Yuan Hongwei
stopped counterfeiting Abro products.
But Bill's problems with Abro counterfeiters
didn't quite end there.
Beating Hunan Magic, beating this major counterfeiter,
it was similar to how when we beat the Soviet Union.
What do you mean?
Well, after the Soviet Union fell,
there was a part of us that said,
hey, we won the Cold War,
we don't have any more problems.
What we just had were smaller and different problems.
Here's what was happening.
Even though Hunan Magic was out of the picture,
its temporary success at ripping off Abro
had spawned copycat counterfeiters elsewhere,
in Angola, Ecuador,
and of course other places in China.
Which meant Abro had a bigger and more complex problem.
It couldn't just hire Bill to go around the world
planning expensive sting operations
and extraditions.
What do we do?
We have to stop the counterfeiters,
but now we've got a bunch of them
and we have to do it in a way
that still leaves the business profitable.
Or what's the point?
Right.
Well, when it came to China,
Bill, who remember loves an elaborate sting operation,
he discovered over time that the solution
wasn't all that complicated or expensive.
Instead, it involved drinking a lot of tea.
It's very good.
What kind of tea?
Government tea?
I'm not real clear.
I'm not, I don't have,
I have what's known as a gutter palette.
Bill has found that in China,
local authorities have a ton of power.
So what he does now is set up lots of meetings.
Meetings with the people
who can launch investigations,
to conduct raids,
seize counterfeit products,
and arrest counterfeiters.
I always prefer criminal action.
An arrest is always what I'm looking for.
A time, some time in jail
is never worth selling counterfeit glue.
If you ask Bill,
this is how to stop counterfeiters in China
and elsewhere.
Lots and lots of meetings.
He's been at it 11 years now.
He says he's traveled to 55 countries,
gotten at least a dozen people convicted,
and millions of dollars of counterfeit goods destroyed.
How do you reward these local authorities
after a raid goes down?
Do you take them out to dinner?
I award them with the key currency
all bureaucrats love,
which is, thank you.
And often a small plaque,
a small plaque they can put in their office.
It's a foreign plaque,
and it says that you helped us.
And I like to give them,
make sure they know who they helped,
that they see pictures of people.
You really think that excites them,
a plaque that they can hang up in their office?
That's really why they're helping you?
The people I'm working with, yes.
That they wanna be,
people wanna be appreciated for their work.
I thought a lot of,
I spent a lot of time-
Do you never bribe people, Bill?
No, never.
We asked Bill about bribery several more times.
And each time he swore it never happens.
But I have to admit,
it all seemed too simple to me.
This idea that the solution
to protecting intellectual property in China
is just to schmooze with local officials.
I mean, how typical is Abro?
We keep hearing stories
about how the Chinese don't respect intellectual property.
Stories about trade secret theft,
patent infringement, forced technology transfers.
How can it be that the solution to all that
is just to sit down with a lot of bureaucrats,
drink a lot of tea,
and give out a lot of plaques?
I went back and I talked to Mark Cohen about this.
And he was like,
yeah, that works sometimes.
But here's the way you gotta think about it.
China does protect some foreign IP.
He pointed me to cases involving vacuum cleaners,
water heaters, and of course glue.
But he said what's important to look at
is what China isn't protecting.
I believe based on the data that's available
and cases that in general,
if it's an area that's important to China,
let's say semiconductors,
let's say the IT sector,
let's say pharma,
that your chances of getting a fair shake
are not nearly as great
as something that is of less critical importance
to China's industrial needs.
Like glue?
Like glue, yeah.
So you think maybe that's why in the end,
Abro's found a way to make the system in China
work for the company,
because they're just selling glue.
They're not selling semiconductor technology.
China does not, as far as I know,
have a five-year industrial plan on glue.
So yes, China is able and willing to protect
foreign glue in that set of circumstances.
Semiconductors, a different story.
