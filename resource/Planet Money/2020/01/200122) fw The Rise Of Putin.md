MARY CHILDS, HOST:

Last week, Vladimir Putin was on stage, giving his annual State of the Nation address. He proposed a few Constitutional changes. Give lots of new powers to a previously minor state council. Give more power to Parliament to choose Cabinet Ministers. Close the loophole that allows a president to serve more than two terms, as long as they’re not consecutive. And each of these proposals, on their own, might sound fairly moderate.

But the Russian Prime Minister — who was once actually a close Putin ally — immediately resigned, taking his entire Cabinet with him. And that’s shocking news, even for Russia. That’s because these proposals taken together are not moderate tweaks — they actually pave a way for Vladimir Putin to continue to run the country, maybe for life.

So we at Planet Money thought now would be an excellent time to rebroadcast an episode on the early years of Vladimir Putin. It’s by our friends at NPR’s history podcast, Throughline. Here it is.

RUND ABDELFATAH, HOST:

OK, we're going to take you back to 2009 for a minute, to a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and a bunch of wealthy Russian factory owners.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN: (Speaking Russian).

ABDELFATAH: Now, just imagine the scene - Putin, whose voice we're hearing, is sitting at the head of a long rectangular conference table. He's got on jeans and a windbreaker, and guys in suits are sitting around that table, hanging on his every word. And the Russian press is there to capture it all.

RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, HOST:

Putin is asking the group, why haven't you fixed this labor dispute yet? You were running around - and I quote - "like cockroaches" before I came.

ABDELFATAH: And it's no accident that he's dragging them through the mud in front of the Russian press. This is a publicity stunt.

ARABLOUEI: So after scolding them like children, Putin makes them all sign a contract ordering them to reopen their factories.

ABDELFATAH: And he picks out one particular factory owner who - again, no accident - is a prominent Russian billionaire, whose name, by the way, has come up several times in the Mueller investigation - Oleg Deripaska.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PUTIN: (Speaking Russian).

ARABLOUEI: "Did everyone sign this?"

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PUTIN: (Speaking Russian).

ARABLOUEI: "Deripaska, have you signed?"

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

OLEG DERIPASKA: (Speaking Russian).

ARABLOUEI: "Yes, I have signed."

ABDELFATAH: Still, Putin makes Deripaska get up out of his seat, walk all the way around the table and sign the contract again. And as Deripaska walks away, Putin says...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PUTIN: (Non-English language spoken).

ARABLOUEI: "Give me back my pen."

ABDELFATAH: And makes Deripaska walk all the way back over to hand it to him.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: Hey, I'm Rund Abdelfatah.

ARABLOUEI: I'm Ramtin Arablouei.

ABDELFATAH: And on this episode...

ARABLOUEI: Decoding the power of Vladimir Putin.

ABDELFATAH: So that video we opened with - it honestly felt like I was watching a scene from a mobster movie.

ARABLOUEI: Yeah. I mean, Putin pretty much casts himself as a mob boss in that meeting. Like, he's really trying hard to portray himself as a tough guy.

ABDELFATAH: So that got us thinking - how did Russia come to be run by this guy, Vladimir Putin?

ARABLOUEI: Today, when you say Russia, you might as well be saying Putin because he's been running the country for nearly 20 years.

ABDELFATAH: And on the one hand, you have this over-the-top image of Putin - the mob boss, the guy who rides shirtless on horseback or scuba dives for ancient treasures.

ARABLOUEI: That, of course, he always finds. And all of this is designed to make him seem unstoppable.

ABDELFATAH: So these images of Putin that we see, how do they come to be, and how do they help him maintain power?

ARABLOUEI: To answer those questions, we have to understand how he became the person we see today.

ABDELFATAH: Kind of like a Ghost of Christmas Past for Vladimir Putin.

ARABLOUEI: (Laughter) Exactly.

ABDELFATAH: There's an international escape in St. Petersburg.

ARABLOUEI: A bombing conspiracy...

ABDELFATAH: ...And a reality TV makeover.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARABLOUEI: Part 1 - the great escape.

ABDELFATAH: We're going to start the story where Vladimir Putin's career began.

ARABLOUEI: In the Soviet Union's notorious intelligence service.

ABDELFATAH: The KGB.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

EDWARD LUCAS: Putin started off as a rather junior and probably not very successful KGB officer.

ABDELFATAH: This is Edward Lucas. He worked for The Economist and was their Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002.

ARABLOUEI: So Putin, fresh out of law school, was recruited to join the KGB way back in 1975.

ABDELFATAH: Not a lot is known about that time in his life. But what we do know is that, in 1985, he was assigned to a post in a city in East Germany called Dresden.

LUCAS: Which was a bit of a backwater.

ABDELFATAH: And that meant he was too far from the capital, Berlin, to experience all the exciting spy games that were playing out there during the height of the Cold War.

LUCAS: And it's not clear that he ever ran any agents or conducted any real espionage operations. There's some suggestion that his main job was to be in counterintelligence. His job was checking up on other people, which is a sort of necessary but often rather unpopular job in intelligence agencies.

ABDELFATAH: Putin spent five years in Dresden and a total of 16 years in the KGB, all the while slowly working his way up the ladder, doing the jobs necessary to get ahead. But then, in 1991...

ABDELFATAH: The world came crashing down around him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MIKHAIL GORBACHEV: (Non-English language spoken).

ABDELFATAH: Just months after an attempted coup, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned from his position as president of the Soviet Union, effectively bringing it to an end.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GORBACHEV: (Non-English language spoken).

LUCAS: It was as if a tide were rushing down the beach, and you could then see the kind of stony outcrops of real power.

ARABLOUEI: Suddenly, the country went from having a centralized communist economy to something that was more privatized.

ABDELFATAH: It was a wildly unstable time for everyone in Russia. A free market emerged that was poorly managed and a breeding ground for corruption.

ARABLOUEI: Mobsters and other criminals took advantage of the instability, and Russia's massive wealth was picked off by a few at the top.

ABDELFATAH: Amid all that, a new leader came to power in Russia. His name - Boris Yeltsin.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BORIS YELTSIN: (Non-English language spoken).

ARABLOUEI: He tried to stabilize the Russian economy, but his methods were pretty shady. Yeltsin's government more or less acted like the Mafia - you do me a favor, I owe you, return a favor later, et cetera - you know, good, old-fashioned corruption.

STEVE SESTANOVICH: Increasingly, in the '90s, there was a picture of Russian politics as a kind of Byzantine court, with all of these people with their new fortunes trying to get favors and influence decision-making by the immediate circle around Yeltsin.

ARABLOUEI: This is Steve Sestanovich. He's a professor at Columbia University and was a top official in the U.S. State Department during the Clinton administration.

ABDELFATAH: Now, I'm sure you're wondering where Putin ended up in all this chaos. And the truth is, it left him sort of disoriented. He'd been forced to move back to Russia with his young family after the Berlin Wall fell. His job with the KGB no longer existed because the KGB no longer existed; it went down with the Soviet Union. So his career plans were completely derailed.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: Eventually, though, Putin caught a break. He got a job in his hometown, St. Petersburg, as an adviser to one of his former law professors and mentors, Anatoly Sobchak. By that point, Sobchak had left the university to become mayor of St. Petersburg, and Sobchak, deciding to take a chance on Putin, appointed him deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. This was Putin's training ground. It's where he learned how to play the game of Russian politics, and he made it very clear he had higher ambitions than just running things behind the scenes in St. Petersburg.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, "POWER")

PUTIN: (Non-English language spoken).

ARABLOUEI: This is a clip from the 1992 documentary that Putin commissioned about himself. It's called "Power." And in this scene, Putin is driving, his eyes visible in the rearview mirror, snow covered trees pass by outside of his window. And then, he makes a bold admission - that he was formerly a member of the KGB, which wasn't very popular for a lot of people at the time. It was kind of a symbol of Russia's dark past.

ABDELFATAH: But for Sobchak, that was exactly why he wanted Putin on his team.

ANDREW MEIER: There are photographs, there are reminiscences, recollections of people who say that Putin had the desk right in front of Sobchak. And so Sobchak, I think it's pretty clear, wanted him there in a position of kind of a minder, gatekeeper, monitoring, keeping an eye on who was coming in, who was going out. There were a lot of skills that Putin's particular resume offered to Sobchak at the time.

ABDELFATAH: Skills like being a stealthy observer, operating in the shadows. Andrew Meier told us a story about Putin that he heard from an American diplomat, back when Meier was Moscow correspondent for Time magazine in the 1990s.

MEIER: He was always the guy at the reception, in the corner, often silent, not drinking - he's famous for not drinking - and taking note, observing. And he said we called him the ghost because he was always present but never really visible.

ARABLOUEI: Now, to really understand Putin's rise to power, we have to understand the dynamics between his boss, Sobchak, and Yeltsin, who, remember, at this time, is the president of Russia.

ABDELFATAH: It's a dramatic tale of two rivals who couldn't have been more different.

MEIER: Yeltsin was kind of the big, bearish, often clownish buffoon who would love to obviously drink shots with you and was the king of bluster. Sobchak was everything the opposite - very measured and someone, really, that the West and especially government officials, lawyers, business people could appreciate.

ABDELFATAH: Yeltsin began to feel threatened by Sobchak, who wasn't the yes man he wanted. Plus, Yeltsin worried that Sobchak was becoming a potential opposition candidate, might mess up his chances for re-election.

MEIER: And the Sobchak-Yeltsin relationship ballooned into an outright rivalry.

ARABLOUEI: To test Sobchak's loyalty, Yeltsin summoned him to his office to ask him about re-election.

MEIER: And he very simply says, you know, what do you think? Do you think I should run? And Sobchak, of course, gives the wrong answer.

ABDELFATAH: What does he say?

MEIER: That, I'm not sure that this is time. You should think about, you know, taking it easy. Maybe it's time to step down. Maybe it's time to think about your health. Maybe it's time to think about your family. And those were the last words that Yeltsin wanted to hear.

ARABLOUEI: Sobchak had failed the test. And at that point, Yeltsin basically declared war on him.

MEIER: It began with legal cases. It began with a lot of yellow journalism. He became a victim of tabloids. Highly sensationalist charges flew almost daily. It was a drip-drip-drip torture on Sobchak.

ARABLOUEI: Sobchak's name was mired in months of scandal. His reputation was in tatters. And so when it came to his re-election bid for mayor of St. Petersburg, he lost.

ABDELFATAH: Humiliated and facing a bunch of criminal investigations that may or may not have been politically motivated and could land him in prison, Sobchak was in serious trouble. But then, one day, in the middle of all this chaos, Sobchak, a man forbidden from leaving the country, shows up in Paris.

MEIER: In those days, this was not something easy to pull off - that a man who was officially wanted by Russian intelligence, Russian law enforcement, his own political rivals - that he could just end up in Paris.

ABDELFATAH: But Sobchak had someone with special skills on his side.

MEIER: Putin orchestrated this sort of fantastic escape. He hired or arranged to hire through an intermediary a private jet from Finland, brings it across into Russian airspace, gets Sobchak on the plane. Somehow, they get across to Paris. And it's only then when Sobchak lands in Paris that the world finds out.

ABDELFATAH: Putin had basically done the impossible, and in the process, proved just how clever and loyal he could be.

ARABLOUEI: And this event landed Putin on Yeltsin's radar. Eventually, Yeltsin became so impressed with Putin that he gave him a position in his government.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: But wait. This is kind of strange, right? Like, why would Yeltsin choose to hire the guy who was his rival - Sobchak's - protege?

MEIER: Well, there were a couple of things. I mean, one is it didn't matter that Yeltsin was behind the campaign to doom him. The fact that Putin came sort of riding in on the white horse to rescue him is what resonated loudest in Yeltsin's mind.

ARABLOUEI: Did he think, maybe he'll do this for me one day, because, you know, Yeltsin's government was super corrupt, and he was quickly making enemies, losing popularity?

MEIER: Yeah. There's no question that everyone at the time, remembering the Sobchak rescue, and at the same time, Yeltsin, not only physically infirm, but all kinds of legal questions surrounding his own regime - the threat not just of kind of a legal nightmare haunting Yeltsin, but even maybe something worse - something like a coup against him. Clearly, the premium was on loyalty, and Putin was the man who had that greatest experience showing loyalty.

ARABLOUEI: In a way, he was just kind of in the right place at the right time. I mean, it doesn't even feel like he's a main character in his own story at this point.

ABDELFATAH: Yeah. It's like an accident of history or something.

ARABLOUEI: Right.

ABDELFATAH: Like, his former mentor happened to become the mayor of St. Petersburg. He happened to appoint him deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. And ironically, when Sobchak fled, Yeltsin took an interest in him.

ARABLOUEI: And he's lucky that Yeltsin even reacted that way. In fact, things keep getting better for Putin. Not long after Putin makes it to Moscow, he's appointed the head of the new intelligence service in Russia, the FSB.

ABDELFATAH: Also known as Federal'naya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti Rossiyskoi Federatsii (ph). The FSB's role - well, it's not all that different from the KGB, which, remember, Putin had been a part of for a long time. So he was returning to very familiar territory.

ARABLOUEI: And as the head of the FSB, Putin began his stunning ascent to power.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARABLOUEI: Part 2 - Putin wags the dog.

ABDELFATAH: The year is 1999. Boris Yeltsin has been ruling over Russia for the last seven years or so. But his health is failing. He's just barely won re-election, recently faced impeachment, and he's alienated his parliament and government. He realizes he can't hold on to power for long, but he also knows just how much his government has stolen from the Russian people.

ABDELFATAH: And he's worried that the next president will try to hold him and his, quote, unquote, "family" accountable, so he needs to find a successor who he can trust.

ARABLOUEI: And who better than a guy who just a few years earlier took extreme measures to cover up for his boss?

ABDELFATAH: And so Yeltsin picks Putin out of relative obscurity to be Russia's next prime minister, hoping that if all goes according to plan...

ARABLOUEI: And that's a big if.

ABDELFATAH: ...He might become the next president.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

LUCAS: Putin was really, I think, the last desperate throw of the dice by the Yeltsin family because they were facing impeachment. The Duma, the Russian parliament, was really fed up with the way the country had been run and the corruption of the Yeltsin inner circle.

ABDELFATAH: Again, Edward Lucas.

LUCAS: So they were really going after him. And, you know, they tasted blood already. And so I think what happened was that the Yeltsin family turned to Putin, as a former KGB guy, and said, can you fix this?

ARABLOUEI: But they still had a problem. Russia was a democracy, and so Putin had to be legitimately elected as president. And at that point, pretty much no one inside Russia or outside Russia saw him as a potential world leader. I mean, people in the U.S. State Department could barely believe he had even been chosen as prime minister in the first place.

SESTANOVICH: I remember getting a call in the early morning from the State Department telling me that this had been President Yeltsin's choice. And, you know, I laughed out loud. The idea that this seeming nobody could be appointed prime minister of the Russian Federation was astonishing to me and my colleagues. But one thing we were pretty sure of was this guy wasn't going to last.

ABDELFATAH: At this point, that skepticism made sense. For outsiders, Putin's rise came out of nowhere, and it didn't seem like he'd last. Steve Sestanovich told us about the first time he met Putin when he was working in the State Department during the Clinton years.

SESTANOVICH: He was then very new on the job. He was very unsure of himself, hesitant but ingratiating. He obviously wanted to make a good impression on the president of the United States. He was clearly very conscious of being not only a newcomer to high politics, but much shorter than Bill Clinton. You could tell just the physical presence of Clinton made him somewhat uncomfortable.

ARABLOUEI: And what did Clinton think of him?

SESTANOVICH: I mean, Clinton afterwards said he liked him. He said, he's so Russian. I remember being a little surprised by this because I could tell what Putin was trying to do was not seem Russian. He was trying to seem German - competent, impressive, professional - in contrast to Yeltsin, whom Clinton was used to dealing with.

I also told Madeleine Albright after the meeting that he seemed to me a little rodent-like - you know, a small animal with a big, nervous, beating heart. But, you know, the next time we saw him...

ABDELFATAH: The next time they saw him - well, we'll get to that.

ARABLOUEI: Let's just say he doesn't seem rodent-like for long.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: See, the thing that most people didn't realize at the time was that Yeltsin and Putin were willing to do anything to get him elected.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #8: It's a devastating scene. The whole midsection of the building is gone. All that's left in some apartments are decorative rugs on the walls.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #9: There has been much speculation that the explosion was not an accident.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #10: Death toll.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #11: Deliberate bombing.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #12: Terrorists in Russia.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #13: Security forces are searching for all the suspects...

ABDELFATAH: A series of bombs go off in apartment buildings across Moscow.

YURI FELSHTINSKY: Then there was apartment bombings in a couple other cities. But, of course, Moscow was the most important one because 200-plus people were killed.

ABDELFATAH: And more than a thousand were injured.

FELSHTINSKY: Yes, hi. This is Yuri Felshtinsky. I'm a historian. I was born in Russia, moved to the United States.

ABDELFATAH: And Yuri was immediately suspicious of the Russian government's explanation about who was behind the bombings.

FELSHTINSKY: Now, the government claims that this was done by Chechen terrorists, which was very easy for people to believe because...

ABDELFATAH: Because it wouldn't have been the first time. Just a few years earlier, Chechens declared independence, and Russia invaded Chechnya in response in what became the First Chechen War. The result - hundreds of thousands of Chechens were either killed or left displaced.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARABLOUEI: But after the 1999 bombings take place, it wasn't as easy to blame the Chechens because something strange happened.

FELSHTINSKY: In a town not far from Moscow, terrorists were arrested when they were trying to put explosives into the basement of one of the apartment houses. And this was immediately broadcast by all major news stations in Russia. And when militia tried to investigate who those people are, they found out that they're officers of the FSB.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FELSHTINSKY: And at that moment, the central FSB office in Moscow made a statement that those people were not terrorists, and indeed, this was an exercise conducted by the government. It's the same day, 23 of September, the Russian government started to bomb Grozny and actually started the Second Chechen War - the same day.

ARABLOUEI: And at that point, Yuri had seen enough. So he hopped on a plane to Russia to start investigating in person.

FELSHTINSKY: Well, first off, not a single person knew about this. I had done this completely alone in absolute secrecy. And I met many different people. Some of them happened to be former KGB officers.

ARABLOUEI: He started to suspect that something big was going on, that maybe Yeltsin and Putin saw political opportunity in all this. His theory was that Yeltsin, Putin and the FSB were all conspiring to get Putin elected by manufacturing a war. Because, remember, it was going to be really difficult to get Putin elected, so they needed a way to make him look heroic and presidential. So Yuri thought that it was the FSB who planted the bombs in those apartment buildings, and that Yeltsin and Putin used the fallout as an excuse to start a second war with the Chechens.

ABDELFATAH: Yuri eventually concluded that the FSB had perpetrated more than one terror attack in Russia under Vladimir Putin's direct orders. All of this is detailed in the book he co-authored with Litvinenko, called "Blowing Up Russia."

ARABLOUEI: And we should be clear, there are some experts who dispute some of the specifics of Putin's alleged role in the bombings. But what's also true is that Putin has never denied any of the claims in the book. And the fact remains that, in the spring of 2000, Putin was elected to his first term as president of Russia.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: Part 3 - Go hard like Vladimir Putin.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GO HARD LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN")

AMG: (Singing) I go hard like Vladimir Putin. Go hard like Vladimir Putin.

ABDELFATAH: So this is a real song by a rap duo called AMG, and they're not who you might think of when you hear the words Russian nationalists - two expats from Zimbabwe and Kenya who moved to Moscow to study medicine in the early 2000s.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "GO HARD LIKE VLADIMIR PUTIN")

AMG: (Singing) Vladimir Putin - Vladimir. Vladimir Putin - Putin.

ABDELFATAH: And the music video is the best part. It features a bunch of slo-mo videos with Putin coming out of SUVs...

ARABLOUEI: Walking down a hallway full of armed guards...

ABDELFATAH: ...Shaking hands with people.

ARABLOUEI: There are tanks rolling down the street, things on fire, soldiers in combat.

ABDELFATAH: Makes Putin look like a real tough guy.

ARABLOUEI: And that perception is everything to Putin. So it's no surprise that when he got real power, he set out to get rid of any doubts he was fit to rule. No one would think of him as rodent-like anymore.

PETER POMERANTSEV: The first thing that Vladimir Putin does when he sort of takes power in 1999, 2000 is take control of TV.

ABDELFATAH: This is Peter Pomerantz. He's a Russian-born British journalist who actually has a pretty unique perspective. He worked as a TV producer in Russia in the 2000s.

POMERANTSEV: And it was really, by creating him into this sort of macho superhero on television and launching a small, very, very deadly war in Chechnya, he went from being the Moth, which apparently was his nickname in the security services, to being kind of, you know, a mixture of Donald Trump and Sly Stallone and all of them rolled into one.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ABDELFATAH: And his assertions of power through staged TV scenes and those over-the-top pictures we mentioned earlier - well, they began at home.

POMERANTSEV: So there would be bizarre scenes once a week where he would sort of confront his own government, saying, you're doing a really bad job, you know. He would kind of act the gangster boss in these scenes, you know. He'd sit at the end of a long table, like Lucy Liu in - what's it called again?

ABDELFATAH: "Kill Bill."

POMERANTSEV: And Don Corleone in "Godfather." And he sits at the end - Putin sits at the end, it's a long table - say, hey, you know, I see you've got a problem with, you know, with your ambulances. You know, we can find another governor.

ABDELFATAH: Or, I see you've got an unresolved labor dispute. Remember that story about the pen we opened with?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PUTIN: (Non-English language spoken).

ABDELFATAH: That's basically what Putin was doing there - flexing his muscles.

POMERANTSEV: And a lot of people say Putin is a Mafia Don - I mean, sort of. He knows how to work with the Mafia. But it's much more a case of him imitating that behavior because Russians respect gangsters because gangsters had been, you know, the heroes of the 1990s. They're the ones with the money and the women.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MEIER: It's pretty extraordinary - I mean, to me, just judging by my reporter's eye and ear - how he's grown over these years.

ARABLOUEI: Again, Andrew Meier.

MEIER: ...From, you know, a middling former lieutenant colonel in the KGB to the man, you know, atop the Kremlin for all these years. It's an extraordinary evolution.

ARABLOUEI: And that's exactly the point. Putin's rise was epic. He went from a nobody in the early 1990s to the country's president by the end of the decade. And he has a story that may be embellished in the media. I mean, he controls it, but still, it's astonishing. And it's a story that resonates with a lot of Russians.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PUTIN: (Speaking Russian).

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ARABLOUEI: That's it for this week's show. I'm Ramtin Arablouei.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Last week, Vladimir Putin was onstage
giving his annual State of the Nation address.
He proposed a few constitutional changes.
Give lots of new powers
to a previously minor state council,
give more power to parliament to choose cabinet ministers,
close the loophole that allows a president
to serve for more than two terms
as long as they're not consecutive.
And each of these proposals on their own
might sound fairly moderate.
But the Russian prime minister,
who was once actually a close Putin ally,
immediately resigned, taking his entire cabinet with him.
And that's shocking news, even for Russia.
That's because these proposals taken together
are not moderate tweaks.
They actually pave a way for Vladimir Putin
to continue to run the country, maybe for life.
So we at Planet Money thought
now would be an excellent time
to rebroadcast an episode
on the early years of Vladimir Putin.
It's by our friends at NPR's history podcast, Thru Line.
Here it is.
Okay, we're going to take you back to 2009 for a minute,
to a meeting between President Vladimir Putin
and a bunch of wealthy Russian factory owners.
Now, just imagine the scene.
Putin, whose voice we're hearing,
is sitting at the head
of a long rectangular conference table.
He's got on jeans and a windbreaker,
and guys in suits are sitting around that table,
hanging on his every word.
And the Russian press is there to capture it all.
Putin is asking the group,
why haven't you fixed this labor dispute yet?
You were running around, and I quote,
like cockroaches before I came.
And it's no accident that he's dragging them
through the mud in front of the Russian press.
This is a publicity stunt.
So after scolding them like children,
Putin makes them all sign a contract
ordering them to reopen their factories.
And he picks out one particular factory owner,
who, again, no accident,
is a prominent Russian billionaire,
whose name, by the way,
has come up several times in the Mueller investigation,
Oleg Deripauska.
Did everyone sign this?
Deripauska, have you signed?
Yes, I have signed.
Still, Putin makes Deripauska get up out of his seat,
walk all the way around the table,
and sign the contract again.
And as Deripauska walks away, Putin says,
Give me back my pen.
And makes Deripauska walk all the way back over
to hand it to him.
Hey, I'm Rhonda Abdel Fattah.
I'm Ram Tinera Blui.
And on this episode,
Decoding the Power of Vladimir Putin.
So that video we opened with,
it honestly felt like I was watching a scene
from a mobster movie.
Yeah, I mean, Putin pretty much cast himself
as a mob boss in that meeting.
Like, he's really trying hard
to portray himself as a tough guy.
So that got us thinking.
How did Russia come to be run by this guy,
Vladimir Putin?
Today, when you say Russia,
you might as well be saying Putin,
because he's been running the country
for nearly 20 years.
And on the one hand,
you have this over-the-top image of Putin.
The mob boss, the guy who rides shirtless
on horseback, or scuba dives for ancient treasures.
That, of course, he always finds.
And all of this is designed
to make him seem unstoppable.
So these images of Putin that we see,
how did they come to be?
And how do they help him maintain power?
To answer those questions,
we have to understand how he became
the person we see today.
Kind of like a ghost of Christmas past
for Vladimir Putin.
Exactly.
There's an international escape
in St. Petersburg.
A bombing conspiracy.
And a reality TV makeover.

Part One, The Great Escape.
We're gonna start this story
where Vladimir Putin's career began.
In the Soviet Union's notorious intelligence service,
the KGB.
Putin started off as a rather junior
and probably not very successful KGB officer.
This is Edward Lucas.
He worked for The Economist
and was their Moscow bureau chief from 1998 to 2002.
So Putin, fresh out of law school,
was recruited to join the KGB way back in 1975.
Not a lot is known about that time in his life,
but what we do know is that in 1985,
he was assigned to a post
in a city in East Germany called Dresden.
Which was a bit of a backwater.
And that meant he was too far
from the capital, Berlin,
to experience all the exciting spy games
that were playing out there
during the height of the Cold War.
And it's not clear that he ever ran any agents
or conducted any real espionage operations.
There's some suggestion that his main job
was to be in counterintelligence.
His job was checking up on other people,
which is a sort of necessary,
but often rather unpopular job
in intelligence agencies.
Putin spent five years in Dresden
and a total of 16 years in the KGB,
all the while slowly working his way up the ladder,
doing the jobs necessary to get ahead.
But then, in 1991,
the world came crashing down around him.
Just months after an attempted coup,
Mikhail Gorbachev resigned from his position
as president of the Soviet Union,
effectively bringing it to an end.
It was a different tide rushing down the beach,
and you could then see the kind of
stony outcrops of real power.
Suddenly, the country went from having
a centralized communist economy
to something that was more privatized.
It was a wildly unstable time for everyone in Russia.
A free market emerged
that was poorly managed
and a breeding ground for corruption.
Mobsters and other criminals
took advantage of the instability,
and Russia's massive wealth
was picked off by a few at the top.
Amid all that,
a new leader came to power in Russia.
His name?
Boris Yeltsin.
He tried to stabilize the Russian economy,
but his methods were pretty shady.
Yeltsin's government more or less acted
like the mafia.
You do me a favor, I owe you.
Return a favor later, et cetera.
Good old-fashioned corruption.
Increasingly, in the 90s,
there was a picture of Russian politics
as a kind of Byzantine court.
With all of these people with their new fortunes
trying to get favors and influence decision-making
by the immediate circle around Yeltsin.
This is Steve Sestanovich.
He's a professor at Columbia University
and was a top official in the US State Department
during the Clinton administration.
Now, I'm sure you're wondering
where Putin ended up in all this chaos.
And the truth is, it left him sort of disoriented.
He'd been forced to move back to Russia
with his young family after the Berlin Wall fell.
His job with the KGB no longer existed
because the KGB no longer existed.
It went down with the Soviet Union.
So his career plans were completely derailed.
Eventually though, Putin caught a break.
He got a job in his hometown, St. Petersburg,
as an advisor to one of his former law professors
and mentors, Anatoly Sobchak.
By that point, Sobchak had left the university
to become mayor of St. Petersburg.
And Sobchak, deciding to take a chance on Putin,
appointed him deputy mayor of St. Petersburg.
This was Putin's training ground.
It's where he learned how to play the game
of Russian politics.
And he made it very clear he had higher ambitions
than just running things behind the scenes
in St. Petersburg.
After graduation, I was offered to come to work.
This is a clip from the 1992 documentary
that Putin commissioned about himself.
It's called Power.
And in this scene, Putin is driving,
his eyes visible in the rear-view mirror,
snow-covered trees passed by outside of his window.
And then he makes a bold admission
that he was formerly a member of the KGB,
which wasn't very popular for a lot of people
at the time.
It was kind of a symbol of Russia's dark past.
But for Sobchak, that was exactly
why he wanted Putin on his team.
There are photographs, there are reminiscences,
recollections of people who say
that Putin had the desk right in front of Sobchak.
And so Sobchak, I think it's pretty clear,
wanted him there in a position of kind of a minder,
gatekeeper, monitoring, keeping an eye
on who was coming in, who was going out.
There were a lot of skills
that Putin's particular resume offered
to Sobchak at the time.
Skills like being a stealthy observer,
operating in the shadows.
Andrew Meyer told us a story about Putin
that he heard from an American diplomat
back when Meyer was Moscow correspondent
for Time Magazine in the 1990s.
He was always the guy at the reception,
in the corner, often silent, not drinking,
he's famous for not drinking,
and taking note, observing.
And he said we called him the ghost
because he was always present but never really visible.
Not to really understand Putin's rise to power,
we have to understand the dynamics
between his boss, Sobchak, and Yeltsin,
who remember at this time is the president of Russia.
It's a dramatic tale of two rivals
who couldn't have been more different.
Yeltsin was kind of the big bearish,
often clownish buffoon
who would love to obviously drink shots with you
and was the king of bluster.
Sobchak was everything the opposite.
Very measured and someone really that the West,
and especially government officials,
lawyers, business people, could appreciate.
Yeltsin began to feel threatened by Sobchak,
who wasn't the yes man he wanted.
Plus, Yeltsin worried that Sobchak
was becoming a potential opposition candidate
who might mess up his chances for re-election.
And the Sobchak-Yeltsin relationship
bloomed into an outright rivalry.
To test Sobchak's loyalty,
Yeltsin summoned him to his office
to ask him about re-election.
And he very simply says,
what do you think, do you think I should run?
And Sobchak, of course, gives the wrong answer.
What does he say?
That I'm not sure that this is time
you should think about taking it easy.
Maybe it's time to step down.
Maybe it's time to think about your health.
Maybe it's time to think about your family.
And those were the last words that Yeltsin wanted to hear.
Sobchak had failed the test.
And at that point,
Yeltsin basically declared war on him.
It began with legal cases.
It began with a lot of yellow journalism.
He became a victim of tabloid,
highly sensationalist.
Charges flew almost daily.
It was a drip, drip, drip torture on Sobchak.
Sobchak's name was mired in months of scandal.
His reputation was in tatters.
And so when it came to his re-election bid
for mayor of St. Petersburg, he lost.
Humiliated and facing a bunch of criminal investigations
that may or may not have been politically motivated
and could land him in prison,
Sobchak was in serious trouble.
But then, one day, in the middle of all this chaos,
Sobchak, a man forbidden from leaving the country,
shows up in Paris.
In those days, this was not something easy to pull off.
That a man who was officially wanted
by Russian intelligence, Russian law enforcement,
his own political rivals,
that he could just end up in Paris.
But Sobchak had someone with special skills on his side.
Putin orchestrated this sort of fantastic escape.
He hired or arranged to hire through an intermediary
a private jet from Finland,
brings it across into Russian airspace,
gets Sobchak on the plane,
somehow they get across to Paris,
and it's only then when Sobchak lands in Paris
that the world finds out.
Putin had basically done the impossible,
and in the process, proved just how clever
and loyal he could be.
And this event landed Putin on Yeltsin's radar.
Eventually, Yeltsin became so impressed with Putin
that he gave him a position in his government.
But wait, this is kind of strange, right?
Like, why would Yeltsin choose to hire
the guy who was his rival, Sobchak's protege?
Well, there were a couple of things.
I mean, one is it didn't matter
that Yeltsin was behind the campaign to doom him.
The fact that Putin came sort of riding in
on the white horse to rescue him
is what resonated loudest in Yeltsin's mind.
Did he think maybe he'll do this for me one day?
Because, you know, Yeltsin's government was super corrupt
and he was quickly making enemies, losing popularity.
Yeah, there's no question that everyone at the time
remembering the Sobchak rescue.
And at the same time, Yeltsin, not only physically infirm,
but all kinds of legal questions surrounding his own regime,
the threat, not just of kind of a legal nightmare
haunting Yeltsin, but even maybe something worse,
something like a coup against him.
Clearly, the premium was on loyalty
and Putin was the man who had that greatest experience
showing loyalty.
In a way, he was just kind of in the right place
at the right time.
I mean, it doesn't even feel like he's a main character
in his own story at this point.
Yeah, he's like an accident of history or something.
Like his former mentor happened to become
the mayor of St. Petersburg.
He happened to appoint him
deputy mayor of St. Petersburg.
And ironically, when Sobchak fled,
Yeltsin took an interest in him.
And he's lucky that Yeltsin even reacted that way.
In fact, things keep getting better for Putin.
Not long after Putin makes it to Moscow,
he's appointed the head
of the new intelligence service in Russia,
also known as Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti Rosyoskoyi Federatsi.
The FSB's role?
Well, it's not all that different from the KGB,
which remember Putin had been a part of for a long time.
So he was returning to very familiar territory.
And as the head of the FSB,
Putin began his stunning ascent to power.

Part Two, Putin Wags the Dog.
The year is 1999.
Boris Yeltsin has been ruling over Russia
for the last seven years or so,
but his health is failing.
He's just barely won reelection,
recently faced impeachment,
and he's alienated his parliament and government.
He realizes he can't hold onto power for long,
but he also knows just how much his government
has stolen from the Russian people.
And he's worried that the next president
will try to hold him
and his quote unquote family accountable.
So he needs to find a successor who he can trust.
And who better than a guy
who just a few years earlier
took extreme measures to cover up for his boss.
And so Yeltsin picks Putin at a relative obscurity
to be Russia's next prime minister,
hoping that if all goes according to plan,
and that's a big if,
he might become the next president.
Putin was really, I think,
the last desperate throw of the dice
by the Yeltsin family,
because they were facing impeachment.
The Duma, the Russian parliament,
was really fed up with the way the country had been run
and the corruption of the Yeltsin inner circle.
Again, Edward Lucas.
So they were really going after him,
and they tasted blood already.
And so I think what happened
was that the Yeltsin family turned to Putin
as a former KGB guy and said,
can you fix this?
But they still had a problem.
Russia was a democracy.
And so Putin had to be legitimately elected as president.
And at that point,
pretty much no one inside Russia or outside Russia
saw him as a potential world leader.
I mean, people in the US State Department
could barely believe he had even been chosen
as prime minister in the first place.
I remember getting a call in the early morning
from the State Department,
telling me that this had been President Yeltsin's choice.
And I laughed out loud.
I mean, the idea that this seeming nobody
could be appointed prime minister
of the Russian Federation
was astonishing to me and my colleagues.
But one thing we were pretty sure of
was this guy wasn't gonna last.
At this point, that skepticism made sense.
For outsiders, Putin's rise came out of nowhere,
and it didn't seem like he'd last.
Steve Sosanovic told us
about the first time he met Putin
when he was working in the State Department
during the Clinton years.
He was then very new on the job.
He was very unsure of himself,
hesitant, but ingratiating.
He obviously wanted to make a good impression
on the President of the United States.
He was clearly very conscious
of being not only a newcomer to high politics,
but much shorter than Bill Clinton.
And you could tell just the physical presence
of Clinton made him somewhat uncomfortable.
And what did Clinton think of him?
I mean, Clinton afterwards said he liked him.
He said he's so Russian.
And I remember being a little surprised by this
because I could tell what Putin was trying to do
was not seem Russian.
He was trying to seem German,
competent, impressive, professional,
in contrast to Yeltsin,
whom Clinton was used to dealing with.
I also told Madeleine Albright after the meeting
that he seemed to me a little rodent-like,
a small animal with a big nervous beating heart.
But the next time we saw him-
The next time they saw him?
Well, we'll get to that.
Let's just say he doesn't seem rodent-like for long.
See, the thing that most people
didn't realize at the time
was that Yeltsin and Putin
were willing to do anything to get him elected.
It's a devastating scene.
The whole midsection of the building is gone.
All that's left of some apartments
are decorative rugs on the wall of a living room.
There has been much speculation
that the explosion was not an accident
but was a deliberate bombing of the state and city.
Terrorist attack in Russia.
Security forces are searching for all the suspects.
A baking plan has carried out the bombing.
Southern Russians.
A series of bombs go off
in apartment buildings across Moscow.
Then there was an apartment bombing
in a couple of other cities,
but of course, Moscow was the most important one
because 200-plus people were killed.
And more than 1,000 were injured.
Yes, hi.
This is Yuri Felchdinsky.
I'm a historian.
I was born in Russia, moved to the United States.
And Yuri was immediately suspicious
of the Russian government's explanation
about who was behind the bombings.
Now, the government claims
that this was done by Chechen terrorists.
What was very easy for people to believe because...
Because it wouldn't have been the first time.
Just a few years earlier, Chechens declared independence
and Russia invaded Chechnya in response
in what became the first Chechen war.
The result, hundreds of thousands of Chechens
were either killed or left displaced.
But after the 1999 bombings take place,
it wasn't as easy to blame the Chechens
because something strange happens.
In a town not far from Moscow,
terrorists were arrested when they were trying
to put explosives into the basement
of one of the apartment houses.
And this was immediately broadcasted
by all major news stations in Russia.
And when militia tried to investigate
who those people are,
they found out that they're officers of the FSB.
And at that moment,
the central FSB office in Moscow made a statement
that those people were not terrorists.
And indeed, this was an exercise conducted
by the government.
It's the same day, 23rd of September,
the Russian government started to bomb Grozny
and actually started the second Chechen war,
the same day.
And at that point, Yuri had seen enough.
So he hopped on a plane to Russia
to start investigating in person.
Well, first of all,
not a single person knew about this.
I've done this completely alone in absolute secrecy.
And I met many different people.
Some of them happened to be former KGB officers.
He started to suspect that something big was going on,
that maybe Yeltsin and Putin saw political opportunity
in all this.
His theory was that Yeltsin, Putin, and the FSB
were all conspiring to get Putin elected
by manufacturing a war.
Because remember,
it was gonna be really difficult to get Putin elected.
And so they needed a way to make him look heroic
and presidential.
So Yuri thought that it was the FSB
who planted the bombs in those apartment buildings
and that Yeltsin and Putin used the fallout
as an excuse to start a second war with the Chechens.
Yuri eventually concluded that the FSB
had perpetrated more than one terror attack in Russia
under Vladimir Putin's direct orders.
All of this is detailed in the book he co-authored
called Blowing Up Russia.
And we should be clear,
there are some experts who dispute some of the specifics
of Putin's alleged role in the bombings.
But what's also true is that Putin has never denied
any of the claims in the book.
And the fact remains that in the spring of 2000,
Putin was elected to his first term
as president of Russia.
Part three, Go Hard Like Vladimir Putin.
I go hard like Vladimir Putin.
Go hard like Vladimir Putin.
So this is a real song by a rap duo called AMG.
And they're not who you might think of
when you hear the words Russian nationalist.
Two ex-past from Zimbabwe and Kenya
who moved to Moscow to study medicine
in the early 2000s.
And the music video is the best part.
It features a bunch of slow-mo videos
with Putin coming out of SUVs.
Walking down a hallway full of armed guards.
Shaking hands with people.
There are tanks rolling down the street,
things on fire, soldiers in combat.
It makes Putin look like a real tough guy.
And that perception is everything to Putin.
So it's no surprise that when he got real power,
he set out to get rid of any doubts he was fit to rule.
No one would think of him as rodent-like anymore.
The first thing that Vladimir Putin does
when he sort of takes power in 1999, 2000,
is take control of TV.
This is Peter Pomerantsev.
He's a Russian-born British journalist
who actually has a pretty unique perspective.
He worked as a TV producer in Russia in the 2000s.
And it was really by creating him
into this sort of macho superhero on television
and launching a small, very, very deadly war in Chechnya.
He went from being the Moth,
which apparently was his nickname,
in the security services,
to being kind of, you know,
a mixture of Donald Trump and Sly Stallone
and all of them rolled into one.
And his assertions of power through stage TV scenes
and those over-the-top pictures we mentioned earlier,
well, they began at home.
So there would be bizarre scenes once a week
where he would sort of confront his own government,
saying, you're doing a really bad job, you know.
He would kind of act the gangster boss in these scenes,
you know, he would sit at the end of a long table,
like Lucy Liu in, what's it called again?
Kill Bill.
Don Colioni in Godfather,
and he sits at the end,
Putin sits at the end of this long table,
saying, hey, you know,
I see you've got a problem with your ambulances,
you know, we can find another governor.
Or, I see you've got an unresolved labor dispute.
Remember that story about the pen we opened with?
That's basically what Putin was doing there,
flexing his muscles.
And a lot of people say Putin is a mafia don,
I mean, sort of.
He knows how to work with the mafia,
but it's much more a case of him imitating that behavior
because Russians respect gangsters
because gangsters had been, you know,
the heroes of the 1990s.
They're the ones with the money and the women.
It's pretty extraordinary.
I mean, to me, just as with my reporter's eye and ear,
how he's grown over these years.
Again, Andrew Meyer.
From, you know, a middling former lieutenant colonel
in the KGB to the man on top of the Kremlin
for all these years, it's an extraordinary evolution.
And that's exactly the point.
Putin's rise was epic.
He went from a nobody in the early 1990s
to the country's president by the end of the decade.
And he has a story that may be embellished in the media.
I mean, he controls it.
But still, it's astonishing.
It's a story that resonates with a lot of Russians.
Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.
