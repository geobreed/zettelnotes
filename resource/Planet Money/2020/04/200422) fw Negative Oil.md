UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

On Monday the price of a barrel of oil in the United States fell below zero. Specifically, it fell to negative $37 a barrel. People were paying other people to take oil off their hands.

MARY CHILDS, HOST:

This is not normal. It has never happened before, and until a few days ago, it didn't even seem possible.

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Mary Childs.

GOLDSTEIN: And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today on the show, what just happened to the price of oil and what it tells us about what's happening in the world right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDSTEIN: In the United States, when we talk about the price of oil, we don't mean really the price to buy a barrel of oil today. What we mean is the price of a contract to buy oil next month. Traders call next month the front month.

CHILDS: So that insane thing that happened a few days ago to the price of oil when it traded briefly at negative $37 per barrel like it was junk that needed to be hauled away - that was this contract. It's called the West Texas Intermediate Light Sweet Crude Oil or WTI for short.

GOLDSTEIN: Is there, like, specific language? Is it just like a little bit of reading like, I, so-and-so...

ED CROOKS: Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: ...Promise to deliver.

CROOKS: Yes.

GOLDSTEIN: Give me a little bit of that.

CROOKS: So let me, if I can - I mean, do you want to right now? Let's have a look.

CHILDS: This is Ed Crooks. He works at a consultancy - Wood Mackenzie - and he is PLANET MONEY's oil phone-a-friend.

CROOKS: It says as follows. Delivery shall be made free on board at any pipeline or storage facility in Cushing, Okla., with pipeline access to Enterprise Cushing Storage or Enbridge Cushing Storage. Those are two big pipeline and storage companies that operate there.

GOLDSTEIN: This contract says in particular that the seller has to deliver oil to the town of Cushing, Okla. You've got Google Earth up. I've got Google Earth up. We'll search Cushing, Okla.

CHILDS: There's a little reservoir. It's very pretty. Don't swim in it.

GOLDSTEIN: Basically, what you see is a town that looks like it is entirely made up of oil tanks, just all these round circles - oil tank, oil tank, oil tank. And in fact, each one of them is, like - you could put a 747 inside of it.

CHILDS: Very large above-ground swimming pools for oil. This particular contract, this promise to transfer 1,000 barrels of oil sometime next month in Cushing, Okla., is bought and sold by oil producers in Texas and by refineries in Louisiana as you might expect. But this contract is also bought and sold by pension funds in the Midwest and by governments in Asia and hedge funds in London, by people and institutions all around the world. Every single day, these people are promising to buy and sell each other millions of barrels of oil next month at a terminal in Cushing, Okla.

GOLDSTEIN: And yet, sort of strangely, almost none of these people expects to have anything to do with actual barrels of oil or with Cushing or, for that matter, with Oklahoma.

CROOKS: The one thing they really don't want to be doing is driving a truck to Cushing, Okla...

(LAUGHTER)

CROOKS: ...And filling it up with the oil that they get there. That's the last thing on their minds.

CHILDS: It's like there are two different kinds of oil - the actual black goo that comes out of the ground and a financial abstraction that people buy and sell to each other to hedge risk or to make bets. In normal times, those two kinds of oil get along just fine. We don't even notice. But obviously, this is not a normal time. And this week the relationship between those two kinds of oil blew up.

GOLDSTEIN: So the story of how this happened, how the whole thing blew up, how oil came to be worth less than nothing - it starts with the physical oil, the stuff we pump out of the ground and send to Cushing. And it starts last month in March, which, not coincidentally, Mary, was the last time you and I did a show about oil. That was that moment when the Russians and the Saudis decided, in the face of a collapsing economy and falling demand for oil, that they were going to start pumping more oil, not less.

CHILDS: Ernie Barsamian told us the story of what happened in March. He's the CEO of a company called The Tank Tiger, and his whole business is connecting people who have empty oil tanks with people who are looking for a place to store oil.

ERNIE BARSAMIAN: We're kind of match.com where we just kind of make the introduction and just get the heck out of the way.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. So there's people who are looking to store, oil and there's people who have places where oil can be stored. And you...

BARSAMIAN: Right.

GOLDSTEIN: ...Introduce those people to each other.

BARSAMIAN: Right. I'm the light that goes on in the back porch and the moths fly around it.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) OK.

CHILDS: So it's that weekend in March the Saudis and the Russians say that they're going to pump more oil, and the price of oil plunges.

BARSAMIAN: It was Sunday night. March 8 was the - probably the busiest day I've had in five years was on a Sunday night. You know, when they made the announcement and price dropped to $30 a barrel, you know, that immediately created a contango in the marketplace.

CHILDS: Contango.

GOLDSTEIN: Let's do contango. Let's explain contango.

CHILDS: I think that feels right.

GOLDSTEIN: So when Ernie says, as he said, that the price of oil dropped to $30 a barrel, he means the price of that one contract we were just talking about - right? - the contract to deliver 1,000 barrels of oil to Cushing, Okla., next month. It means you can pay $30 a barrel now to get 1,000 barrels next month, but this is not the only option available to you if you want to buy oil to be delivered in the future. You can buy oil for delivery two months from now or three months from now or four months from now, et cetera, et cetera, month by month, all the way out for years in the future.

So suddenly, on this day in March, you could buy oil for delivery next month for around $30 a barrel, but at the same moment, you could also buy oil for delivery in December of 2020 for around $35 a barrel. So this state of the world, when the price of oil several months in the future is higher than the price of oil to be delivered next month - that is contango.

CHILDS: Contango - oil in the distant future is more expensive than now-ish (ph) oil. And think about what that means. That means you can enter into a contract to buy oil in April for about $30 per barrel and, at the same time, enter into another contract to sell oil in December for $35 a barrel. That's free money. That's like $5 for free except for one small detail. You do have to figure out what to do with the oil between April and December, which is why everybody was calling Ernie that night in March.

BARSAMIAN: Yeah. They were saying, tell me about this storage. Is it available? Tell me. Where can you find this and that? So we were doing a lot of that on Sunday night, and we - you know, we booked up a fair amount of storage just on that night.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

BARSAMIAN: Basically, the big boys came in, and they got all the - you know, the storage in Cushing. They got all the storage in Houston which has access to refineries and all the major pipelines. So now that's all - then, you know, we're done. That week everything's taken out. Now it's like, OK, well, what's left? Well, you know, we got big, deep water tanks in Philadelphia, Baltimore, you know, Charleston, S.C., you know, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans, you know - places that people still like to go to but, you know, not...

GOLDSTEIN: Kind of second-tier.

BARSAMIAN: Yeah. Those terminals don't leap tall buildings in a single bound. They're not as interesting.

GOLDSTEIN: And so - wait. So just so I'm following the story - this is good. Those kind of second-tier places, that's, like - what? - the rest of March or something those are filling up?

BARSAMIAN: Yeah. We're doing - we're talking early April now.

GOLDSTEIN: OK. OK.

BARSAMIAN: And then...

GOLDSTEIN: Because the contango is getting bigger and bigger - right? - so people have more and more...

BARSAMIAN: It just keeps getting bigger. It's like Pac-Man. It feeds on itself. It just keeps going.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) OK.

BARSAMIAN: And...

GOLDSTEIN: I don't know if that's exactly how Pac-Man works, but I like it. Keep going.

BARSAMIAN: You're too young, man.

GOLDSTEIN: No. No, I'm not. I played Pac-Man. But does Pac-Man feed on itself?

BARSAMIAN: (Mimicking Pac-Man sound).

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, that's it. Very good.

BARSAMIAN: All right. So basically, now you - now the big boys are tired. They're like, hey; look. You know, we got all the storage we want. You know, and I stopped getting calls. I know they're done. They're kind of - they're sated.

CHILDS: By early April, the only storage left that you could book was very difficult to get to.

BARSAMIAN: So you got all these nooks and crannies. You got terminals, you know, basically all over the - you know, landlocked terminals, small tanks, you know, that are barge access only. You know, it's truck access, that kind of thing where it's going to cost you a lot more to get it there.

CHILDS: And by this week, a lot of those nooks and crannies had been booked up.

BARSAMIAN: After the break, there will be negative oil prices.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GOLDSTEIN: We are almost to this moment, aka Monday, when the price of oil for the first time in history goes to negative $37 a barrel. But there is one more very important thing we got to talk about before we get there, and this very important thing goes back to that world of purely financial oil, of oil as a hedge or as a bet, of oil as an abstraction on a computer screen.

CHILDS: The fact is this. The number of barrels of oil that people are promising to buy and sell at Cushing, Okla. in the future is much, much larger than the number of barrels that will actually be sold at Cushing, Okla.

GOLDSTEIN: So, for example, if you look right now at contracts for a few months out, for this summer, people are promising to deliver, like, something like a billion barrels of oil a month in Cushing this summer. But there is no way this is going to happen. Everybody knows it. In fact, the number of barrels of oil that people are promising to deliver is, like, 10 times as high as the actual number of barrels that are going to be delivered.

CHILDS: And in normal times, this is actually not a problem. Month after month, it's fine, and that's because financial oil people who have promised to buy oil but have no intention of actually buying any real oil get matched up with other financial oil people who have promised to sell oil but really have no intention of actually selling any oil. Some money changes hands, the bet is paid off, and the contract evaporates. It's just like in Candy Crush when the little candy pieces match each other and line up and they just go poof and they disappear like they never existed.

GOLDSTEIN: But there is this moment every month when the contract for the coming month expires - a deadline, a clear deadline. And this is the moment, the minute, the second, when this abstract financial bet on the price of oil turns into a promise to buy or sell 1,000 barrels of real, physical oil in Cushing, Okla., next month. This deadline is right there in the fine print Ed Crooks read to us.

CROOKS: Trading terminates three business days prior to the 25th calendar day of the month prior to the contract month.

GOLDSTEIN: This month, that meant yesterday. That meant Tuesday, April 21. If you were an investor who had no intention of taking delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil, you had to sell your contract by Tuesday.

CROOKS: On the day that it happens, it happens at half past 2 in the afternoon.

CHILDS: It's very fun. It feels very Cinderella.

CROOKS: I was - that's exactly the image I was using yesterday. As you say, the big thing is at the end of the night, your carriage turns into a pumpkin. And so you have to get out of the ball before that happens. You cannot be left sitting in a pumpkin when midnight strikes. So that's something that a lot of investors were facing.

GOLDSTEIN: And by pumpkin, you mean 1,000 barrels of oil and nowhere to put them.

CROOKS: Exactly that.

CHILDS: So in other words, as those investors are getting anxious to sell their contracts so they don't actually have to take delivery of oil, they rush to sell, and the price starts to fall. And here, the abstract investment oil world meets with the world of physical, real oil. People see the price falling, and they call Ernie at The Tank Tiger. And they say, hey, Ernie. I want to buy this contract, take delivery for the next month. Can you find me someplace to put the oil?

GOLDSTEIN: That is exactly what happened Monday when the price of oil was imploding.

BARSAMIAN: I had dozens of phone calls from, you know, financial institution-type hedge fund people. You know, can you find me storage? Can you find me storage - that kind of stuff.

GOLDSTEIN: And what did you say when they called?

BARSAMIAN: I said, I can't help you.

GOLDSTEIN: Why not?

BARSAMIAN: Well, though, I knew there was no storage. They wanted prompt storage. Everything that was going on yesterday, I was just kind of eating popcorn and watching.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter).

BARSAMIAN: It just wasn't - there wasn't any - I couldn't help anybody.

CHILDS: That is what happened. Some set of people or institutions in the financial world were trying to sell their abstract investment oil contracts before they suddenly magically turned into real, physical oil. And because there was nowhere to put the real, physical oil and the contract was about to expire, nobody wanted to buy it. When people are very desperate to sell and nobody wants to buy, the price of anything will fall very, very fast. And that is why the price of oil for delivery in Cushing in May briefly fell to negative $37 a barrel on Monday. By the time the contract actually expired on Tuesday afternoon, it had shot back up to the positive but still very, very low price of around $10.

GOLDSTEIN: And oil selling at $10 a barrel, according to Ed Crooks, is sending a pretty straightforward message about the state of the world.

CROOKS: The oil market is pointing to this very, very sharp decline in activity. It's saying, look outside. Look at the roads. Look at the stores. Look at the shopping malls. Look at the sky and the aircraft not flying. The downturn of activity has been colossal. And although the stock market's pulled back, it's not really reflecting the scale of the shock that we've had.

GOLDSTEIN: Also, Ed says, that moment on Monday - that moment when the oil market broke, when financial oil crashed into the physical world and the price went down and down and down - that moment is also sending us a message.

CROOKS: Our world in general has become phenomenally complex in terms of the physical world in terms of supply chains, where we get our food, where we get everything we need to live. It's also become phenomenally complex in the financial world, as we learned during the financial crisis. And what we saw during Monday was an example of one of those complexities leading to a very serious rupture, really having quite a fundamental breakdown. And you have to think, given the huge strain that we're putting our economy and our financial system under at the moment, there've got to be more of those out there. There's certainly going to be more things that we can't even imagine right now but we're going to be finding out about over the months to come.

CHILDS: Exciting.

CROOKS: (Laughter) Yeah. I look forward to it. Good news. Enjoy your weekend, everyone.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
On Monday, the price of a barrel of oil
in the United States fell below zero.
Specifically, it fell to negative $37 a barrel.
People were paying other people
to take oil off their hands.
This is not normal.
It has never happened before,
and until a few days ago, it didn't even seem possible.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Mary Childs.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today on the show, what just happened
to the price of oil and what it tells us
about what's happening in the world right now.
In the United States, when we talk about the price of oil,
we don't mean really the price
to buy a barrel of oil today.
What we mean is the price of a contract
to buy oil next month.
Traders call next month the front month.
So that insane thing that happened a few days ago
to the price of oil when it traded briefly
at negative $37 per barrel,
like it was junk that needed to be hauled away,
that was this contract.
It's called the West Texas Intermediate Light Sweet Crude Oil,
or WTI for short.
Is there like specific language?
It's just like a little bit of reading,
like I so-and-so promised to deliver.
Give me a little bit of that.
So let me, if I can, I mean,
do you want that right now?
Let's have a look.
This is Ed Crooks.
He works at a consultancy, Wood Mackenzie,
and he is Planet Money's oil phone-a-friend.
It says as follows,
delivery shall be made free on board
at any pipeline or storage facility
in Cushing, Oklahoma,
with pipeline access to enterprise Cushing storage
and bridge Cushing storage,
those two big pipeline and storage companies
that operate there.
This contract says in particular
that the seller has to deliver oil
to the town of Cushing, Oklahoma.
You got Google Earth up?
I've got Google Earth up.
I'm gonna search Cushing, Oklahoma.
There's a little reservoir.
It's very pretty.
Don't swim in it.
Basically what you see is a town that looks like
it is entirely made up of oil tanks,
just all these round circles,
oil tank, oil tank, oil tank.
And in fact, each one of them is like,
you could put a 747 inside of it.
Very large above-ground swimming pools for oil.
This particular contract,
this promise to transfer 1,000 barrels of oil
sometime next month in Cushing, Oklahoma,
is bought and sold by oil producers in Texas
and by refineries in Louisiana, as you might expect.
But this contract is also bought and sold
by pension funds in the Midwest
and by governments in Asia and hedge funds in London,
by people and institutions all around the world.
Every single day, these people are promising
to buy and sell each other millions of barrels of oil
next month at a terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma.
And yet, sort of strangely,
almost none of these people expects to have anything
to do with actual barrels of oil or with Cushing
or for that matter with Oklahoma.
The one thing they really don't want to be doing
is driving a truck to Cushing, Oklahoma
and filling it up with the oil that they get there.
That's the last thing on their minds.
It's like there are two different kinds of oil.
The actual black goo that comes out of the ground
and a financial abstraction
that people buy and sell to each other
to hedge risk or to make bets.
In normal times, those two kinds of oil
get along just fine.
We don't even notice.
But obviously, this is not a normal time.
And this week, the relationship
between those two kinds of oil blew up.
So the story of how this happened,
how the whole thing blew up,
how oil came to be worth less than nothing,
it starts with the physical oil,
the stuff we pump out of the ground and send to Cushing.
And it starts last month in March,
which not coincidentally, Mary,
it was the last time you and I did a show about oil.
That was that moment when the Russians
and the Saudis decided in the face
of a collapsing economy and falling demand for oil
that they were gonna start pumping more oil, not less.
Ernie Barsemian told us the story
of what happened in March.
He's the CEO of a company called The Tank Tiger.
And his whole business is connecting people
who have empty oil tanks
with people who are looking for a place to store oil.
We're kind of match.com,
where we just kind of make the introduction
and just get the heck out of the way.
Okay, so there's people who are looking to store oil
and there's people who have places
where oil can be stored
and you introduce those people to each other.
Right, I'm the light that goes on in the back porch
and the moths fly around it.
Okay.
So it's that weekend in March,
the Saudis and the Russians say
that they're going to pump more oil
and the price of oil plunges.
It was Sunday night, March 8th
was probably the busiest day I've had in five years
was on a Sunday night.
You know, when they made the announcement
and price dropped to $30 a barrel,
you know, that immediately created a contango
in the marketplace.
Contango.
Let's do contango.
Let's explain contango.
I think that feels right.
So when Ernie says, as he said,
that the price of oil dropped to $30 a barrel,
he means the price of that one contract
we were just talking about, right?
The contract to deliver a thousand barrels of oil
to Cushing, Oklahoma next month.
Means you can pay $30 a barrel now
to get a thousand barrels next month.
But this is not the only option available to you
if you want to buy oil to be delivered in the future.
You can buy oil for delivery two months from now
or three months from now or four months from now,
et cetera, et cetera, month by month,
all the way out for years in the future.
So suddenly on this day in March,
you could buy oil for delivery next month
for around $30 a barrel.
But at the same moment,
you could also buy oil for delivery in December of 2020
for around $35 a barrel.
So this state of the world,
when the price of oil several months in the future
is higher than the price of oil
to be delivered next month, that is contango.
Contango, oil in the distant future
is more expensive than nowish oil.
And think about what that means.
That means you can enter into a contract
to buy oil in April for about $30 per barrel
and at the same time enter into another contract
to sell oil in December for $35 a barrel.
That's free money.
That's like $5 for free,
except for one small detail.
You do have to figure out what to do with the oil
between April and December,
which is why everybody was calling Ernie
that night in March.
Yeah, they're saying,
tell me about this storage.
Is it available?
Tell me where can you find this and that?
So we were doing a lot of that on Sunday night.
And we booked up a fair amount of storage
just on that night.
Okay.
Basically the big boys came in.
They got all the storage in Cushing.
They got all the storage in Houston,
which has access to refineries
and all the major pipelines.
So now that's all, then we're done.
That week, everything's taken out.
Now it's like, okay, but what's left?
Well, we got big deep water tanks
in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, South Carolina,
Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans,
places that people still like to go to,
but not-
Kind of second tier.
Yeah, those terminals don't leave tall buildings
in a single bound.
They're not as interesting.
And so wait, so just so I'm following the story,
this is good.
Those kind of second tier places,
that's like what, the rest of March or something?
Those are filling up?
Yeah, we're talking early April now.
Okay, okay.
Because the Contango's getting bigger and bigger, right?
So people have more and more-
It just keeps getting bigger.
It's like Pac-Man.
It feeds on itself.
It just keeps going.
Okay.
And-
I don't know if that's exactly how Pac-Man works,
but I like it.
Keep going.
You're too young, man.
No, no, I'm not.
I played Pac-Man, but does Pac-Man feed on itself?
What, what, what, what?
Yeah, that's it.
Very good.
All right, so basically now the big boys are tired.
They're like, hey, look,
we got all the storage we want.
And I stopped getting calls.
I know they're done.
They're kind of, they're sated.
By early April,
the only storage left that you could book
was very difficult to get to.
So you got all these nooks and crannies,
you got, you got terminals, you know,
basically all over the, you know,
landlocked terminals, small tanks,
you know, that are barge access only,
you know, it's truck, truck access,
do that kind of thing,
where it's going to cost you a lot more
to get it there.
And by this week,
a lot of those nooks and crannies
had been booked up.
After the break,
there will be negative oil prices.
We are almost to this moment,
AKA Monday,
when the price of oil for the first time in history
goes to negative $37 a barrel.
But there's one more very important thing
we got to talk about before we get there.
And this very important thing
goes back to that world of purely financial oil,
of oil as a hedge or as a bet,
of oil as an abstraction on a computer screen.
The fact is this,
the number of barrels of oil
that people are promising to buy and sell
at Cushing, Oklahoma in the future
is much, much larger
than the number of barrels
that will actually be sold
at Cushing, Oklahoma.
So for example,
if you look right now
at contracts for a few months out,
for this summer,
people are promising to deliver
like something like a billion barrels of oil a month
in Cushing this summer.
But there is no way this is gonna happen.
Everybody knows it.
In fact, the number of barrels of oil
that people are promising to deliver
is like 10 times as high
as the actual number of barrels
that are gonna be delivered.
And in normal times,
this is actually not a problem.
Month after month,
it's fine.
And that's because financial oil people
who have promised to buy oil
but have no intention
of actually buying any real oil
get matched up
with other financial oil people
who have promised to sell oil
but really have no intention
of actually selling any oil.
Some money changes hands,
the bet is paid off
and the contract evaporates.
It's just like in Candy Crush
when the little candy pieces
match each other and line up
and they just go poof
and they disappear
like they never existed.
But there is this moment
every month
when the contract
for the coming month expires,
a deadline,
a clear deadline.
And this is the moment,
the minute, the second
when this abstract financial bet
on the price of oil
turns into a promise
to buy or sell a thousand barrels
of real physical oil
in Cushing, Oklahoma next month.
This deadline is right there
in the fine print
Ed Crooks read to us.
Trading terminates
three business days
prior to the 25th calendar day
of the month
prior to the contract month.
This month, that meant yesterday.
That meant Tuesday, April 21st.
If you were an investor
who had no intention
of taking delivery
of a thousand barrels of oil,
you had to sell your contract
by Tuesday.
On the day that it happens,
it happens at half past two
in the afternoon.
It's very fun.
It feels very Cinderella.
I was just,
that's exactly the image
I was using yesterday.
As you say, the big thing is
at the end of the night,
your carriage turns into a pumpkin.
And so you have to get out
of the ball before that happens.
You cannot be left
sitting in a pumpkin
when midnight strikes.
And that's something
that a lot of investors were facing.
And by pumpkin,
you mean a thousand barrels of oil
and nowhere to put them.
Exactly that.
So in other words,
as those investors
are getting anxious
to sell their contracts,
so they don't actually have
to take delivery of oil,
they rush to sell
and the price starts to fall.
And here, the abstract investment
oil world meets
with the world of physical real oil.
People see the price falling
and they call Ernie at the Tank Tiger
and they say,
hey Ernie, I want to buy this contract,
take delivery for the next month.
Can you find me some place
to put the oil?
That is exactly what happened Monday
when the price of oil was imploding.
I had dozens of phone calls
from financial institution
type hedge fund people.
Can you find me storage?
Can you find me storage?
That kind of stuff.
What did you say when they called?
I said, I can't help you.
Why not?
Well, I knew there was no storage
and they wanted prompt storage.
Everything that was going on yesterday,
I was just kind of eating popcorn
and watching.
It just wasn't,
there wasn't any,
I couldn't help anybody.
That is what happened.
Some set of people
or institutions in the financial world
were trying to sell
their abstract investment oil contracts
before they suddenly magically turned
into real physical oil.
And because there was nowhere to put
the real physical oil
and the contract was about to expire,
nobody wanted to buy it.
When people are very desperate to sell
and nobody wants to buy,
the price of anything will fall very, very fast.
And that is why the price of oil
for delivery in Cushing in May
briefly fell to negative $37 a barrel on Monday.
By the time the contract actually expired
on Tuesday afternoon,
it had shot back up to the positive,
but still very, very low price of around $10.
And oil selling at $10 a barrel,
according to Ed Crooks,
is sending a pretty straightforward message
about the state of the world.
The oil market is pointing to
this very, very sharp decline in activity.
It's saying,
look outside,
look at the roads,
look at the stores,
look at the shopping malls,
look at the sky at the aircraft not flying.
The downturn in activity has been colossal.
And although the stock market's pulled back,
it's not really reflecting the scale
of the shock that we've had.
Also, Ed says,
that moment on Monday,
that moment when the oil market broke,
when financial oil crashed into the physical world,
the price went down and down and down.
That moment is also sending us a message.
Our world in general has become phenomenally complex
in terms of the physical world,
in terms of supply chains,
where we get our food,
where we get everything we need to live.
It's also become phenomenally complex
in the financial world,
as we learned during the financial crisis.
And what we saw during Monday
was an example of one of those complexities
leading to a very serious rupture,
really having quite a fundamental breakdown.
And you have to think,
given the huge strain that we're putting our economy
and our financial system under at the moment,
there's got to be more of those out there.
There's certainly going to be more things
that we can't even imagine right now,
but we're going to be finding out about
over the months to come.
Exciting.
Yeah, look forward to it.
Good news.
