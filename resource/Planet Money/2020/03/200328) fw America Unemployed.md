A record number of Americans filed for unemployment this week. The system isn't designed for this. What's next? | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

On Thursday mornings, the Department of Labor releases its weekly unemployment claims — something that never makes the news. On average, maybe a few hundred thousand sign up. But at 8:30am, they announced the worst spike in unemployment the country has ever seen, by far — a staggering 3,283,000 new claims for unemployment. In a week.

Today on the show — what it means to lose a job right now when the mandate for most of us is: Stay home. We look at an overwhelmed unemployment system – the system that exists, the one we dream of, and the one that's being built on the fly.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Here at PLANET MONEY, we've been hearing from a lot of our listeners about how their lives have been turned upside down.

CHELSEA SPRING: My name is Chelsea Spring (ph). I live in Long Island City, N.Y.

LORI WINSLOW: My name's Lori Winslow (ph), and I live in Louisville, Colo.

KATY SCOGGIN: My name is Katy Scoggin (ph). I've lived in New York City for the last 13 years.

DAVID ROOT: My name is David Root (ph), and I live in Cincinnati.

WINSLOW: I am a gourmet ice cream producer.

ROOT: Basically, I'm a symphony musician.

SPRING: Managing director of a skin care facility.

SCOGGIN: I am a documentary filmmaker.

KAREN DUFFIN, HOST:

They were like all of us a few weeks ago, watching the country slowly shut down. And then, all at once, they were no longer just spectators.

ROOT: In a period of about 24 to 48 hours, literally every gig that I had on my calendar was wiped out.

WINSLOW: Wednesday, we were told our distributor is not picking up their last order and that they're not placing any more orders until further notice.

SCOGGIN: It became very clear that there was no other job that I could go out there to get.

SPRING: And then Wednesday, I was informed that Thursday would be my last day on payroll.

DUFFIN: All of them suddenly without work, along with more than 3 million other people in America.

SMITH: On Thursday morning, the Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment claims. Now, this never makes the news. Usually, just a few hundred thousand people sign up, and nobody talks about it. But at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, they announced 3,283,000 people filed new claims for unemployment in a week - the worst spike in unemployment the country has ever seen.

DUFFIN: More than 3 million people asking, what's next?

SCOGGIN: So I did something the other day that I never thought I would do. I stopped autopay on my rent.

DUFFIN: How long do you think your rainy day fund will take you?

ROOT: I mean, I could probably manage a couple months.

WINSLOW: If it's two months, it's going to be a little more uncomfortable. And if it goes more than that, that's when I feel like I'm playing with fire.

SPRING: So I pulled up the Department of Labor website, and it says, file now.

DUFFIN: OK.

SPRING: I'm going to just refresh this because - oh, yeah. Now I'm getting an error message. So it says, we're sorry. We are unable to serve you at this time due to technical difficulties or scheduled downtime for internal processing.

WINSLOW: Do I pay my health insurance premium, which is $1,300 with a $20,000 deductible? Do I take that out of my savings to pay the rent when somebody in my house might get sick?

DUFFIN: Is it still giving you the error?

SPRING: Yes. I just reloaded the page. And, yeah - unemployment services are currently unavailable. But what does that even mean? Like, why can't you even select the button?

SMITH: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Robert Smith.

DUFFIN: And I'm Karen Duffin.

SMITH: Today on the show, what it means to lose a job right now. In normal times, it is a gut punch. But there are systems like unemployment insurance to help you along, to get you back on your feet and hopefully send you out to apply for new jobs.

DUFFIN: But right now, the mandate for most of us is stay home. Do not go to work. Like, the health of our country depends on people not working right now. And the unemployment insurance system is overwhelmed and unprepared for this record number of people with no job and nowhere to look for one.

SMITH: Today, we will look at the unemployment system - the one that exists, the one we dream of and the one that's being built on the fly right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SMITH: All righty. Today, we are going to tell you about how unemployment insurance works. It is a janky system. No one is really sure if it's up to the task. First, though, we go to the story of one woman - one woman who's trying to navigate this system.

DUFFIN: Hey, this is Karen Duffin from NPR.

KRISTIN CLARK: Hi. How are you?

DUFFIN: Good. How are you?

CLARK: All right.

DUFFIN: It just is such a bad question right now. We've got to figure out a different way to greet each other (laughter).

CLARK: I know. I know. It's, how are you? How are things? Well, they all pretty much suck (laughter).

DUFFIN: Kristin Clark (ph) lives in Baltimore. And about seven years ago, a friend of hers said, hey, there's a part-time job opening at my office. Are you interested? She'd been a stay-at-home mom for a while and was looking for some extra income, so she said, sure.

SMITH: The company provides short-term rentals of office equipment. Anywhere there's a pop-up need for a temporary office, Kristin is there.

CLARK: We did a lot of stuff for the fires in California. We'd do stuff at the Kennedy Center, conventions, law board (ph) rooms...

DUFFIN: The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, political conventions...

CLARK: Sporting events.

SMITH: It's a pretty small company, tight-knit. But they've been growing really quickly.

CLARK: We were busy - crazy busy, insanely busy. The first Friday in March, we were, like, high-fiving each other because we had record-setting sales for February.

DUFFIN: This was just about the time that news about the virus was starting to get more urgent. But then at the beginning of March...

CLARK: My day started to consist of email after email saying, you know, this order canceled, this order canceled. It was only, like, a week and a half, two weeks, everything that was on the schedule to go out completely canceled. And it happened so fast, it was almost - it was like I was in shock. It was unbelievable. I could just see my boss was getting just a little more distraught. We - our business operates - like, it's on - like, we have to have cash flow.

DUFFIN: On Thursday, March 12, about six of them were still in the office. It was late afternoon, early evening...

CLARK: And we were all kind of leaving staggered, and he just stopped us all individually and, you know, asked us to come into his office and said we're going to have to, you know, furlough you. This is the only way that he could foresee saving the company.

DUFFIN: Furloughed usually means that you're sent home without pay, but you still have a job. But it soon became clear that, no, it was more like she was getting actually fired.

CLARK: I don't - I'm not getting anything. Like, no, you can - here's the rest of your vacation pay. Like, you're going to have to take two weeks off. It was like I have no idea how this is going to shake out. It's - I don't even know how to describe it. I mean, it was - like, I was on a fast track for success and then went straight to poverty in a split second. I don't think anything could have prepared anybody for this.

DUFFIN: She did file for unemployment, which will help but just barely.

CLARK: We might be able to cover our rent with unemployment, and that's probably about it.

DUFFIN: So Kristin is in this weird situation. She's in an unemployment system that was created for a very different scenario, a system to just tide you over or incentivize you to get back on your feet.

CLARK: I mean, because unemployment, their whole thing is about trying to find you another job.

DUFFIN: Yeah.

CLARK: Well, how can you find another job if you can't leave your house...

DUFFIN: Yeah.

CLARK: ...And if nothing is open to go apply for a job?

SMITH: And she's right. The unemployment system was never created to handle something like this crisis. And, in fact, in some ways, you cannot imagine a worse system for dealing with a simultaneous nationwide shutdown.

DUFFIN: Which is what has not just Kristin but the economists freaking out. The crisis is moving so fast that, just last week, labor economist Heidi Shierholz with the Economic Policy Institute sent out a tweet in all caps with this prediction - the coronavirus shock will likely claim - all caps - 3 million jobs by summer. It was so shocking that she repeated it three times.

SMITH: That was last week's worst-case scenario, 3 million by June, which of course we've already passed this week in March.

HEIDI SHIERHOLZ: We've never seen anything like what's happening now. There's no - there's not capital letters big enough to sort of underscore what is going on now. The conditions have deteriorated so dramatically, we would be lucky if we saw only 3 million jobs lost by summer. It would be more like 14 or 15 million jobs lost by summer.

SMITH: Fourteen or 15 million jobs lost by summer, by June - that's worse than during the financial crisis a decade ago. And everybody just take a deep breath because that is the conservative mainstream estimate. It does get worse. The head of the St. Louis Fed said this week that unemployment could be worse than in the Great Depression. He was predicting up to 30% of American workers out of a job.

DUFFIN: And to handle all of that, we need an unemployment support system that is fast, comprehensive and has almost unlimited amounts of money, which I don't think is the system we have right now.

SMITH: True, but we're going to try and fix it after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF SAM VELVETINE'S "AT THE CROSSROADS")

SMITH: Unemployment insurance as we know it was conceived in the early 1900s in Britain, not to save the economy or even really as a gift to workers. It was put in place to stop the growing threat of British communists. It was a way of saying, oh, workers, workers, capitalists are still going to fire you and replace you with machines, but the government will take care of you just a little bit. So please do not start a revolution.

DUFFIN: Unemployment insurance then caught on in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. It was eventually mandated nationwide during the New Deal, but it was never supposed to replace your lost income - just provide a fraction of your paycheck while you looked for a new job.

SMITH: And if you've ever filed for unemployment, you know it still feels as slow and bureaucratic as something that was designed in the 1930s to fight communism. There are 50 separate unemployment systems for the 50 different states, and each and every state provides a different amount of money for different amounts of time and under different rules. Some states are clearly on top of it; some states suck. It is not exactly what you want during a nationwide crisis where unemployment is all happening at the same time.

DUFFIN: And more than that, unemployment insurance is, at its core, just a form of insurance like car insurance or home insurance. The assumption is always that only a few people will need it at any one time. That's the only way insurance works, really. So during good economic years, employers pay taxes for each worker that state governments then sock away into trust funds, and during recessions the states can pull money out of those trust funds slowly and bureaucratically.

SMITH: And listen, this works well if the unemployment rate goes up to 5 or 6 or 7%. But at the scale we're looking at today, there is simply not enough money socked away in those state accounts. And even if there were, the system to distribute it can be incredibly slow. Our labor economist Heidi Shierholz says it's too late. You go into the recession with the safety net you have, not the safety net you want.

SHIERHOLZ: In order to get things to people, there has to be some way to do that. There has to be some system in place to actually make that happen. And so we are absolutely going to be depending on the systems that are already there.

DUFFIN: OK. So here's how the unemployment system is set up right now in most states.

SMITH: How it worked pre-coronavirus.

DUFFIN: OK. B.C. - before coronavirus, that's right. So you have to have been working at a regular job within the last year. You also have to wait a week after being fired to apply for benefits, and then you have to prove that you are looking for work. And if you meet all of these requirements, you will then get a weekly check for, on average, $385...

SMITH: Which works out to about half the average paycheck in America, and you get it for six months. Although, again, it is very different depending which state you live in. For instance, in New Jersey, the maximum benefit is $713 a week; in Alabama, it's $275.

DUFFIN: And some of those numbers might seem low to some people, and that's because they're meant to be because unemployment insurance was always meant to be a little bit of help and a little bit of motivation, not, like, just a free ride. But motivation is not the problem when you cannot leave your home.

SMITH: And that brings us to A.C. - after coronavirus. Congress just passed - literally as we are saying these words, they have just passed the rescue package that includes hundreds of billions of dollars extra to support the unemployed. And here's what the system now looks like.

DUFFIN: OK. So take Kristin for example who we just heard from. For the first four months, she will get the normal benefit her state provides plus an extra $600 a week from the federal government. That is thanks to this rescue package. And for a lot of people, that will put them close to their regular paycheck.

SMITH: That is a start. And we should say, once again, that is only the first four months of your unemployment you get this extra $600 in your check. And there is another bonus. Instead of just a half a year of benefits, in most states, insurance will now last for at least nine months, so Kristin, who lives in Maryland, should end up getting 39 weeks of checks.

DUFFIN: All right. So the money is now there. But remember, that new money now has to flow through the old system - that 50-state communist-fighting janky unemployment system.

SMITH: An unemployment system that's a little out of practice. Karen, do you remember the boom times, the golden era, the eternal spring?

DUFFIN: Very, very vaguely, but I seem to remember there were good times, yes.

SMITH: Yes. That was three weeks ago. Three weeks ago, we were at near-record-low unemployment. So the entire system across the nation was getting around 200,000 new claims a week. There was not much to do at your typical state unemployment office. I imagine them playing solitaire all day and waiting for some request to come in. Now there is this tsunami of claims. Again, Heidi Shierholz, the labor economist.

SHIERHOLZ: So it's just this unprecedented shift that these systems are having to deal with. I mean, just think of a business who went from (laughter) doing, you know, 200,000 widgets a week to 2 million widgets a week. It's just the personnel they have to bring on, the systems they would have to get in place to meet that demand.

SMITH: The infrastructure of the system is old. Websites are crashing. I couldn't get through to the Maryland Office of Unemployment to verify what Kristin would be getting. I've been trying all morning. Here in New York, you can now only apply for unemployment insurance on certain days of the week depending on the first letter of your last name.

DUFFIN: And states are starting to jettison all those old rules, like no waiting period before you file. Just go, go, go, if you can get through on the website.

SMITH: And, of course, states are starting to waive that requirement that you go out and look for work. And, frankly, even if you could leave your house, what is out there?

SHIERHOLZ: Like, if you're a restaurant worker, what are you - what kind of job are you going to search for when your whole sector is shut down?

DUFFIN: Also the congressional rescue package, it even has money for people who have traditionally not been able to get unemployment checks at all. It has checks for independent contractors.

SMITH: Although it is not clear right now how the system will determine what their salary is or how much money they will get to replace that. As we said, every state is different with different rules and different laws.

DUFFIN: This process of reworking the unemployment system for this new era is just beginning, so there is a lot of TBD.

SMITH: To be determined. Heidi Shierholz says that once we're through this crisis, there will be pressure to change the system, to fix all these weird loopholes and problems with the unemployment system. One of the biggest things she thinks we should change is why even require people to be laid off in order to get benefits? The firing and then rehiring everyone - that just slows down economic recovery. Some European countries are doing this right now. They're essentially paying businesses to keep everyone on the payroll, giving the workers unemployment benefits while they still technically have a job.

SHIERHOLZ: So that when the threat of the virus is over, when the lockdown is over, they can just go right back to their jobs. You can just turn the lights back on, and we can get the economy going again. That's the situation that would make the recovery so, so, so much faster and better for America, better for America's workers.

SMITH: Because remember that layoffs are also devastating to employers, too. Most businesses do not want to let people go, both for emotional reasons but also for business reasons. Imagine trying to restart your business after all this is over and you have to find a new staff.

SHIERHOLZ: It's just really expensive for firms to have to find people, hire them, get them in, get them onboarded, get them trained up. That's not actually producing anything, so it delays the recovery.

DUFFIN: Oh, that makes sense. It'll be even longer to get back on our feet.

SHIERHOLZ: Yes, exactly.

SMITH: Now, there are parts of the rescue package that try to help with this. There are loans to small businesses that are forgiven if these businesses retain their workers. And some states have programs that will pay unemployment insurance to workers who have had their hours reduced but are still employed. But other states don't have this program. There are still a lot of questions right now about who will get what. And frankly, with millions of new claims a week, there isn't anyone at the state offices with time to answer these questions.

DUFFIN: And so right now, more than 3 million people across America, like the listeners we talked to, are left looking for their own answers.

SCOGGIN: Like, the first week of March, I was hardly getting out of bed in the morning. I was not putting clothes on. I was just sitting around in my pajamas and binge-reading news articles about what was going on with COVID. When I made the decision to leave - so I live with my mom and dad now. I hope not to be celebrating my 40th birthday here.

(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXIS TOUTZIARAKIS SONG, "LOUDER")

ROOT: I am right now working out some livestream concerts with some of the orchestras that I work with for their patrons to keep audiences engaged.

WINSLOW: I can't really determine my next step until I know what's coming in.

SPRING: Well, I try not to stare at my phone all day.

SMITH: (Laughter).

ROOT: The sort of emotional trauma of it is real. I don't think it really sunk in for - until about a week afterwards.

SCOGGIN: I don't know.

DUFFIN: Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of questions and not a lot of answers right now.

ROOT: How is this going to change the landscape of symphony orchestras and the arts industry in general so that when this is over, we get people back into the concert halls? We can't have a public that's, like, traumatized of large spaces or afraid to go out to a concert, you know?

WINSLOW: What happens for us if 75% to 85% of the clientele that buys your product close up shop and can't get started again?

CLARK: One of the hardest things is because you always want to think about, like, what did you do wrong so that you could fix it - you know, that flaw. And when you can't figure out how to change anything, it's always like you can't wrap your head around it.

DUFFIN: It's like all of our normal problem-solving skills just don't apply.

CLARK: They don't apply.

DUFFIN: How are you staying sane?

WINSLOW: (Laughter) I'm not. I'm not. No, it's - you know, you - what else - what choice do you have? You can't throw in the towel yet. You just don't know. This is how I look at it. You make a plan that helps you sleep at night.

DUFFIN: Yeah.

WINSLOW: And then you wake up in the morning and figure you're probably going to have to deal with it again. I mean, so really, it's just one day at a time for now.

DUFFIN: Yeah.

WINSLOW: And I think it's going to be that way for a while.

CLARK: There's got to be a happy ending. It's America.

(LAUGHTER)

DUFFIN: I want to believe that with all my heart. I do.

CLARK: That's all we got.

(SOUNDBITE OF ALEXIS TOUTZIARAKIS SONG, "LOUDER")

SMITH: So as you could tell from this show, we want to hear your story about what's happening in your life, both in terms of your job, economics, supply chain, whatever it is. We're depending on you to be our eyes and ears on this crisis. You can contact us at planetmoney@npr.org or on all the social media. We're @planetmoney.

DUFFIN: Darian Woods, Liza Yeager, Nick Fountain and James Sneed produced the show today. Isaac Rodrigues helped on engineering. Alex Goldmark is our supervising producer. And Bryant Urstadt edits the show.

SMITH: Our sibling podcast, The Indicator from Planet Money, is a daily show that's doing lots of really great coverage on the coronavirus and its economic effects right now. You need to add that to your listening. I'm Robert Smith.

DUFFIN: I'm Karen Duffin. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

This is Planet Money from NPR. Here at Planet Money we've been hearing from a

Alrighty today we are going to tell you about how unemployment
insurance works. It is a janky system and no one is really sure
if it's up to the task. First though we go to the story of
one woman. One woman who's trying to navigate this system.
Hey this is Karen Duffin from NPR. Hi how are you? Good. How
are you? All right. It just is such a bad question right now. We
got to figure out a different way to greet each other. I know
I know. How are you? How are things? Well they all pretty much
suck. Kristen Clarke lives in Baltimore and about seven years
ago a friend of hers said hey there's a part time job
opening at my office. Are you interested? She'd been a
stay at home mom for a while and was looking for some
extra income. So she said sure. The company provides
short term rentals of office equipment. Anywhere there's a
pop up need for a temporary office, Kristen is there. We
did a lot of stuff for the fires in California. We do
stuff at the Kennedy Center, conventions, law war rooms. The
Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, political
conventions, sporting events. It's a pretty small company
tight knit but they've been growing really quickly. We were
busy, crazy busy, insanely busy. The first Friday in
March we were like high fiving each other because we
had record setting sales for February. This was just
about the time that news about the virus was starting to
get more urgent. But then at the beginning of March. My
day started to consist of email after email saying you
know this order canceled, this order canceled. It was
only like a week and a half, two weeks. Everything
that was on the schedule to go out, it completely
canceled. And it happened so fast. It was almost like I
was in shock. It was unbelievable. I could just see
my boss was getting just a little more distraught. Our
business operates like we have to have cash flow.
On Thursday, March 12, about six of them were still in
the office. It was late afternoon, early evening.
And we were all kind of leaving staggered and he just
stopped us all individually and asked us to come into
his office and said we're gonna have to you know
furlough you. This is the only way that he could
foresee saving the company.
Furlough usually means that you're sent home without
pay but you still have a job. But it soon became
clear that no, it was more like she was getting
actually fired.
I'm not getting anything. No, anything. Here's the rest
of your vacation pay. You're gonna have to take two
weeks off. It was like I have no idea how this is
going to shake out. I don't even know how to
describe it. I was on fast track for success and then
went straight to poverty in a split second. I don't
think anybody could have prepared anybody for this.
She did file for unemployment which will help
but just barely.
We might be able to cover our rent with
unemployment and that's probably about it.
So Kristen is in this weird situation. She's in
an unemployment system that was created for a
very different scenario. A system to just tide you
over or incentivize you to get back on your
feet.
I mean because unemployment, their whole thing is
about trying to find you another job.
Well how can you find another job if you can't
leave your house and if nothing is open to go
apply for a job.
And she's right. The unemployment system was
never created to handle something like this
crisis. And in fact in some ways you cannot
imagine a worse system for dealing with a
simultaneous nationwide shutdown.
Which is what has not just Kristen but the
economists freaking out.
The crisis is moving so fast that just last
week labor economist Heidi Scheerholz with the
Economic Policy Institute sent out a tweet in all
caps with this prediction.
The coronavirus shock will likely claim all caps
three million jobs by summer.
It was so shocking that she repeated it three
times.
That was last week's worst case scenario.
Three million by June which of course we've
already passed this week in March.
We've never seen anything like what's happening
now. There's no there's no there's not capital
letters big enough to sort of underscore what
is going on now.
The conditions have deteriorated so
dramatically.
We would be lucky if we saw only three
million jobs lost by summer.
It would be more like 14 or 15 million jobs
lost by summer.
Fourteen or 15 million jobs lost by summer
by June.
That's worse than during the financial crisis a
decade ago.
And everybody everybody just take a deep breath
because that is the conservative mainstream
estimate.
It does get worse.
The head of the St.
Louis Fed said this week that unemployment
could could be worse than in the Great
Depression.
He was predicting up to 30 percent of
American workers out of a job.
And to handle all of that we need an
unemployment support system that is fast
comprehensive and has almost unlimited
amounts of money which I don't think is
the system we have right now.
True but we're going to try and fix it
after the break.

Are you sometimes confused by the
economy befuddled by the financial
system troubled by the trade war.
We are here to help with a daily 10
minute briefing on economic news of the
day.
NPR is the indicator from planet money.
Listen now.
Unemployment insurance as we know it
was conceived in the early 1900s in
Britain not to save the economy or even
really as a as a gift to workers.
It was put in place to stop the growing
threat of British communists.
It was a way of saying oh workers
workers capitalists are still going to
fire you and replace you with machines
but the government will take care of
you just a little bit.
So please do not start a revolution.
Unemployment insurance then caught on
in the United States in the 1920s and
1930s.
It was eventually mandated nationwide
during the New Deal.
But it was never supposed to replace
your lost income just provide a
fraction of your paycheck while you
looked for a new job.
And if you've ever filed for
unemployment you know it still feels
as slow and bureaucratic as
something that was designed in the
1930s to fight communism.
There are 50 separate unemployment
systems for the 50 different states
and each and every state provides a
different amount of money for different
amounts of time and under different
rules.
Some states are clearly on top of it.
Some states suck.
It is not exactly what you want during
a nationwide crisis where unemployment
is all happening at the same time.
And more than that unemployment
insurance is at its core just a
form of insurance like
car insurance or home insurance.
The assumption is always that only
a few people will need it at any
one time.
That's the only way insurance works
really.
So during good economic years
employers pay taxes for each
worker that state governments then
sock away into trust funds.
And during recessions the states
can pull money out of those
trust funds slowly and
bureaucratically.
And listen this works well if the
unemployment rate goes up to five
or six or seven percent.
But at the scale we're looking at
today there is simply not enough
money socked away in those state
accounts.
And even if there were the
system to distribute it can be
incredibly slow.
Our labor economist Heidi
Scheerholtz says it's too
late. You go into the recession
with the safety net you have
not the safety net you want.
In order to get
things to people
there has to be some way to do
that. There has to be some system
in place to actually make
that happen.
And so we are absolutely
going to be depending on the
systems that are already there.
OK. So here's how the
unemployment system is set up
right now in most states.
How it worked pre coronavirus.
OK. BC before coronavirus.
That's right.
So you have to have been working
at a regular job within the
last year.
You also have to wait a week
after being fired to apply for
benefits.
And then you have to prove that
you are looking for work.
And if you meet all of these
requirements you will then get
a weekly check for on average
three hundred and eighty five
dollars.
Which works out to about half
the average paycheck in America
and you get it for six months.
Although again it is very
different depending which state
you live in. For instance in
New Jersey the maximum benefit
is seven hundred and thirteen
dollars a week in Alabama.
It's two hundred and seventy
five.
And some of those numbers might
seem low to some people.
And that's because they're
meant to be because unemployment
insurance was always meant to
be a little bit of help
and a little bit of motivation.
Not like just a free ride.
But motivation is not the
problem when you cannot leave
your home.
And that brings us to AC
after coronavirus.
Congress just passed literally as
we are saying these words they
have just passed the rescue
package that includes hundreds
of billions of dollars extra to
support the unemployed.
And here's what the system now
looks like.
OK so take Kristin for example
who we just heard from for the
first four months she will get
the normal benefit her state
provides plus an extra
six hundred dollars a week
from the federal government.
That is thanks to this rescue
package.
And for a lot of people that
will put them close to their
regular paycheck.
That is a start.
And there is another bonus
instead of just a half a year
of benefits in most states
insurance will now last for at
least nine months.
So Kristin who lives in
Maryland should end up getting
39 weeks of checks.
All right. So the money is
now there.
But remember that new money
now has to flow through the
old system that 50
state communist fighting
janky unemployment system
and unemployment system that's
a little out of practice.
Karen do you remember the
boom times the golden
era the eternal spring.
Very very vaguely.
But I seem to remember there
were good times.
Yes yes. That was three weeks
ago three weeks ago we were at
near record low unemployment.
So the entire system across
the nation was getting around
two hundred thousand new claims
a week.
There was not much to do at
your typical state unemployment
office. I imagine them playing
solitaire all day and
waiting for some request to
come in.
Now there is this tsunami
of claims.
Again Heidi Scheerholz the
labor economist.
So it's just this
unprecedented
shift that these systems
are having to deal with.
I mean just think of a
business who went from
doing you know two hundred
thousand widgets a week
to two million
widgets a week.
It's just the personnel they
have to bring on the
systems they would have to get
in place to meet that
demand.
The infrastructure of the
system is old.
Websites are crashing.
I couldn't get through to the
Maryland office of
unemployment to verify what
Christian would be getting.
I've been trying all morning
here in New York.
You can now only apply for
unemployment insurance on
certain days of the week
depending on the first letter
of your last name.
And states are starting to
jettison all those old
rules like no waiting
period before you file just
go go go if you can get
through on the website.
And of course states are
starting to waive that
requirement that you go out
and look for work.
And frankly even if you
could leave your house.
What is out there.
Like if you're a restaurant
worker.
What are you what kind of
job are you going to search
for when your whole sector
is shut down.
Also the congressional rescue
package it even has money
for people who have
traditionally not been able
to get unemployment checks
at all.
It has checks for independent
contractors.
Although it is not clear
right now how the system
will determine what their
salary is or how much
money they will get to
replace that.
As we said every state is
different with different
rules and different laws.
This process of reworking
the unemployment system for
this new era is just
beginning.
So there is a lot of
TBD to be determined.
Heidi Sherhold says that
once we're through this
crisis there will be
pressure to change the
system to fix all these
weird loopholes and
problems with the
unemployment system.
One of the biggest things
she thinks we should change
is why even require
people to be laid off
in order to get benefits
the firing and then
rehiring everyone that
just slows down economic
recovery.
Some European countries
are doing this right now.
They're essentially paying
businesses to keep everyone
on the payroll giving
the workers unemployment
benefits while they still
technically have a job.
So that when the threat
of the virus is over
when the lockdown is
over they can just go
right back to their job.
You can just turn the
lights back on and we
can get the economy going
again.
That's the situation that
would make the recovery
so so so much faster
and better for America
better for America's
workers.
Because remember that
layoffs are also
devastating to employers
too.
Most businesses do not
want to let people go
both for emotional
reasons but also for
business reasons.
Imagine trying to restart
your business after all
this is over and you
have to find a new
staff.
It's just really
expensive for firms to
have to find people
hire them get them
get them on board and
get them trained up.
That's not actually
producing anything.
So it delays the
recovery.
Oh that makes sense.
It'll be even longer to
get back on our feet.
Yes exactly.
Now there are parts of
the rescue package that
try to help with this.
There are loans to
small businesses that
are forgiven if these
businesses retain their
workers and some states
have programs that
will pay unemployment
insurance to workers
who have had their
hours reduced but are
still employed.
But other states don't
have this program.
There are still a lot of
questions right now
about who will get
what and frankly with
millions of new claims
a week there isn't
anyone at the state
offices with time to
answer these questions.
And so right now more
than 3 million people
across America like
the listeners we talk
to are left looking
for their own answers.
Like the first week of
March I was hardly
getting out of bed in
the morning I was not
putting clothes on I
was just sitting around
in my pajamas and
binge reading news
articles about what
was going on with
Covid and I made
the decision to leave.
So I live with my
mom and dad now.
I hope not to be
celebrating my 40th
birthday here.
I'm right now working
out some live stream
concerts with some
of the orchestras
that I work with for
their patrons to keep
audiences engaged.
I can't really
determine my next step
until I know
what's coming in.
Well I try not to
stare at my phone all day.
The sort of emotional
trauma of it is real.
I don't think it really
sunk in for until
about a week afterwards.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah there's a lot of
questions and not a lot
of answers right now.
How is this going to
change the landscape
of symphony orchestras
and the arts industry
in general so that
when this is over
we get people back
into the concert halls.
We can't have a public
that's like traumatized
of large spaces or
afraid to go out
to a concert you know.
What happened for us
is 75 to 85 percent
of the clientele
that buys your product
close up shop
and can't get started again.
One of the hardest
things is because
you always want to
think about like
what did you do wrong
so that you could fix it.
You know that flaw
and when you can't
figure out how to
change anything
it's always like
you can't wrap
your head around it.
It's like all of our
normal problem solving skills
just don't apply.
They don't apply.
How are you staying
sane.
I'm not.
No.
You know you see
what else.
What choice do you have.
And you can't throw
in the towel yet.
You just don't know.
This is how I look at it.
You make a plan
that helps you sleep at night.
Yeah.
And then you wake up
in the morning
and figure you're
probably going to have
to deal with it again.
So really it's just
one day at a time
for now.
Yeah.
And I think it's going to be
that way
for a while.
There's got to be
a happy ending.
It's a miracle.
I want to believe that
with all my heart I do.
That's all we got.
