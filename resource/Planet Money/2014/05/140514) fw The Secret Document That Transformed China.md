ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

And I'm Audie Cornish.

China just reported its economy is growing at an impressive pace, nine percent a year. As remarkable as that number is, it's not new. China has been growing at about that rate for more than 30 years. But how did this boom first get started?

SIEGEL: Well, the answer, it seems, is pretty simple. It began with a secret document hidden in the roof of a mud hut. The people who signed it back in 1978, were afraid that the document and the idea behind it might get them executed. Instead, it transformed China.

David Kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein, with our Planet Money Team, brought this story back from the rural village of Xiogang.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: Today, Xiogang has paved roads and new factories. In 1978, there were just muddy paths and oxen, houses made of dirt and straw.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: This is the height of communism in China. Everyone here worked on the village's collective farm. The idea was people would work together for the common good.

KESTENBAUM: Yen Jingchang was a farmer back then. In this world, as he describes it, nobody owned anything.

YEN JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) I used oxen to farm but they weren't mine. They belonged to the group.

(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) Back then even a piece of straw belong to the group. Individuals didn't own anything.

GOLDSTEIN: At one meeting with Communist Party officials, a farmer asked: What about the teeth in my head? Do I own those? No, was the answer. Your teeth belong to the collective.

KESTENBAUM: There was no incentive to work hard, to get up early and pull weeds.

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) Work hard and don't work hard, everyone gets the same, so people don't want to work.

GOLDSTEIN: In Xiogang there was never enough food. Yen Jingchang says he and the other farmers had to knock on doors and beg for food.

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) We were farmers. We were supposed to produce food. To beg for food was not honorable. My face was burning.

KESTENBAUM: This is the way things were all over China, the way the entire economy was set up. So, in the winter of 1978, after another terrible harvest, the farmers in Xiogang came up with an idea. But the idea they had was so dangerous, they had to call a secret meeting to discuss it.

This is Yen Hongchang, another farmer who was there.

YEN HONGCHANG: (Through Translator) That day, it was about five in the afternoon. We made it to Yen Lihua's home. This was a secret meeting. And we snuck in one by one.

GOLDSTEIN: Eighteen farmers gathered in this small dirt-floored room. Yen Jingchang was one of them.

KESTENBAUM: Were there enough chairs for all of you?

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) There were no chairs back then. How could there be chairs? Some of us crouched. Some sat on the floor. There were some little tiny stools. But we had no chairs back then.

KESTENBAUM: Here's the idea they discussed. Rather than farm as a collective, each family would get to farm its own plot of land. And if a family grew a lot of food, that family could keep some of that food. You own what you grow.

GOLDSTEIN: This is a very old idea. But in communist China in 1978, it's also a very dangerous idea.

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) Most people said, yes, we want to do it. But there were others who said, I don't think this will work. This is like high voltage wire. Back then, farmers had never seen electricity but they had heard about it. They knew if you touched it, you would die.

KESTENBAUM: They decide they have to try this and they decide to write it down, as a formal contract so everyone is bound to it. Someone gets a piece of paper. And by the light of an oil lamp, Yen Hongchang writes this historic thing down.

GOLDSTEIN: It says they're going to secretly divide up the land among the families. And it ends with this: If any of us are put in prison or executed, the others in the group will raise our children until they're 18 years old.

KESTENBAUM: With this document, they become, in a sense, the first capitalists of modern China. Yen Hongchang ends up hiding it in a piece of bamboo in the roof of his house.

GOLDSTEIN: Yen Jingchang remembers the first day he went out to farm after signing the contract.

Did you work harder than before?

JINGCHANG: (Through Translator) Of course I work harder. We all did because whatever I produce was mine. If you didn't work hard that's your loss. And we all secretly competed.

(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)

HONGCHANG: (Through Translator) Everyone wanted to produce more than the next person. That got people working hard.

GOLDSTEIN: So it's the same land, the same tools, the same people. But just by changing the economic rules, by saying you get to keep some of what you grow, everything changes.

KESTENBAUM: The farmers are terrified of being found out. But by the end of the season it becomes impossible to keep things secret anymore, because they've had an enormous harvest. More food, Yen Hongchang says, than in the previous five years combined.

GOLDSTEIN: Word of what had happened in Xiaogang makes its way up the Communist Party chain of command. Fortunately for the farmers, at this moment in history, there are powerful people in the Communist Party who want to change China's economy. Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader who creates China's modern economy, is just coming to power. So instead of executing the Xiaogang farmers, the Chinese leaders hold them up as a model.

KESTENBAUM: Within a few years, farms all over China adopt the principles in that secret document: People can own what they grow. The government launches other economic reforms and China's economy starts to grow like crazy. Since 1978, something like 500 million people have risen out of poverty in China.

GOLDSTEIN: The Communist Party is clearly proud of what happened in Xiaogang. That contract, it's now in a museum. And what happened in the village has become this origin story in China that kids learn about in school.

KESTENBAUM: But what's happened to the guys who started it all, the country's first capitalists? Here things get complicated. Our first day in Xiaogang, we asked to talk to Yen Hongchang, the farmer you heard from who actually wrote this contract. But the local Communist Party officials told us he was out of town.

GOLDSTEIN: It turns out, that wasn't true. We found him the next day.

Were you here yesterday?

HONGCHANG: (Through Translator) I was here yesterday.

(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: We were told you were not here yesterday.

HONGCHANG: (Through Translator) I was here yesterday.

GOLDSTEIN: Yen Hongchang, and the government officials. They tell two very different stories about Xiogang today.

KESTENBAUM: Yen Hongchang says he started a couple businesses over the years, but the local Communist Party took them away from him once they became profitable. He says those new factories springing up around town, they're largely empty and haven't created many jobs.

GOLDSTEIN: Local officials say none of this is true. They say everything in Xiaogang is going great.

KESTENBAUM: I'm David Kestenbaum.

GOLDSTEIN: And I'm Jacob Goldstein, NPR News.

**faster whisper:**
Hey, it's Jacob Goldstein.
Just a quick note.
Today's show is a rerun.
It first aired a few years ago after David Kestenbaum and I went to China.
Hey.
Welcome to Planet Money.
That's right.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today the story of a secret document written in a small village and hidden in the roof
of a mud hut.
The people who signed this document, they were afraid it might get them executed.
Instead, it wound up completely transforming China's economy.
But before we get to that secret document in the roof of a mud hut that transformed
the country, let's just get a feel for where China is today.
Let's start out on a train.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Beijing Shanghai express train.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just any train.
This is part of China's new bullet train network, the largest in the world.
It is a great pleasure to have you on board.
I want some speed, though.
Like, so far it's just like a train.
I want a little more bullet.
Then some conductor pushes the bullet train button or whatever and it starts to move
faster.
There's actually a readout that tells us our speed, 130 kilometers an hour.
138, 140.
Tops out at over 300 kilometers per hour.
That's over 200 miles an hour.
It makes Amtrak look primitive.
Bullet train stations here, they are these huge gleaming things like airports.
And what's really striking about this whole picture is just how far China has come
in just a few decades.
Our story happens in 1978, a year when most Americans had cars and garages.
I was nine years old sitting on the couch watching Welcome Back Cotter on television.
Your contemporaries in China at this time, David, for the most part, they didn't
even have electricity.
You could argue that this transformation, that change that took China from mud huts
to bullet trains, started in a single small village in rural China.
The village is called Zhaogang, and we went there.
It's very nice to meet you.
Thank you for talking to us.
Oh, no, it's no trouble.
Thank you for coming.
This is Yan Jinchao.
And by the way, none of the people we talked to in Zhaogang spoke English.
So what you're hearing here is a translation.
Yan Jinchao, he's one of the people who started China on this path to bullet
trains. And one of the really fun things about reporting on China's economy is,
well, so if you're in the U.S.
and you want to talk to one of the founding fathers of the U.S.
economy, you want to talk to Alexander Hamilton, you're out of luck.
He's been dead for hundreds of years.
But in China, a lot of these key people, they're still around.
Yan Jinchao is not an economist.
He's not a politician.
He runs a small restaurant in Zhaogang.
Thirty years ago, when all this happened, he was a farmer.
Yan Jinchao opens a big metal gate behind his restaurant, and he takes us
out to the fields where he used to farm.
Back in 1978, everyone here worked on a collective farm.
Look, you can grow things in winter.
Mao, Mao Zedong had just died, and it was still basically the height of
communism in China.
And on our visit to this village, we actually spent a long time just
trying to figure out how the system worked on a communist farm.
The basic idea was that people would work together for the common good.
And in this world, as Yan Jinchao explains it, nobody owns anything.
I used oxen to farm, but they weren't mine.
They belonged to the group.
Back then, even a piece of straw belonged to the group.
Individuals didn't own anything.
At one meeting with communist party officials, one farmer asked,
what about the teeth in my head?
Do I own those?
No, was the answer.
Your teeth belong to the collective.
Everything in this world was centrally planned.
The farmers were told what to plant by a communist party official from
outside the village.
And sometimes they were told to grow rice, even if they didn't have
enough water to properly grow rice.
Yan Jinchao says, back in this era, every morning a whistle would
blow to mark the start of the work day.
Sometimes the guy blowing it would have to blow it twice.
The farmers would drag themselves out of their huts and
go to work on the fields.
At the end of the day, the whistle would blow again, and
everyone would stop.
You'd get points for working all day, but it didn't matter
how much or how hard you worked.
You just had to show up.
Even if you had decided to go out early and pull weeds or
something, it wouldn't make a difference for you.
Work hard and don't work hard.
Everyone gets the same.
So people don't want to work.
And after the harvest, the government collects what
everyone has grown and gives the village
an allotment of food.
But in the case of Xiaogang, the allotment was never enough.
So they were hungry all the time.
Their kids never had enough to eat.
And Yan Jinchao and the other Xiaogang farmers, they
had to walk to other villages and beg for food.
We were farmers.
We were supposed to produce food.
To beg for food was not honorable.
We felt very ashamed.
It was hard to knock on doors and beg for food.
My face was burning.
This is the way things were all over China.
This is basically the way the entire economy was set up.
So the farmers in Xiaogang were starving, and they
needed to do something.
One farmer in particular was pushing for a change.
His name, Yan Hun Chang.
We tracked down Yan Hun Chang as well.
And we talked to him in this open garage attached to
his house.
There were sacks of grain piled up along the walls.
He smoked cigarettes the whole time.
It was this really cold, rainy day.
And he told us that out of desperation, the farmers came
up with an idea.
But the idea they had was so dangerous, they had to
call a secret meeting to discuss it.
That day, it was about 5 in the afternoon.
We met at Yan Lihua's home.
This was a secret meeting.
We snuck in one by one.
There were 18 farmers crowded into this small room.
Yan Jinchao was there.
Were there enough chairs for all of you?
There were no chairs back then.
How could there be chairs?
Some of us crouched.
Some sat on the floor.
There were some little tiny stools.
But we had no chairs back then.
Yan Hun Chang says everybody there was afraid to talk.
So finally, he spoke up.
I said, everyone is here and knows what this is about.
And everyone knew.
But no one dared to speak.
So I spoke up.
I said, we are all here because we have to find a
way to save ourselves.
To save themselves, they have an idea that is both
revolutionary and as old as dirt.
Rather than farm as a collective, each family gets
to farm its own plot of land.
And if a family grows a lot of food, that family gets to
keep some of that food.
You own what you grow.
But owning in Communist China in 1978, that's
something like treason.
I was scared.
But if you were too scared, you wouldn't be able to
do it.
And that wouldn't work.
So in this little dirt-floored room by the
light of a broken down oil lamp, these farmers are
talking about this idea.
The older farmers who remembered the days before
communism when they could farm their own land, they
said, we have to try this.
But a lot of the guys in the room, they were really
scared.
Most people said, yes, we want to do it.
But there were others who said, I don't think this
will work.
This is like high-voltage wire.
Back then, farmers had never seen electricity.
But they had heard about it.
They knew if you touched it, you would die.
But they decide they have to do this.
The alternative is to continue begging and
going hungry.
They decide they need to write this down, write
down a contract laying out how this is going to
work, and put their names on it so they're all
bound to it, so no one can go back on it.
There's only one problem.
Paper, just plain paper, is hard to come by in
Zhaogang in 1978.
Yan Hun Chang told us he was going to write on a
cigarette pack.
But it turns out this other farmer had some paper, so
he runs to get it.
And Yan Hun Chang writes this historic thing.
It's short.
It's just a few sentences long.
Do you remember the exact words that you wrote?
I wrote it myself.
Of course, I remember.
Can you tell it to us?
We will divide up the farmland between the
families.
The head of each family signs or stamps his approval.
Each family will give a share of the crop to the
government and the collective at the end of the year.
If we are put in prison or executed, we will not
complain.
And the others in the group will raise our
children to 18 years old.
They are, in a sense, the first capitalists of
modern China.
Their livelihood is in their own hands.
If it works, they'll have enough to eat.
If they get discovered, they could be killed.
But one by one, the farmers come forward to sign
onto the contract.
They realize they need to hide this thing.
And eventually, Yan Hun Chang winds up slipping it
inside a piece of bamboo in the roof of his house.
Yan Jin Chao remembers the first day he went out to
farm after they signed the contract.
It just felt different.
I felt comfortable in my heart, energized.
I could really show off my abilities.
Did you work harder than before?
Of course I worked harder.
We all did.
Because whatever I produced was mine.
If you didn't work hard, that's your loss.
And we all secretly competed.
Everyone wanted to produce more than the next
person.
That got people working hard.
It's amazing to think this is the same land.
They have the same tools.
It's the same farmers.
But just by changing the economic rules, just by
saying you get to keep some of what you grow,
everything changes.
We started work before the sun came up.
And we worked until it was dark.
This working all the time thing actually gets them
into trouble.
Yan Jin Chao says the neighbors noticed it.
And they started to suspect something funny was
going on.
Why were these crazy farmers going out to work
before the whistle blew, before dawn?
And why were they working so late?
And at harvest time, there was an even bigger
problem.
It was impossible to hide.
They had an enormous harvest.
It was more food, according to Yan Jin Chao,
than they had grown in the previous five years
combined.
It was both exciting and terrifying.
One day Yan Jin Chao gets a call from some
local party officials.
They summon him to their offices.
When he gets there, he says they swear at him.
And they treat him like he's on death row.
They say they're going to lock him up.
Fortunately for Yan Jin Chao, at this moment in
history, there is this really broad debate going
on in China.
There are powerful people within the party who are
saying we need to try some economic experiments.
And in fact, the regional party chief in this
area, he was one of these pro-reform guys.
And he had visited Yan Jin Chao and had said to
him, what you're doing here, it looks interesting.
You should keep at it.
So when Yan Jin Chao gets called in, he begs for
permission to make one phone call.
He gets it and he calls the regional party chief,
the guy who had been supportive.
And luckily for him, the official answers the
phone.
But the local official next to Yan Jin Chao, he
grabs the phone away from him.
He grabbed the phone.
But I could still hear what the regional party
chief was saying.
He said, do not change anything.
I approved this experiment.
Allow him to continue working on the farm.
So they let Yan Hun Chang go.
He goes back to the village and keeps farming.
And this experiment, it keeps working.
Eventually, word of what's happening in
Xiaogang makes it up the chain of command
through the Communist Party to the very top,
to Deng Xiaoping, the guy basically running
China at this time.
Deng Xiaoping is one of the pro-reform guys.
At this moment, he is poised to become the
key reformer who creates China's modern economy.
Deng Xiaoping has been wanting to change the
way farming works in China.
And he likes what's happening in Xiaogang.
But this is still Communist China.
It's just two years after the death of Mao.
And lots of people are opposed to what's going
on in Xiaogang.
So Deng can't say anything bad about Mao
or collective farming.
Deng's big picture idea is let's not worry
about whether something is capitalist or
communist or socialist.
Let's worry about whether it works.
There's this famous quote that's attributed
to Deng that, David, we actually heard all the
time when we were in China.
It doesn't matter if a cat is white or black.
As long as it catches mice, it's a good cat.
Deng Xiaoping doesn't stand up in public
and give these Xiaogang farmers medals.
He's quieter about it.
He decides to have these two writers tell the story.
He calls them in and says, I support this.
You guys should go tell the Xiaogang story
to the rest of China.
And pretty soon, people all over China are
farming like the people in Xiaogang.
Farmers own what they grow.
The government starts trying out other
economic experiments.
Factories spring up in cities along the coast.
China lets foreign companies in.
Coca-Cola opens a plant in Beijing.
And China's economy grows like crazy.
And this crazy economic growth, it has gone on
and on for more than 30 years now.
Since the farmers in Xiaogang signed that contract,
something like 500 million people in China
have risen out of poverty.
They've moved from mud huts with dirt floors
and oil lamps to houses with electricity.
They've moved into a world of cities and high rises
and new roads and bullet trains.
People all over China know the one sentence version
of the Xiaogang story.
If you're driving by the town on the highway,
there's a little sign by the highway exit.
There's a small museum in town
telling the story of the contract.
And it is this incredible true story
that marks the beginning of China's economic rise.
But when you look at what has happened in Xiaogang
since then, things get complicated.
They get especially complicated
when it comes to Yanheng Chang,
the guy who should be sort of a hero of modern China,
the guy who was the first one to speak at the meeting,
who actually wrote the contract and hid it in his roof.
But on our first day in town,
when we asked the local Communist Party officials
if we could talk to Yanheng Chang,
they told us he was out of town.
But we went back to Xiaogang the next day
and we found Yanheng Chang,
which is why you heard him in the story.
We asked him if he had been out of town.
Were you here yesterday?
Yesterday.
I was here yesterday.
We were told you were not here yesterday.
So at that time, what's that?
I was here yesterday.
When you ask about what happened in that hut in 1978,
everybody agrees.
Everybody tells the same story.
But when you ask about what has happened
in Xiaogang since then,
Yanheng Chang and the party officials,
they tell two very different stories.
The official version is that everything in town is great.
New factories are springing up.
There are lots of jobs.
Xiaogang is living happily ever after.
Yanheng Chang says he's had a different experience.
He says he started a few businesses over the years,
but once they became profitable,
the government took them away from him.
He also says those new factories springing up around town,
a lot of them are just empty.
Local officials say none of this is true.
The tension you hear, though,
really throughout the Xiaogang story
between free enterprise and state control,
that is everywhere in China today.
The government has let go of some parts of the economy,
but it's holding on tightly to other parts.
That fancy bullet train network, for example,
is run by the government.
And in 2011, there was a collision that killed 40 people.
The head of the railway ministry
was arrested on corruption charges.
More generally, there is a question
about whether China's economic growth will continue,
or if maybe not too far off,
the country's incredible run will run out.
We'll post some photos from Xiaogang on our blog.
