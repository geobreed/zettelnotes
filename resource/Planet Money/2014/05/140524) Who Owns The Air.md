Tons of entrepreneurs have come up with clever ways to make money using little drones: farmers, who want to spot aphids on their soybean plants; ranchers trying to find lost cows; crews wanting to film shiny cars cruising on windy roads. There's just this one little problem – according to the Federal Aviation Administration – all these people- they are breaking the law. Today on the show: drones are proliferating, but who owns the air? If you buy a house, you know you own the ground. But what about the space above it? Who exactly, owns that?

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Patrick Egan (ph) was a housing contractor. And he also had this hobby. He liked to fly little remote control airplanes. One day he put a camera on the airplane, start to fly it around and take pictures. And he wonders, is there some way I can make money with this? Kind of an odd thing to think about. I mean, who exactly is going to be interested in taking photos from 10 stories up?

STEVE HENN, HOST:

Well, it turned out there were people interested in doing just that - people trying to sell condos, condos that hadn't even been built yet.

PATRICK EGAN: What it basically was is what the view would be like out of your condo.

HENN: Egan would go out to these construction sites that were still vacant lots. He'd send his drone with a camera up into the air. And by drone, I mean basically it's a 5-pound Styrofoam model airplane. And he'd fly it in circles up in the empty air at 10 stories up, 15 stories up, however high the building was supposed to go. And he'd click pictures all the way up.

KESTENBAUM: The people trying to sell the condos, they had these mockups of the rooms on the ground, you know, like a room with a couch and a fake fern. And they'd paste these photos that were taken with the drone into the windows so they could simulate what the whole room would look like to try to sell you a condo on the 10th floor or the 15th floor. It's got a better view.

HENN: So they'd show the mock up and they'd be like, and this is what it would look like if you spent $100,000 more.

EGAN: Exactly. And so write us a deposit check. And they were getting checks like hotcakes. And it was on - my pictures were on billboards and all kinds of stuff. And so I was like, wow, you know, OK, this isn't bad.

HENN: Egan was getting paid. And it turns out there are lots of people like Patrick Egan, entrepreneurs who'd come up with clever, sometimes kind of crazy ideas to make money using drones.

KESTENBAUM: There were farmers who wanted to spot little aphids on their soybean plants.

HENN: There were ranchers who wanted to find lost cows.

KESTENBAUM: There were advertising crews wanting to film shiny cars cruising on windy roads.

HENN: There was just one little problem. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, all these people - they are all breaking the law.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

KESTENBAUM: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum. And you? You are Steve Henn.

HENN: I am. I cover technology for NPR. But now I am joining the PLANET MONEY team.

KESTENBAUM: Woo-hoo. Today on the show, the tiny flying robots are proliferating. But who owns the air?

HENN: If you buy a house, you know you own the ground. But what about the space above it? Who exactly owns that? This odd question, it turns out people have been trying to work out an answer to this question for a long time. David, did you ever take Latin?

KESTENBAUM: No way. I did not.

(LAUGHTER)

HENN: Me neither. But there's this Latin phrase that's relevant here.

STUART BANNER: You know, I'm not sure I'm even pronouncing this right.

HENN: This is Stuart Banner, a law professor at UCLA.

BANNER: Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum.

KESTENBAUM: Translation - he who owns the soil owns up to the heavens, basically giving homeowners claim to stars and planets across the universe.

HENN: Stuart banner wrote about this in a book called "Who Owns The Air." And he says for centuries, English common law was built on this idea - you own the land, you own the space above it.

BANNER: The earliest cases involved things like overhanging tree branches, buildings that were built lopsided so they leaned into the neighbor's airspace and so on.

HENN: When disputes were over tree branches, this maxim worked pretty well. It made sense.

KESTENBAUM: It made sense until the hot air balloon and eventually the airplane. Was it OK to have these things up in the air if people on the ground owned up to the heavens? A hundred years ago, a lot of people were worried about this.

BANNER: You know, lawyers, of course, but also in just general interest magazines and newspapers, all sorts of debates about whether aviation would even be possible just because, you know, wouldn't an aviator be trespassing everywhere that he flew?

HENN: There were all sorts of proposals to solve this.

BANNER: Including, you know, ideas that sound pretty silly in retrospect, like, you know, making airplanes fly above streets rather than above private land. That didn't work out, obviously.

HENN: In theory, airlines could have worked out contracts to pay each landowner they fly over a small amount, but that was just impractical.

KESTENBAUM: And unnecessary really because landowners were not out there jumping up and down saying, hey, that's my property up there in the sky. Farmers were fine with hot air balloons drifting over their fields. If an airplane flew by, people would just point at it and wonder, look, an airplane.

HENN: And so in 1926, the government just takes the airspace. The government lays claim to the heavens. Congress creates what today we call the FAA and declares the air above the minimum safe altitude of flight is a public highway and part of the public domain.

KESTENBAUM: Basically, what this means is that in most places if you're flying 500 feet above the ground, you're fine. You're flying through public property.

HENN: That old idea of landowners owning the space above the ground, that fades away. And for a while, everyone seems OK with this, except there is this one guy who is not OK with it at all.

KESTENBAUM: Thomas Lee Causby. And, really, the problem is that it's not OK for his chickens. Cosby was a chicken farmer who lived near the sleepy little civil airport in Greensboro, N.C. During World War II, the Army took over the airport. And suddenly, these big military planes were flying over Causby's chicken coops all the time.

HENN: And they come in just 83-feet above the ground, right over the top of his barn. And they are literally scaring his chickens to death. The chickens hear these planes, they see the lights and they panic. They would fly into the walls of the coop and die. Causby had to give up chicken farming.

KESTENBAUM: So Causby sued, and this case about chickens scared to death goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Causby argues, in effect, that the federal government took his property by flying planes so low over his land.

HENN: And the Supreme Court, it is in this really awkward spot. The justices don't want to give a chicken farmer control over airplanes, but they feel like he has a point. They want to give him something. Here's what Justice William Douglas writes. (Reading) If a landowner is to have full enjoyment of the land, he must have exclusive control of the immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere. Otherwise buildings could not be erected, trees could not be planted, even fences could not be run.

KESTENBAUM: Very nice. Basically, chicken farmer wins.

HENN: But how high does it go? Like, how much air above his head does he now own?

KESTENBAUM: Clearly, not to the heavens, right? And the court actually put a number on this. The number was 83 feet. That is how far above the ground those planes were flying that scared his chickens to death. It's about the height of a medium-sized maple tree, 83 feet.

HENN: But the thing about this decision is while it solved this particular chicken problem, it created a big new one.

KESTENBAUM: It left this gap, this unclaimed territory in the air. Remember the government had laid claim to airspace 500-feet up and higher. That was a public highway. The Supreme Court now said that below 83 feet, that belonged to the chicken farmers or whoever owned the land.

HENN: But who controlled the space in between, the space above 83 feet but below 500 feet? There are 417 feet in there. Who owned that?

KESTENBAUM: That was left vague. And for years, it didn't really matter. No one really cared about that 417 feet of unclaimed air. After all, who would ever want to fly something so close to the ground? No one, until now, until drones.

HENN: Whenever there's unclaimed territory and the means to occupy that space, it's kind of an American tradition. You will find pioneers trying to stake a claim.

CY BROWN: (Unintelligible) that's going to go right over your head, man...

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Right.

BROWN: ...If you don't mind.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: As long as it doesn't go on my head.

BROWN: There you go.

KESTENBAUM: Meet Cy Brown, electrical engineer, drone entrepreneur and father.

BROWN: Cy's from Louisiana, and he's kind of a character.

HENN: There's this YouTube video of him at a fishing camp with his daughter, Alyssa.

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)

HENN: They're in a bayou, and there's this big old alligator floating just off the dock.

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)

HENN: That sound is of Cy sticking his toes in the water and wiggling them around...

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)

BROWN: Is he coming?

HENN: ...Luring the gator closer.

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)

BROWN: OK, I'm going to close my eyes. And you have to tell me whenever he's close enough to bite my toes, OK? Is he close enough?

ALYSSA: He's getting closer. He's getting closer. He's getting closer.

BROWN: Shhh, be quiet. You're going to scare him. Oh, boy, here he comes. Oh, oh...

HENN: At the very last second, he kicks the gator in the head.

(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)

BROWN: (Laughter).

ALYSSA: You got him.

BROWN: Yeah, I popped him right on the nose.

ALYSSA: Do it again.

BROWN: (Laughter) Well, how about we do it with your toes?

ALYSSA: (Shrieks).

BROWN: (Laughter).

HENN: This is just the kind of guy Cy Brown is. He's willing to try stuff other people wouldn't do, things that would never even occur to other people to do.

KESTENBAUM: Which is exactly how Cy got into drones. Where he lives in Louisiana, there's this problem, feral wild pigs. They're a menace. They run around wrecking everyone's crops. And they are very hard to get rid of because they're hard to find when they're in a giant farm field. So Cy came up with a solution.

(SOUNDBITE OF FLYING DRONE)

HENN: Cy took a little remote control plane, equipped it with a camera - and this is the key part - several thousand dollars of heat-seeking sensors. He flies the drone over the fields at night, and the drone sends back live video to his laptop. And thanks to the heat sensors, the pigs are now easy to spot. You can tell if there are five or six pigs hiding in a field, even when the rice is high. And you can tell exactly where they're hiding.

BROWN: About 50 yards down to the left or to the west of that ditch that you're in. It looks like there's two pigs.

HENN: He's talking on a walkie-talkie here to his partner James, who's in a field with a high-powered rifle.

BROWN: Pig in the tracks with you. There you go, get him.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOTS)

BROWN: Yep, he's down.

KESTENBAUM: Cy has a name for his invention, the Dehogaflier.

HENN: Our entrepreneur had found his opening. Cy started a company called Louisiana Hog Control. He got a decal for his truck and things looked promising.

KESTENBAUM: The USDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, liked Cy's idea. They wanted to copy it. Cy appeared in Time magazine and The Economist and on TV stations and newspapers.

HENN: But when I called Cy last month to ask if he'd take me hunting, he said no. He said the Dehogaflier had been grounded. I asked him what was going on, and he kind of paused. This man who sticks his bare feet in the bayou and wiggles his toes to tease an alligator, he told me I'd have to talk to his attorney, which I did. But his attorney wouldn't talk about Cy's case. He did say, though, that many people who fly drones have been getting letters, letters from the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration.

KESTENBAUM: We've got a couple of these letters, and I have one here. This one is to a commercial photographer in California. And weirdly, it is - it's kind of - it's chatty. It begins, my name is Brad Howard. It goes on to say I recently viewed your website. While I applaud your innovative use of the UAS, I must inform you the FAA has taken steps to ensure the public safety regarding all UAS operation. UAS is unmanned aerial system.

HENN: The FAA, normally in charge of all things above 500 feet, is now worried about what's going on below. And this letter just kind of highlights the oddness of the situation here. Remember, the FAA is used to regulating 20-ton airplanes filled with hundreds of people hurdling through the air at 600 miles an hour, 30,000 feet above the ground. They make sure pilots are trained and well-rested. They make sure planes meet safety standards. Apparently, they now have similar concerns about tiny, little drones.

KESTENBAUM: The letter goes on to note that drones are not, quote, "manufactured or maintained to the standards of manned aircraft" and that most pilots wishing to fly drones, quote, "are not trained, certified or familiar with the rules of the air." And it tells the photographer he has to shut his drone down.

HENN: So there is now this big fight over this unclaimed window of airspace. Cy, the pig exterminator, would love to use it. The FAA is saying, well, wait.

KESTENBAUM: And the rest of us are left here on the ground asking that question that we had at the beginning, who controls the air?

HENN: Sixty-eight years ago, it was a chicken farmer who led the charge for landowners under airplanes. In the drone era, it's people who enjoy sunbathing in the backyard or people with big windows.

KESTENBAUM: Michael and Laura Kirschner have a big window. They live in a beautiful spot in San Francisco.

MICHAEL KIRSCHNER: You have a view that reaches all the way out to the Golden Gate Bridge. You can see the Pacific Ocean. You could see the mountains.

HENN: Michael Kirschner talked to our colleague and friend Laura Sydell. And he told her one day, a drone appeared outside that window and appeared to be staring at his wife.

KIRSCHNER: She got me, and I came out. And then she started, like, hiding behind furniture because something's looking in at you, right? And you're very self-conscious about that all of a sudden. And I found myself doing the same thing. You're hiding behind your own furniture in your own house where you just had privacy prior.

KESTENBAUM: He says he didn't know what to do. I mean, what do you do? You call the FAA. Do you call the cops? They decided to go public. In fact, lawmakers are hearing lots of stories like this. Last year, 43 state legislatures considered bills trying to regulate drones.

HENN: So the Kirschners were on their own, trying to figure this out.

KIRSCHNER: Inevitably you go down the path of if it comes again, how are we going to get it out of the sky, right? Like, can we throw things at it? Can we shoot water at it? The best idea I came up with was to buy some kind of remote control device and ram into it.

HENN: And honestly, the best approach to this problem is totally unclear. I mean, it's not even clear if the drone was invading their property by peering in their window.

KESTENBAUM: Lots of things are unclear. Will Cy's Dehogaflier fly again? If so, when?

HENN: Right now, we're in a situation no one is happy with. Everyone is waiting for someone - Congress, the courts, the FAA, really anyone to spell out exactly what the rules are to answer the question of how this unclaimed window of airspace can be used.

KESTENBAUM: Patrick Egan, the guy who was taking pictures with his drones to help sell condos, he also got a call from the FAA telling him to stop until the rules could be sorted out.

HENN: They told him that would take about two or three months. But it was seven years ago, and he's still waiting.

HENN: I'm Steve Henn. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "COFFEE")

SYLVAN ESSO: (Singing) Get up, get down, get up, get down. Feel the turn of rotation, stop, see the next one waiting. Get up, get down, get up, get down. Get up, get down. Get up, sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change. Get up, get down, oh, get up, see the next one waiting. Get up, get down, get up get down. Get up, sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change.
