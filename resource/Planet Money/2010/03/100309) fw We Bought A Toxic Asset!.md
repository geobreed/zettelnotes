We wanted to really understand how this whole housing bust/economic catastrophe is playing out. So we sent David Kestenbaum and Chana Joffe-Walt to Kansas City, where a former Wall Street guy named Wit Solberg runs a shop that buys and sells toxic assets. Wit sold them a $1,000 sliver of a toxic asset he'd bought for $36,000. The asset — a bond made up of residential mortgages — was marked down from the pre-crash price of $2.7 million. Of course, it's marked down for a reason. About 15 percent of the homes in the bond are in foreclosure, and nearly half are behind on their payments. The foreclosures will continue to mount, and at a certain point our asset will be wiped out. But until then, we'll get monthly payments. If we make it to Thanksgiving, we could double our money. (We'll be giving any profits to charity, by the way.)

On today's Planet Money:

Remember toxic assets? Those insanely complicated bonds that almost brought down the financial system?

We bought one.

We thought it would help us figure out how the housing bust is playing out. So we pooled our own money, about $1,000 in total. We sent David and Chana out to Kansas City, where a former Wall Street guy named Wit Solberg who evaluates toxic assets for his clients and sometimes buys the assets himself.

Wit sold them a sliver of a toxic asset he'd bought for $36,000. It was marked down from the pre-crash price of $2.7 million.

Of course, it's marked down for a reason. About 15% of the homes in the bond are in foreclosure, and nearly half are behind on their payments. The foreclosures will continue to mount, and at a certain point our asset will be wiped out. But until then, we'll get monthly payments. If we make it to Thanksgiving, we could double our money. (We'll be giving any profits to charity, by the way.)

We'll have a lot more on this later this week, including a radio story and some Web tools that will let you see how our asset is doing.

(SOUNDBITE OF BRITNEY SPEARS' “TOXIC”)

KESTENBAUM: Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. Today is Tuesday, March 9. I'm David Kestenbaum.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. That was my colleagues Alex, Caitlin, Adam and you, David, at the top, forking over 200 bucks you all owed me. We here at PLANET MONEY have pooled our cash, totaling $1,000, and gone in on a dubious investment opportunity. That's ahead on the show. First, our PLANET MONEY indicator.

KESTENBAUM: We have a sentimental indicator today. It is $3.28 trillion.

JOFFE-WALT: Aw, so that's probably a low estimate, $3.28 trillion in home mortgages that got packaged into complicated financial instruments that nearly brought down the global economy. This should be making you all feel very sentimental right about now.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. So they're called toxic assets. And, you know, we heard a lot about them. They had mortgages in them, started going bad and then these things started going bad. And they're so complicated, no one could tell exactly what they were worth. No one wanted to touch them.

JOFFE-WALT: No one except us. We did. We wanted to touch them, to study them. We wanted to buy our own toxic asset.

KESTENBAUM: And, Chana, I always just - I really wanted to own one, like, you know, like a pet. 'Cause they were so central to this whole crisis, you know, trillions of dollars in them, so complicated, so abstract. And I thought if we just own one, you know, then we could get the financial statements, we can pick it apart and it would give us a front row seat for the last act of this whole financial crisis.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So we were all really excited about the idea. And we've been sitting around the office talking about, you know, who might give us money for this experiment. I was hoping, David, maybe your parents would fund our...

KESTENBAUM: Not my parents.

JOFFE-WALT: Maybe NPR.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: No, but eventually, we decided, no, it's got to be us. It's on us. So you and Alex and Caitlin and Adam and I, we all each put in 200 bucks to total $1,000.

KESTENBAUM: And we all agreed if somehow we end up making money, we're going to give it all to charity. So, actually, you know, we're really nothing like normal investors. We're more like...

JOFFE-WALT: 'Cause...

KESTENBAUM: ...Philanthropists.

JOFFE-WALT: ...We have no upside, right?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, we...

JOFFE-WALT: We can only...

KESTENBAUM: ..Have no possibility for an upside.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Lose money. All right. So it is on. We've got the will. We've got the $1,000. Now we just have to buy one. It turns out that is not easy at all. You need to know a guy. And David, you knew a guy.

KESTENBAUM: If you've been listening to this podcast for a while, you may remember Wit Solberg. He was a Wall Street guy. He'd gone home to Kansas City to set up shop there. He started a small company called Mission Peak Capital. He's been helping tiny community banks that got stuck with these toxic assets, figure out what it is they own. And recently, he's been buying some toxic assets, also. And he said, sure. Come on down. I'll help you out. So we did.

JOFFE-WALT: This is it?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. Hey, Chana?

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah?

KESTENBAUM: I forgot my checkbook.

JOFFE-WALT: I got you.

KESTENBAUM: All right.

JOFFE-WALT: So, David, you took me to Kansas City to what feels like an abandoned alley. There's no one around. It's, like, an unmarked brick building. I feel like we're buying drugs.

Wait. This is really it, just in one of these little buildings?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. It used to be a barbershop, I think.

JOFFE-WALT: We go upstairs, and it looks a little more legit up there. There's maybe a dozen guys in a big open office. There's whiteboards with numbers and lists of bonds. And each desk has several computer monitors, sort of strewn empty bags of chips and with Snapple bottles and papers. And there was a tube of toothpaste on one guy's desk and chewing tobacco.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, they spit the chewing tobacco out into the Snapple bottles is...

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, that's right.

KESTENBAUM: ...How that works.

JOFFE-WALT: That would be Wit, Wit Solberg. And he's awesome. He's sort of this all-over-the-place guy. Like, he's always telling you several different things at once. And just getting him to sit down and say his name and title is tough.

WIT SOLBERG: OK. So we...

JOFFE-WALT: What's your name?

SOLBERG: Oh, OK. That's a good point.

JOFFE-WALT: You remember that?

SOLBERG: Yeah, I remember that.

JOFFE-WALT: Crazy morning banking?

SOLBERG: So my name's Wit.

KESTENBAUM: So Wit tells us, here's how the day is going to work. He's going to start by checking his email because brokers in New York, they send him emails about what bonds are for sale today. Bonds is code for toxic assets. And he's going to look at the toxic assets, the bonds, analyze them, and he's going to help us choose one he thinks we should spend our $1,000 on.

JOFFE-WALT: And this, David, this is the moment that I sort of realize I have no idea what I'm looking for. Like, I don't - what are we looking for? What am I trying to buy? This is actual money in my pocket. And Wit kind of answers these questions in the way that he answers everything - with a metaphor. He says it's OK. Just think of it like you're a farmer at an auction buying a cow.

SOLBERG: We've got the big, black Angus cow that everybody wants. Well, we're not buying that cow 'cause it's too expensive. We want the cow that kind of got a wounded leg, but she might, you know, she might produce a few more calves for us and is cheap. And nobody else knows that, you know, she's got a couple more years in her. And that's what we're after.

KESTENBAUM: So it's sort of like you spend $1,000 on the cow, and if you can make enough milk from that cow or get enough offspring from the cow that when you sell that stuff, you get $1,000, then you're good. And if you can make - sell it for more, then you've made money. So Wit takes us to his desk. He's got three computer monitors there. And he shows us the emails he's got about the bonds that are for sale from all the guys in New York.

SOLBERG: Bobby (ph) sends a lot of email, and Cliff (ph), and Duane (ph), and Adam (ph), and Cliff again and Chris (ph). And, you know - but we - you try to...

JOFFE-WALT: These are guys that you trust?

SOLBERG: They're guys that sell bonds.

KESTENBAUM: And, Chana, I love the emails. They have these subject lines like super senior steel. Another one says cheaper.

JOFFE-WALT: And then Wit picks one that he thinks looks promising, he wants to spend some time analyzing. And you and I, we just go with that. And then he and his guys set out to analyze it.

KESTENBAUM: Now, remember, there are thousands of mortgages in one of these toxic assets. So actually, if you got a mortgage in the last 10 years, it's possible we were looking at your mortgage. It's possible your mortgage was in here.

JOFFE-WALT: And it's very likely your mortgage is in some toxic asset.

KESTENBAUM: Some toxic asset somewhere. So Wit and anyone else who wants to figure out how much one of these things might be worth, they need to know, like, what are these mortgages? Who made the loans? Where are the houses? Are people making their mortgage payments?

JOFFE-WALT: And that is where Brandi comes in, the model, the computer model - also the wife, Wit's wife. The model is named after his wife, Brandi, who built the thing. And so for the next couple hours, you know, his guys are analyzing these bonds. And Wit is walking around the office, leaning over his staff, saying things like, what's Brandi telling you here? And, wow, look at Brandi's loss severity there. Or remember to balance what Brandi is saying against how realistic it really is.

KESTENBAUM: And Wit makes his way over to one of his staff, an analyst whose name is Rob (ph). And Rob works often in this back office that one guy called a bond cave. Like, Rob, get back to your bond cave.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: And Rob kind of looks like he stuck his finger in a light socket. He's sort of - he's both tired and keyed up at the same time. And Wit is standing behind him, looking over his shoulder.

SOLBERG: Are you working on your OMLT, Rob? Keep working on your OMLT.

JOFFE-WALT: They go back and forth for a while about the OMLT. And at some point, I realize, oh, they're not talking about eggs. They're talking about a bond, a toxic asset.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. So apparently, OMLT is an acronym for option, mortgage, loan, trust. And Rob says to Wit, I like this one. And Wit tells us we should like it, too. And we say, OK. We like it. Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: And now we start talking about price. And this is the first bit of information that really blows me away about this whole process. So Wit tells us we should bid - we should offer a half a cent on the OMLT, as in one half of one penny on the dollar, so less than 1% of what someone originally bought it for at, say, the peak of the housing market. So of course, they're not talking about spending just pennies. They're talking about spending thousands of dollars. But it's a way of them saying it's a fraction of the full $1.

KESTENBAUM: So Wit picks up the phone. And he calls Cliff, who is one of the brokers who sent those emails. And he says to Cliff, we'll bid a half a cent on the OMLT. And Cliff says, OK. Let me check with whoever's selling it, and I'll get back to you. So he hangs up the phone. And we wait. And then finally, Cliff calls back.

SOLBERG: Hey, Cliff.

CLIFF: Hey.

SOLBERG: What's happening?

CLIFF: So that OMLT bond...

SOLBERG: Yeah.

CLIFF: They're seeing high teens on that.

SOLBERG: (Laughter) That's [expletive]. That's ridiculous.

JOFFE-WALT: Wait, so what happened with the OMLT? Somebody bought it for high teens?

SOLBERG: That's what they're telling the trader.

JOFFE-WALT: And you bid half a cent?

SOLBERG: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: So there's real disagreement about what these things are worth?

SOLBERG: There's huge disagreement. I mean, honestly, this is not uncommon.

KESTENBAUM: So Chana, we got outbid by someone who was offering 30 times what we offered.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: And so this is why - I mean, you'll remember, these toxic assets were a problem in the first place because no one could figure out what 3,000 mortgages bundled into this complicated structure was worth, you know, now that the mortgages were going bad. And now these things are starting to move. People like Wit are - think they might have an idea of what they're worth. And they're buying and selling them. But this is still a huge problem. There's no consensus on what some of these things are worth. They're not worth the full dollar anymore. They're not worth nothing. But - so it's somewhere in between zero and everything.

JOFFE-WALT: And also, I mean, even if you want to find out more information - like, if you want to find out, OK, who made the mortgage loans to all these people? - a lot of times you can't because they don't exist anymore. Companies like Countrywide have just gone away. And then you say, OK, well, what about the people who are collecting payments from all of the people who pay the mortgages? So people who manage the mortgage payments, they're called servicers. And we sit down with Wit. And we're looking at this one bond and saying, OK, who are the servicers on this thing?

SOLBERG: There's a master servicer, who's the master in charge. And then everybody else is sort of the sub-servicers that collect the payment. And you got GreenPoint Mortgage, American Home Mortgage, Aurora, Countrywide Home Loan servicing, like, all these - GMAC Mortgage, Residential Funding Company, LLC, IndyMac. So half of these people that were responsible for collecting payments and monitoring this just vaporized. They're gone. They're responsible, you know, ultimately, to the master servicer. But the master servicer is gone. Ambeck is in this. OK, this has got everybody. This is like a convention of problems.

KESTENBAUM: And, Chana, even if we had that information, these bonds are still incredibly difficult to sort out. Each one is different. It has this complicated structure.

JOFFE-WALT: So we noticed there's this whiteboard in the corner of their office. And there's a bunch of song names on it. And we ask about it. And it turns out that this is to help them keep track of all of the different kinds of bonds. They're so complicated. And they all have different characteristics. So they use these songs to associate them with different kinds of bonds. And so Rob, the guy who looks like he's been electrocuted from the bond cave, he comes out of his bond cave. And he reads that list.

All right. So what do we have at the top here?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "THE GAMBLER")

KENNY ROGERS: (Singing) On a warm summer's evening...

ROB: Up, this is our credit IO that has a floating rate coupon. It is - we have classified it as "The Gambler." It's - - roll the dice. Who knows? I think we can go to the next one.

JOFFE-WALT: What is it?

ROB: This is the credit IO that has a fixed rate coupon - so a little more certainty because you actually know what you're getting each month.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "IT'S TRICKY")

RUN-DMC: (Rapping) ...To rock a rhyme that's right on time, "It's Tricky" is the title...

ROB: No principle still, still credit IO. And that is "It's Tricky," which...

JOFFE-WALT: By Run-DMC.

ROB: By Run-DMC.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "IT'S TRICKY")

RUN-DMC: (Rapping) ...It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky. It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time. It's tricky...

KESTENBAUM: They also have mid-credit IO with good value. The song for that is "Johnny Come Lately." High factor support is "O.P.P," you know...

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, you know me.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, you know me. Apparently, that one is because it feels like you're stealing other people's property.

JOFFE-WALT: So we get to Wit at 8 in the morning. And by 1:00, we still have not got our toxic asset, and not because we've been screwing around with music the whole time. Brandi, the model, has been working very hard, analyzing tons of bonds. But it seems like it's actually just really hard to find one that you can get cheap and still seems like it'll survive long enough for you to make some money, still seems like it has some life in it.

So 1:30, 2:00, we find this one toxic asset Wit gets excited about because she's mysterious. He doesn't quite understand what's going on. And he actually stands up at the whiteboard to write out just all the details, all the people who made the loans, all the other investors, and just to try to understand it just so that he can understand it. And as he's doing that, he kind of starts to guess at who the people in this bond are, what their stories are like.

SOLBERG: This guy got a $2.25 million loan, 30% loan to value. It's like a $7 million house, basketball player. So you - these are McMansions. This has more of a McMansion feel to it. You know, the other thing that's interesting here is you have 9% in Florida. And half of all of the loans in Florida went into default. So they had a guy in Miami, you know, just giving mortgages out on condominiums. And, you know, there they went. And so one of the things that we're determining here is, have the bad left the building, or do the bad still remain in the building? Rob?

ROB: Yeah?

SOLBERG: The purchase - this is...

JOFFE-WALT: I have a good feeling about this one.

KESTENBAUM: You have a good feeling about this one?

SOLBERG: Chana wants to buy it.

JOFFE-WALT: You hear the McMansions thing? I want this one.

KESTENBAUM: Chana, you know, I wanted this one that was filled with mobile homes.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, you told me that, modular.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. All right. So you're rooting for the McMansions. I want to own a bunch of mobile homes.

JOFFE-WALT: But he said mobile homes are very hard to - they haven't studied them at all. They don't...

KESTENBAUM: That's what I like about it. Nobody...

JOFFE-WALT: That's what you like about you?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, impossible to value - I just like that it's unvaluable. And that in the end, we'll find the answer.

So at this point, I actually get, for the first time, why so many people bought these things without reading all the paperwork, without fully understanding the details about how they're put together, because it's so mind-numbing, you know? I can see how easy it was to say, oh, look, this is complicated, but, you know, it's got a triple-A rating on it from a rating agency. Someone else has done all the work. OK, let's just buy it. Let's just buy one.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. It gets a little boring. You can only look at so many CUSIP numbers and LTVs before your eyes kind of glaze over and you just think, OK, this is the one. It's got a basketball player. That seems cool. I'll take this one.

KESTENBAUM: Actually, Wit wasn't so sure about the basketball player bond because there wasn't enough data for Brandi to evaluate it. And the way it works when you buy - try and buy a toxic asset, they're only up for sale for a couple hours. And in this case, the window is running out. And I'm - I was sitting the whole day like, aren't we supposed to be making a bid on this soon? Shouldn't we be getting to work on this? And in this case, we have only minutes to make a decision and Wit does something that makes me really nervous. He says, print the book.

JOFFE-WALT: The book, the prospectus - that 604-page document that describes the bond in excruciating detail.

KESTENBAUM: We're printing out 600 pages of the toxic asset? The prospectus? The entire prospectus?

SOLBERG: Yeah, you can take it home with you.

KESTENBAUM: Check bagged.

SOLBERG: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: You just got delivered the first hundred pages.

SOLBERG: Yeah. So we got the...

(SOUNDBITE OF PRINTER)

KESTENBAUM: And as the pages are coming out of the printer, I'm realizing I'm staring at a historical record of the entire financial crisis. It's all here on these pages - vaporized companies, people struggling to pay their mortgages, and some horribly complicated logic describing which bondholders get paid in which order, how much and under which conditions.

JOFFE-WALT: And Wit hunches over the pages as they come out with three highlighters and a pen, circling stuff in different colors and furiously turning the pages, time running out. And then he stops. There is a hidden time bomb on page 136.

You're laughing. That isn't seem like a good sign.

SOLBERG: (Laughter) So I guess...

ROB: Insolvent.

SOLBERG: ...In the event of insolvency of Lehman Brothers, payments due under the interest rate cap agreement may be delayed, reduced or eliminated. Dude, this is a disaster.

ROB: This is a disaster.

JOFFE-WALT: The disaster is the deadly interest rate swap. You don't need to know what that is. It's bad. Suffice it to say, I'm not getting my basketball player.

KESTENBAUM: And we go on like this for two days. We actually had to book a second night of hotels. But finally, we find a really, I think, beautiful, totally toxic asset at what Wit thinks is a good price, $36,000. That that seems like a lot of money. But the original sticker price was a lot, a lot more.

SOLBERG: $2.7 million.

KESTENBAUM: Meaning that's how much money, in theory, is supposed to be coming in from all the mortgages?

SOLBERG: Yeah, that's what - yeah.

KESTENBAUM: Wow. So someone originally was - someone was holding it and expecting to be worth a lot more money.

SOLBERG: Yeah, somebody - I guess a human being or an institution - had a - paid $2.72 million for this at - within very recent history.

KESTENBAUM: And you bought it for $36,000?

SOLBERG: That's right.

JOFFE-WALT: And now, we buy it, too. We buy a piece of that from Wit for $1,000, our own little encyclopedia of the financial crisis. We have to go down the street to a community bank in Kansas City to set up an account.

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: You must be David?

KESTENBAUM: I'm David.

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: All right.

KESTENBAUM: I'm from National Public Radio...

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: Nice to meet you.

KESTENBAUM: And this is Chana.

JOFFE-WALT: Hi. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: Hi. Nice to meet you. All right. Well, come on in. I'm actually going to introduce you to Kristi Bidler (ph).

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: She's going to go ahead...

KESTENBAUM: OK.

UNIDENTIFIED BANKER: ...And get you all set up. And you're needing to establish an account, correct?

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. We're opening up a toxic asset banking account.

They tell me to stop recording soon after this, so I do. We set up the account. And I write a check.

KESTENBAUM: All right. So we just came out of the back where they did not let us record, but where, Chana, you opened up that PLANET MONEY toxic asset account.

JOFFE-WALT: I have the certificate right here. We're now proud owners of what Wit called garbage.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

JOFFE-WALT: David, we get back to Mission Peak Capital. And that's when I sort of realized, like, oh, now we own - we actually do own a toxic asset. We own a tiny piece of 2000 mortgages all across the country. And I'm trying to picture in my head like, what does that mean? Like, sort of like we own a doorknob in each and every house or something.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, or like a few nails in the floor or something. And like a lot of investors, like, I only think I really understand what it is we bought this week.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. After you bought it.

KESTENBAUM: After we bought it. And that day we sat down with Wit at the computer to try and make sense of our toxic asset. And we looked at some of the outputs from the computer model.

SOLBERG: The - what Brandi's telling you here...

KESTENBAUM: Brandi is...

SOLBERG: Brandi's our model.

BRANDI: And your wife.

SOLBERG: And the wife. Here's a guy who is a - he got a loan for $2.4 million. Now, his house is located in Florida. And it's a planned urban development in Sarasota, all right? Pretty nice Sarasota place, right?

KESTENBAUM: You can tell the zip code.

SOLBERG: Yeah, there's a zip code. He owned...

KESTENBAUM: Three - three, two - 34240.

SOLBERG: Yeah, golf course community, maybe a cul-de-sac - something like that. So there was another guy in Sarasota. There's another guy in Sarasota. So you can start to get a feel that there was a guy in Sarasota who had a billboard who gave big loans, and those big loans went into this pool. This guy could be in the same cul-de-sac.

KESTENBAUM: Do you actually see these as real people, or do you look at them as data? I mean, do you feel anything for them? Do you say that poor guy?

SOLBERG: And we - you do feel for people that have gotten loans through these types of programs. You wish that they could stay in their house. But in this particular business? It's a data point.

JOFFE-WALT: Also, California, Arizona - basically in all the worst-hit parts of the country, we have mortgages. And we can't tell individual names on the data, but we can see the loan amounts. We can see, you know, here's one person who got behind on payments and then caught up a bit and then got foreclosed on. Almost 15% of the homes in our toxic asset are in foreclosure. Almost half are behind on their mortgage payments. So a lot of people are struggling. A lot of people have already lost their houses and a lot more will lose homes in the coming months.

KESTENBAUM: And at some point, those homes will be taken over and sold. And for investors, that's the important part. The bond basically owns the houses, right? They're the collateral on the loans. And as those houses get sold - to try and get as much money as possible - they're going to get sold for a loss because the housing market is crashed. And when that happens, when enough houses get sold for a loss, our part of the bond, our bond dies. And we get wiped out.

JOFFE-WALT: But until that happens, we get paid a bit of money. Every month we get a check. We just got a check for $141.09 this month. And if we keep getting checks - if the bond survives and we keep getting checks until July, we break even. We make the thousand dollars that all of us put in back. And if we make it till Thanksgiving, Wit tells us we could double our money.

What's the worst thing that could happen?

SOLBERG: Next month, they sell all the houses, and you get stuck with nothing.

KESTENBAUM: All right. So how we do depends on how long the bond lasts. And because this is the podcast, we can actually explain it to you.

JOFFE-WALT: Because, yeah, it's going to take a minute.

KESTENBAUM: It's going to take a minute. But we own what's called the B-6 class of the bond. So basically everyone who buys a piece of this bond, we're all standing in line to get paid. And some people are near the front of the line. And then there are people who are near the back of the line.

JOFFE-WALT: And we - B-6 - we are near the back of the line.

KESTENBAUM: And that is why our part of this thing is toxic. They're actually two people behind us right now. We're at the B-6 class. Behind us is the B-7 investor and the B-8 investor. And as the houses get foreclosed on, taken over and sold, then there are fewer and fewer houses in our bond, which means less money coming in, less money to pay out to investors. And the folks who lose out first are at the back of the line. So I like to think of it as like there's this monster grabbing the last person in line and eating them.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter) Yeah, right. So yes, so bond holders B-12, B-11, B-10, B-9, they got eaten. That monster has, like, digested them a while ago. And the monster is now chewing on B-8. And he is going to finish eating B-8 and then attack B-7. And then, he's going to get to us.

KESTENBAUM: So it's really just a question of when the monster gets to us - or, you know, when enough houses get taken over and sold for a loss that we get shut out of the bond payments.

JOFFE-WALT: OK, so that's the basic structure of where we sit as an investor in this bond. But the bond overall, like, as we're getting to know it, there's so much we can't know about the bond. And we will never probably figure out. So we sit with Wit for our last couple of hours and just try to figure out what it is and what its life has been.

Who did we just buy this from?

SOLBERG: Well, you bought this from me.

JOFFE-WALT: And who did you buy it from?

SOLBERG: I bought this on an auction through a California broker-dealer.

JOFFE-WALT: And you don't know who they were selling it for?

SOLBERG: We do not, no. We just put a bid. They just put in a bid on our behalf.

KESTENBAUM: Can you guess who might have on this? What type of place would have bought this?

SOLBERG: Yeah. A lot of times, people were buying these - Some people actually sold them to banks - community banks, insurance companies, things like this.

KESTENBAUM: Pension funds? Might have this been part of someone's retirement - some big retirement fund?

SOLBERG: Correct. That's correct.

JOFFE-WALT: And could it also have been on the books of like the big banks that we heard about holding all the toxic assets like Citigroup and Bank of America?

SOLBERG: Yeah. And where it would have - why they would have held it on their books usually would have been to redistribute it.

JOFFE-WALT: So it might have been held by small community banks, insurance companies, pension funds or big enormous banks.

SOLBERG: That's right.

JOFFE-WALT: Or all of those.

SOLBERG: That's right.

JOFFE-WALT: So now we own part of this - and you do, too. In a bigger sense, what are we providing? Are we helping these people?

SOLBERG: No, you're not helping these people. You - if you have any reason to purchase this product, the reason is to make money. But...

JOFFE-WALT: Are we helping the people who owned this stuff that we bought it from?

SOLBERG: No, you're not doing anything. There's no higher purpose to purchasing these bonds.

JOFFE-WALT: But I can't picture in my mind some small community bank in Ohio that's been holding this and - wishes they hadn't and now, I've just taken a piece of that off of their hands?

SOLBERG: It's...

JOFFE-WALT: ...Loosened them up and made them - made it possible for them to...

SOLBERG: No, they would've - no, because what would have happened was that they'd have to recognize that loss. Ninety-nine - they would have bought it for 100. And now, they've just recognized the fact that they've lost 99, you know?

JOFFE-WALT: Someone has to buy it, right?

SOLBERG: Well, that's right. And I don't disagree with buying it. That's why we do it. But we think it's profitable. Now, whether it's - whether you can make a connection, that it's benefiting somebody directly, - whether it's the mortgagers or the market - it will be beneficial for people who own something to better understand its value.

JOFFE-WALT: I see. So what we're actually doing is we're saying to whoever holds this, you think - you don't know what it's worth, or maybe you think it's worth whatever. And we think it's worth $0.02 on the dollar.

SOLBERG: Yeah, you've raised your hand and you said it's worth a penny and a half. And by the way, that's better than nobody raising their hand at all.

KESTENBAUM: Of course, there could be a very good reason no one was raising their hands. Maybe it wasn't worth what we paid for it.

JOFFE-WALT: Right.

KESTENBAUM: Maybe it was worth less than a penny. Maybe the person who sold it, you know, good job. They got rid of it.

JOFFE-WALT: They should have. Right.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. Well, we will find out the answer to that question very soon.

JOFFE-WALT: And we will let you know along the way. We're setting up what we hope will be a really cool website where you can track all of this with us. We want you to have all the information we have. So we're going to make it so that you can log in to our toxic asset account, to our Mission Peak Capital account, and see all of our financial statements and the prospectus from the toxic asset and whatever else you want to see. Everything we get, we will put up there. And Wit and his guys also wrote up this really nice summary of what it is that we own.

KESTENBAUM: And we're also - we're putting together an interactive map where you can see the mortgages in the bond, how many are in each state and what's happened to them over time. We're also working on a video. And that's all going to go up on the web on Friday. And we'll send out a note on Twitter when the web stuff is up. But we wanted you, our podcast listeners, to be the first to meet our toxic asset.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And we're going to do more stories about it. And we'd love your help. We actually really want to track down some of the homeowners and possibly, you know, some of the other investors who have owned this bond. So that's all going to come your way in the next few months. We'll let you know what we're looking for. But before we go, David, there is one more question, an important question that we asked Wit's colleagues, Rob and this guy Slim (ph), about before we left.

So, Slim, which song did we just buy?

SLIM: Oh, let's see. Probably "The Gambler," because...

JOFFE-WALT: "The Gambler," really?

SLIM: Probably. Let's go confirm with Rob. But yeah, we bought it for such a cheap price that, yeah, it's likely that, you know, it's no one to hold them, no one to fold them. That's the key.

JOFFE-WALT: We go consult with Rob in the bond cave.

SLIM: You got a song request. Is this "The Gambler" we just sold them, do you think?

ROB: I don't think it's "The Gambler." Where's the song board?

JOFFE-WALT: Rob and Slim spent a long time in front of the song board. It's really cute. Like, they take it very seriously. Because none of the songs that they have on song board really exactly match our bond.

ROB: It's not mid-credits. It's pretty bad credit. It is getting principal. It's floating.

SLIM: Well, we can make up a new song. That's the great thing about these - classifying it by songs.

ROB: It's bad credit.

SLIM: I mean, Michael Jackson's I'm - you know, I'm "Bad." Is that what this bond would be singing right - running from - Against...

ROB: "Against The Wind."

SLIM: ...The Wind by Bob Seger? But let's - but what? - I mean, why is it really "Against The Wind" though?

ROB: Goodness gracious. I think we need "Highway To The Danger Zone."

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE")

KENNY LOGGINS: (Singing) Revvin' up your engine, listen to her howling roar. Metal under tension, beggin'...

KESTENBAUM: All right, podcast listeners, we have a song. We need a name, though. Chana has been calling our toxic asset Dizzy (ph), like, DZ...

JOFFE-WALT: DZ, yeah.

KESTENBAUM: ...For the whole danger zone thing. But we think you can do better. So please send us your suggestions. We're going to put them to a vote and pick the winner. Send us email at planetmoney@npr.org.

JOFFE-WALT: Or you can post them on our blog, npr.org/money. We want to do a big thank you to the guys at Mission Peak Capital for all their help with this. They spent two very long days with us trying to buy our toxic asset. And they've spent many, many more hours helping us put together all the data and all this stuff for the web - Wit and Steph (ph) and Rob - who needs a haircut - and Slim, who needs to learn how to sing for the mic. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening now.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE")

LOGGINS: (Singing) ...Danger zone. You'll never say hello to you until you get it on the red line overload. You'll never know what you can do until you get it up as high as you can go.

**faster whisper:**
All right, so how much do we owe you?
All right, you guys each owe me $202.
All right.
Pay up.
No change?
Even?
$202?
$202.
There's no change.
I don't remember what the change was.
Can I get a receipt?
Can I get a receipt for this?
$40, $60, $80, $100.
I'll send you an email.
I'm going old school and paying by check.
$20, $40, $60, $80, $200, and $201, $202.
I can give you Canadian.
Here you go.
And he's missing its Adam.
Thank you very much, David.
Count it.
Make sure it's right.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Here you go, Fauna.
Thank you, Adam.
Caitlin, you're dragging over there.
I'm writing a check.
I have to be precise.
$20, $40, $60, $80, $100.
I know.
I should have just texted it to you on my cell phone.
Can you do that?
That's the way.
I'm putting toxic asset as the memo on my check.
Hello, and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
Today is Tuesday, March 9.
I'm David Kestenbaum.
And I'm Fauna Jaffee-Walt.
That was my colleagues Alex, Caitlin, Adam, and you, David.
At the top, forking over $200 bucks you all owed me.
We here at Planet Money have pooled our cash, totaling $1,000,
and gone in on a dubious investment opportunity.
That's head on the show.
First, our Planet Money indicator.
We have a sentimental indicator today.
It is $3.28 trillion.
So that's probably a low estimate.
$3.28 trillion in home mortgages
that got packaged into complicated financial instruments
that nearly brought down the global economy.
This should be making you all feel very sentimental right
about now.
Yeah, so they're called toxic assets.
And you know, we heard a lot about them.
The mortgages in them started going bad.
And these things started going bad.
They're so complicated.
No one could tell exactly what they were worth.
No one wanted to touch them.
No one except us.
We did.
We wanted to touch them, to study them.
We wanted to buy our own toxic asset.
And Hana, I really wanted to own one, like a pet,
because they were so central to this whole crisis.
You know, trillions of dollars of them,
so complicated, so abstract.
And I thought, if we just own one,
then we could get the financial statements.
We can pick it apart.
And it would give us a front row seat
for the last act of this whole financial crisis.
Right.
So we were all really excited about the idea.
And we've been sitting around the office talking about,
you know, who might give us money for this experiment?
I was hoping, David, maybe your parents would fund it.
Not my parents.
Maybe NPR.
Yeah.
No, but eventually we decided, no, it's got to be us.
It's on us.
So you, and Alex, and Caitlin, and Adam, and I,
we all each put in $200 to total $1,000.
And we all agreed, if somehow we end up making money,
we're going to give it all to charity.
So actually, you know, we're really
nothing like normal investors.
We're more like philanthropists.
We have no upside, right?
We have no possibility for an upside.
We can only lose money.
All right.
So it is on.
We've got the will.
We've got the $1,000.
Now we just have to buy one.
Turns out that is not easy at all.
You need to know a guy.
And David, you knew a guy.
If you've been listening to this podcast for a while,
you may remember Whit Solberg.
He was a Wall Street guy.
He'd gone home to Kansas City to set up shop there.
He started a small company called Mission Peak Capital.
He's been helping tiny community banks that
got stuck with these toxic assets
figure out what it is they own.
And recently, he's been buying some toxic assets also.
And he said, sure, come on down.
I'll help you out.
So we did.
This is it?
Yeah.
Hey, Hannah?
Yeah?
I forgot my checkbook.
I got you.
All right.
So David, you took me to Kansas City
to what feels like an abandoned alley.
There's no one around.
It's like an unmarked brick building.
I feel like we're buying drugs.
Wait, this is really it just in one
of these little buildings?
Yeah, it used to be a barbershop, I think.
We go upstairs, and it looks a little more legit up there.
There's maybe a dozen guys in a big open office.
There's whiteboards with numbers and lists of bonds.
And each desk has several computer monitors,
sort of strewn empty bags of chips
and with Snapple bottles and papers.
And there's a tube of toothpaste on one guy's desk
and chewing tobacco.
Yeah, they spit the chewing tobacco out
into the Snapple bottles.
That's how it works.
That would be Wit, Wit Solberg.
And he's awesome.
He's sort of this all over the place guy.
He's always telling you several different things at once.
And just getting him to sit down and say his name
and title is tough.
OK, so we.
What's your name?
OK, that's a good point.
You remember that?
Yeah, I remember that.
So my name's Wit.
So Wit tells us, here's how the day is going to work.
He's going to start by checking his email,
because brokers in New York, they
send him emails about what bonds are for sale today.
Bonds is code for toxic assets.
And he's going to look at the toxic assets, the bonds,
analyze them, and he's going to help us choose one he
thinks we should spend our $1,000 on.
And this, David, this is the moment
that I sort of realize I have no idea what I'm looking for.
Like, I don't know, what are we looking for?
What am I trying to buy?
This is actual money in my pocket.
And Wit kind of answers these questions in the way
that he answers everything with a metaphor.
He says, it's OK, just think of it
like you're a farmer at an auction buying a cow.
We've got the big black Angus cow that everybody wants.
We're not buying that cow because it's too expensive.
We want the cow that kind of got a wounded leg,
but she might produce a few more calves for us and is cheap.
And nobody else knows that she's
got a couple more years in her.
And that's what we're after.
So it's sort of like you spend $1,000 on the cow.
And if you can make enough milk from that cow
or get enough offspring from the cow
that when you sell that stuff, you get $1,000,
then you're good.
And if you can sell it for more, then you've made money.
So Wit takes us to his desk.
He's got three computer monitors there.
And he shows us the emails he's got about the bonds that are
for sale from all the guys in New York.
Bobby sends a lot of email.
And Cliff, and Dwayne, and Adam, and Cliff again,
and Chris, and you know.
But you try to.
These are guys that you trust.
They're guys that sell bonds.
And I love the emails.
They have these subject lines like, super senior steal.
Another one says, cheaper.
And then Wit picks one that he thinks looks promising.
He wants to spend some time analyzing.
And you and I, we just go with that.
And then he and his guys set out to analyze it.
Now remember, there are thousands of mortgages
in one of these toxic assets.
So actually, if you got a mortgage in the last 10
years, it's possible we were looking at your mortgage.
It's possible your mortgage was in here.
And it's very likely your mortgage
is in some toxic asset.
Some toxic asset somewhere.
So Wit and anyone else who wants
to figure out how much one of these things
might be worth, they need to know
what are these mortgages?
Who made the loans?
Where are the houses?
Are people making their mortgage payments?
And that is where Brandy comes in,
the model, the computer model.
So the wife, Wit's wife.
The model is named after his wife, Brandy,
who built the thing.
And so for the next couple of hours,
his guys are analyzing these bonds.
And Wit is walking around the office,
leaning over his staff saying things like,
what's Brandy telling you here?
And wow, look at Brandy's law severity there.
Or remember to balance what Brandy's saying
against how realistic it really is.
And Wit makes his way over to one of his staff,
an analyst whose name is Rob.
And Rob works often in this back office
that one guy called a bond cave.
Like, Rob, get back to your bond cave.
And Rob kind of looks like he stuck his finger
in a light socket.
He's sort of, he's both tired
and keyed up at the same time.
And Wit is standing behind him
looking over his shoulder.
Are you working on your omelet, Rob?
Keep working on your omelet.
They go back and forth for a while about the omelet.
And at some point I realize,
oh, they're not talking about eggs.
They're talking about a bond, a toxic asset.
Yeah, so apparently omelet is an acronym
for option mortgage loan trust.
And Rob says to Wit, I like this one.
And Wit tells us we should like it too.
And we say, okay, we like it, yeah.
And now we start talking about price.
And this is the first bit of information
that really blows me away about this whole process.
So Wit tells us we should bid,
we should offer a half a cent on the omelet,
as in one half of one penny on the dollar.
So less than 1% of what someone originally bought it for it,
say the peak of the housing market.
So of course they're not talking about
spending just pennies.
They're talking about spending thousands of dollars.
But it's a way of them saying
it's a fraction of the full $1.
So Wit picks up the phone and he calls Cliff,
who is one of the brokers who sent those emails.
And he says to Cliff,
we'll bid a half a cent on the omelet.
And Cliff says, okay, let me check with whoever's
selling it and I'll get back to you.
So he hangs up the phone and we wait.
And then finally Cliff calls back.
Hey, Cliff.
Hey.
What's happening?
You know that omelet bond?
Yeah.
They're singing high teens on that.
That's bull****.
That's ridiculous.
Wait, so what happened with the omelet?
Somebody bought it for high teens?
That's what they're telling the trader.
And you bid half a cent?
Yeah.
So there's real disagreement about what these things are worth.
There's huge disagreement.
I mean, honestly, this is not uncommon.
So, Hana, we got outbid by someone who is offering 30 times what we offered.
And so this is why,
I mean, you'll remember these toxic assets were a problem in the first place
because no one could figure out what 3000 mortgages bundled into this
complicated structure was worth,
you know, now that the mortgages were going bad.
And now these things are starting to move.
People like Wit think they might have an idea of what they're worth
and they're buying and selling them.
But this is still a huge problem.
There's no consensus on what some of these things are worth.
They're not worth the full dollar anymore.
They're not worth nothing.
But so it's somewhere in between zero and everything.
And also, I mean, even if you want to find out more information,
like if you want to find out, okay, who made the mortgage loans to all these people,
a lot of times you can't because they don't exist anymore.
Companies like Countrywide have just gone away.
And then you say, okay, well,
what about the people who are collecting payments from all of the people who pay the mortgages?
So people who manage the mortgage payments,
they're called servicers.
And we sit down with Wit and we're looking at this one bond and saying,
okay, who are the servicers on this thing?
There's a master servicer who's the master in charge.
And then everybody else is sort of these subservicers that collect the payment.
And you got Greenpoint Mortgage, American Home Mortgage,
Aurora, Countrywide Home Loan Servicing,
they call these GMAC Mortgage, Residential Funding Company, LLC, IndyMac.
So half of these people that were responsible for collecting payments and monitoring this,
just vaporized.
They're gone.
They're responsible, you know, ultimately to the master servicer,
but the master servicer is gone.
AMBAC is in this.
This has got everybody.
This is like a convention of problems.
And, Hannah, even if we had that information,
these bonds are still incredibly difficult to sort out.
Each one is different.
It has this complicated structure.
So we noticed there's this white board in the corner of their office
and there's a bunch of song names on it.
And we asked about it and it turns out that this is to help them keep track
of all of the different kinds of bonds.
They're so complicated and they all have different characteristics.
So they use these songs to associate them with different kinds of bonds.
And so Rob, the guy who looks like he's been electrocuted from the bond cave,
he comes out of his bond cave and he reads that list.
All right, so what do we have at the top here?
Up.
This is our credit I.O. that is a floating rate coupon.
It is, we have classified it as the gambler.
It's, it's, roll the dice.
Who knows?
I think we can go to the next one.
What is it?
This is the credit I.O. that has a fixed rate coupon.
So a little more certainty because you actually know what you're getting
each month.
No principal still.
Still credit I.O.
And that is It's Tricky.
Which?
By Run DMC.
By Run DMC.
They also have mid credit I.O. with good value.
The song for that is Johnny Come Lately.
The high factor support is OPP.
Yeah, you know me.
Apparently that one is because it feels like you're stealing other people's property.
So we get to Witt at 8 in the morning and by 1 o'clock we still have not got our toxic asset.
And not because we've been screwing around with music the whole time.
Brandy the model has been working very hard, analyzed tons of bonds.
But it seems like it's actually just really hard to find one that you can get cheap
and still seems like it'll survive long enough for you to make some money.
Still seems like it has some life in it.
So 1 32 o'clock we find this one toxic asset Witt gets excited about because she's mysterious.
He doesn't quite understand what's going on.
And he actually stands up at the whiteboard to write out just all the details.
All the people who made the loans.
All the other investors and just to try to understand it just so that he can understand it.
And as he's doing that he kind of starts to guess at who the people in this bond are.
What their stories are.
Like this guy got a 2.25 million dollar loan.
30 percent motor value.
It's like a seven million dollar house basketball player.
So these are McMansions.
This has more of a McMansion feel to it.
You know the other thing that's interesting here is you have 9 percent in Florida.
And half of all of the loans in Florida went into default.
So they had a guy in Miami you know just giving mortgages out on condominiums.
And you know there they went.
And so one of the things that we're determining here is have the bad left the building
or do the bad still remain in the building.
Rob the purchase.
I have a good feeling about this one.
Do you hear the McMansions thing?
I want this one.
Hanna you know I wanted this one that was filled with mobile homes.
Yeah you told me that modular.
Yeah.
Alright so you're rooting for the McMansions.
I want to own a bunch of mobile homes.
But he said mobile homes are very hard to get.
They haven't studied them at all.
That's what I like about it.
That's what you like about it?
Yeah.
Impossible to value.
I just like that it's unvaluable.
And that in the end we'll find the answer.
So at this point I actually get it.
At this point I actually get for the first time why so many people bought these things
without reading all the paperwork.
Without fully understanding the details about how they're put together.
Because it's so mind numbing you know.
I can see how easy it was to say oh look this is complicated.
But you know it's got a triple A rating on it from a rating agency.
Someone else has done all the work.
Okay let's just buy it.
Let's just buy one.
Right.
It gets a little boring.
You just suddenly look at so many QCIP numbers and LTVs before your eyes kind of glaze over.
And you just think okay this is the one.
It's got a basketball player.
That seems cool.
I'll take this one.
Actually Witt wasn't so sure about the basketball player bond.
Because there wasn't enough data for Brandy to evaluate it.
And the way it works when you try and buy a toxic asset they're only up for
sale for a couple hours.
And in this case the window is running out.
And I was sitting there the whole day like aren't we supposed to be making
a bid on this soon?
Shouldn't we be getting to work on this?
And in this case we have only minutes to make a decision.
And Witt does something that makes me really nervous.
He says print the book.
The book.
The prospectus.
That 600 four page document that describes the bond in excruciating detail.
We're printing out 600 pages of the toxic asset.
The prospectus.
The entire prospectus.
You can take it home with you.
Check bagged.
Yeah.
You just got delivered the first hundred pages.
Yeah.
So we get the.
And as the pages are coming out of the printer I'm realizing I'm staring at a
historical record of the entire financial crisis.
It's all here on these pages.
Vaporized companies.
People struggling to pay their mortgages.
And some horribly complicated logic describing which bondholders get paid
in which order how much and under which conditions.
And Witt hunches over the pages as they come out with three highlighters
and a pen circling stuff in different colors and furiously turning the pages
time running out and then he stops.
There is a hidden time bomb on page 136.
You're laughing.
That doesn't seem like a good sign.
So I guess in the event of insolvency of Lehman Brothers payments
due under the interest rate cap agreement may be delayed reduced or
eliminated.
This is a disaster.
The disaster is the deadly interest rate swap.
You don't need to know what that is.
It's bad.
Suffice it to say I'm not getting my basketball player.
And we go on like this for two days.
We actually had to book a second night of hotels.
But finally we find a really I think beautiful totally toxic asset at
what Witt thinks is a good price.
Thirty six thousand dollars.
That seems like a lot of money.
But the original sticker price was a lot a lot more.
Two point seven million dollars.
Meaning that's how much money in theory is supposed to be coming in
from the margins.
Yeah.
Wow.
So someone originally was someone was holding and expecting to be
worth a lot more money.
Somebody as a human being or an institution had a two point paid
two point seven two million dollars for this within very
recent history and you bought it for thirty six thousand dollars.
That's right.
And now we buy it too.
We buy a piece of that from Witt for one thousand dollars our own
little encyclopedia of the financial crisis.
We have to go down the street to a community bank in Kansas City
to set up an account.
I'm David.
Nice to meet you.
This is Hannah.
Hi nice to meet you.
All right.
We'll come in and I'm actually going to introduce you to
Christy Beidler.
She's going to go ahead and get you all set up and you're
needing to establish an account, correct?
Yeah, we're opening up a toxic asset banking account.
They tell me to stop recording soon after this.
So I do we set up the account and I write a check.
So we just came out of the bag where they did not let us
record but where Hannah you opened up that Planet Money
toxic asset account.
I have the certificate right here.
We're now proud owners of what Witt called garbage.
David we get back to Mission Peak Capital and that's
when I sort of realized like oh now we own we actually
do own a toxic asset.
We own a tiny piece of 2,000 mortgages all across the country
and I'm trying to picture in my head.
Like what does that mean?
Like sort of like we own a doorknob in each and every
house or something here like a few nails in the floor
or something and like a lot of investors like I only
think I really understand what it is.
We bought this week after you bought it after we bought
it and that day we sat down with Witt at the computer
to try and make sense of our toxic asset and we
looked at some of the outputs from the computer model.
The brand what Brandy's telling you here.
Brandy is Brandy's our model and the wife.
Here's a guy who is a two-point he got a loan for
2.4 million dollars.
Now this house is located in Florida and it's a planned
urban development in Sarasota.
All right, pretty nice Sarasota place, right?
You can tell a zip code.
Yeah, there's a zip code.
He owned 3 3 2 3 4 2 4 0 golf course community, maybe
a cul-de-sac something like that.
There's another guy in Sarasota.
There's another guy in Sarasota.
So you can start to get a feel that there was a
guy in Sarasota who had a billboard who gave big
loans and those big loans went into this pool.
This this guy could be in the same cul-de-sac.
Do you actually see these Israel people or do you
look at them as data?
I mean, do you do you feel anything for them?
Do you say that poor guy we you do feel for people
that have gotten loans through these types of
programs you wish that that they could stay in
their house, but in this particular business,
it's a it's a data point also, California,
Arizona, basically in all the worst hit parts of
the country.
We have mortgages and we can't tell individual
names on the data, but we can see the loan
amounts. We can see, you know, here's one person
who got behind on payments and then caught up a
bit and then got foreclosed on almost 15 percent
of the homes in our toxic acid are in foreclosure.
Almost half are behind on their mortgage
payments.
So a lot of people are struggling.
A lot of people have already lost their
houses and a lot more will lose homes in the
coming months.
And and at some point those homes will be
taken over and sold and for investors.
That's the important part.
The bond basically owns the houses, right?
They're the collateral on the loans.
And as those houses get sold to try and get as
much money as possible, they're going to get
sold for a loss because the housing market
has crashed.
And when that happens, when enough houses
get sold for a loss are part of the bond,
our bond dies and we get wiped out.
But until that happens, we get paid a bit
of money every month.
We get a check.
We just got a check for a hundred forty one
dollars and nine cents this month.
And if we keep getting checks, if the bond
survives and we keep getting checks until
July, we break even.
We make the thousand dollars that all of us
put in back.
And if we make it till Thanksgiving, Witt
tells us we could double our money.
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Next month, they sell all the houses and
you get stuck with nothing.
All right.
So so how we do depends on how long the
bond lasts.
And because this is the podcast, we can
actually explain it to you.
It's going to take a minute.
It's going to take a minute.
But we own what's called the B6 class of
the bond.
So basically everyone who buys a piece of
this bond, we're all standing in line to
get paid.
And some people are near the front of
the line.
And then there are people who are near
the back of the line.
And we B6, we are near the back of
the line.
And that is why our part of this thing
is toxic.
There are actually two people behind us
right now.
We're at the B6 class.
Behind us is the B7 investor and the
B8 investor.
And as the houses get foreclosed on,
taken over and sold, then there are
fewer and fewer houses in our bond,
which means less money coming in, less
money to pay out to investors.
And the folks who lose out first are
at the back of the line.
So I like to think of it as like
there's this monster grabbing the
last person in line and eating them.
Right.
So yes.
So bond holder is B12, B11, B10,
B9.
They got eaten.
The monster's like digested them a
while ago.
And the monster is now chewing on
B8.
And he is going to finish eating B8
and then attack B7.
And then he's going to get to us.
So it's really just a question of
when the monster gets to us,
or when enough houses get taken
over and sold for a loss that we
get shut out of the bond payments.
Okay.
So that's the basic structure of
where we sit as an investor in
this bond.
But the bond overall, as we're
getting to know it, there's so
much we can't know about the
bond and we will never probably
figure out.
So we sit with Witt for our last
couple hours and just try to figure
out what it is and what its life
has been.
Who did we just buy this from?
Well, you bought this from me.
And who did you buy it from?
I bought this on an auction
through a California broker dealer.
And you don't know who they
were selling it for?
We do not know.
We just put a bid.
They just put in a bid on our
behalf.
Can you guess who might have
owned this?
What type of place would have
bought this?
Yeah.
A lot of times people were buying
these.
Some people actually sold them
to banks, community banks,
insurance companies, things
like this.
Pension funds?
Might have this been part of
someone's retirement, some
big retirement fund?
That's correct.
And could it also have been
on the books of like the big
banks that we heard about
holding all the toxic assets
like Citigroup and Bank of
America?
And why they would have held
it on their books usually would
have been to redistribute it.
So it might have been held by
small community banks,
insurance companies, pension
funds, or big enormous banks.
That's right.
Or all of those.
That's right.
So now we own part of this
and you do too.
In a bigger sense,
what are we providing?
Are we helping these people?
No.
You're not helping these
people.
If you have any reason
to purchase this product,
the reason is to make money.
Are we helping the people
who owned this stuff that
we bought it from?
You're not doing anything.
There's no
higher purpose to
purchasing these bonds.
But I can't picture in my mind
some small community bank
in Ohio that's been holding
this and does and wishes they
hadn't and now I've just
taken a piece of it off of
their hands.
Loosen them up and made them
made it possible for them.
No, because what would have
happened was that they'd have
to recognize that loss.
99 they bought but they would
have bought it for a hundred
and now they've just
recognized the fact that
they've lost lost 99.
You know someone has to buy it
right?
Well, that's right.
And I don't disagree with
buying it.
That's why we do it.
But we think it's profitable.
Now whether it's whether you
can make a connection that
it's benefiting somebody
directly whether it's the
mortgages or the market.
It will be beneficial for
people who own something
to better understand its
value.
I see.
So what we're actually doing
is we're saying to whoever
holds this you think you
don't know what it's worth
or maybe you think it's
worth whatever and we think
it's worth two cents on the
dollar.
Yeah, you've raised your hand
and you said it's worth a
penny and a half and by the
way, that's better than
nobody raising their hand at
all.
Of course, there could be a
very good reason.
No one is raising their
hands.
Maybe it wasn't worth what
we paid for it.
Maybe it was worth less
than a penny.
Maybe the person who sold
it, you know, good job.
They got rid of it.
Yeah.
Well, we will find out the
answer to that question very
soon.
And we will let you know
along the way.
We're setting up what we
what we hope will be a
really cool website where
you can track all of this
with us.
We want you to have all
the information we have.
So we're going to make it
so that you can log in to
our toxic asset account
to our Mission Peak Capital
account and see all of our
financial statements and
the prospectus from the
toxic asset and whatever
else you want to see
everything we get, we
will put up there.
And Whit and his guys
also wrote up this really
nice summary of what it
is that we own.
And we're also we're
putting together an
interactive map where you
can see the mortgages in
the bond, how many are in
each state and what's
happened to them over
time.
We're also working on a
video and that's all going
to go up on the web on
Friday.
And we'll send out a note
on on Twitter when the
web stuff is up.
But we wanted you, our
podcast listeners, to be
the first to meet our
toxic asset.
Right.
And we're going to do
more stories about it.
And we'd love your help.
We actually really want
to track down some of
the homeowners and
possibly some of the
other investors who have
owned this bond.
So that's all going to
come your way in the
next few months.
We'll let you know what
we're looking for.
But before we go, David,
there is one more
question, an important
question that we asked
with colleagues Rob and
this guy Slim about
before we left.
So Slim, which song
did we just buy?
Let's see.
Probably the Gambler.
The Gambler, really?
Probably.
Let's see.
Let's go confirm with
Rob.
But yeah, we bought
it for such a cheap
price that yeah, it's
likely that, you know,
it's no end to hold
them, no end to fold
them.
That's the key.
We go consult with Rob
in the bond cave.
We've got a song request.
Is this the Gambler
we just sold them,
do you think?
I don't think it's
the Gambler.
Where's the song board?
Rob and Slim spent
a long time in
front of the song board.
It's really cute.
Like they take it
very seriously because
none of the songs
they have on the
song board really
exactly match our bond.
It's not mid-credit.
It's a pretty bad credit.
It is getting principal.
It's floating.
Well, we can make up
a new song, Rob.
That's the great thing
about these Class
Find It By songs.
It's bad credit.
I mean, Michael Jackson,
I'm, you know,
I'm bad.
Is that what this,
is that what this,
is that what this bond
would be singing right?
Against the Wind.
Against the Wind
by Bob Seeger?
Do you, but let's,
but what, I mean,
why is it really
against the wind though?
Goodness gracious.
I think we need highway
to the danger zone.
All right, podcast listeners.
We have a song.
We need a name though.
Hannah has been calling
our toxic acid Dizzy.
Like DZ.
Yeah.
For the whole danger zone thing.
But we think you can do better.
So please send us
your suggestions
we're going to put them
to a vote and pick the winner.
Send us email at
planetmoneyatnpr.org
or you can post them
on our blog
npr.org slash money.
We want to do a big thank you
to the guys at Mission Peak Capital
for all their help with this.
They spent two very long days
with us trying to buy our toxic acid
and they've spent many,
many more hours
helping us put together
all the data
and all the stuff for the web.
Wit and Seth and Rob,
who needs a haircut,
and Slim who needs to learn
how to sing for the mic.
I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Thank you for listening.
