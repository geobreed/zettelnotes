First, we hear from Yvrose Jean Baptiste, the Haitian businesswoman left destitute by the earthquake. When we first met her in February, all she had to her name was a tub of chicken necks she was selling for a few pennies each. Now, she has money in the bank and her own stall in a bustling market. Then: mangoes. Earlier this year on This American Life we told the story of how hard it was to build a little place where farmers could wash and store their mangoes. We thought it would never happen. But -- right after that story aired -- construction began. A local leader even convinced the young men in the village to dig up 27 miles of unused pipe - for free - and move it so that it can supply water to the center.

On today's Planet Money, we revisit two stories from Haiti. Both turned out better than we expected.

First, we hear from Yvrose Jean Baptiste, the Haitian businesswoman left destitute by the earthquake.

When we first met her in February, all she had to her name was a tub of chicken necks she was selling for a few pennies each. Now, she has money in the bank and her own stall in a bustling market. For more on Yvrose, read our post from this morning.

Then: mangoes. Earlier this year on This American Life, we told the story of how hard it was to build a little place where farmers could wash and store their mangoes.

We thought it would never happen. But -- right after that story aired -- construction began. A local leader even convinced the young men in the village to dig up 27 miles of unused pipe, and move it so that it can supply water to the center.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN SILVIA: People who are working are getting more income, and the total hours rising does suggest support for further growth in the economy. So we don't expect a double-dip recession here.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Today is July 2. And that was John Silvia. He's the chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities. He was talking about today's job numbers. And today on the show, one woman unwittingly trades her man for some money. And we tell a story where the moral of the story is that you, Adam Davidson, are wrong.

DAVIDSON: Well, wait a second, Chana. We also explain how you, Chana Joffe-Walt, were wrong, in fact.

JOFFE-WALT: True, but that comes second.

DAVIDSON: All right. We were both wrong. That's all coming up. But first, we welcome Jacob Goldstein with our patented PLANET MONEY indicator.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Hi, guys. Today, I have a little bit of a twist on the indicator. You know, usually I come in here with an indicator that sounds good and then explain why it's actually bad.

JOFFE-WALT: I've been noticing that you do that.

GOLDSTEIN: I do. So today, I'm not going to completely turn around, but I'm going to give you an indicator that sounds really bad, and then I'm going to explain why it's not quite as bad as it sounds.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

GOLDSTEIN: So the indicator is 125,000. That's how many jobs the U.S. economy lost in June.

JOFFE-WALT: That does sound bad.

GOLDSTEIN: It's bad. You know, it's not good. OK. We can start with this. It's definitely not going to be good when I'm done explaining it. But when you dig into the numbers, it's not quite as bleak as it sounds. That's because the loss was driven by the government laying off more than 200,000 temp workers who were hired to conduct the census.

DAVIDSON: All right. We talked about this on the podcast. Those are the census workers who all got hired in April and May. They drove up the job numbers. That was one of those times where we had job increases. And you came in and said, oh, don't get all excited. That's just a bunch of census workers. That was a patented Goldstein switcheroo.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: That's right. So we got to do basically the same thing this time, right? You have to set aside the temp census workers and really look at what's happening in the private sector because private sector jobs are going to be the key engine for any long-term economic recovery. So for June, the private sector added 83,000 new jobs. Given that we've lost about 8 million private sector jobs since the start of the recession, 83,000 is kind of paltry. But, you know, on the other hand, at least we're not losing private sector jobs.

JOFFE-WALT: I am going to call that a ray of economic sunshine.

DAVIDSON: A paltry ray.

JOFFE-WALT: Paltry. Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: It beats pouring rain, right?

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: All right. Thanks, guys.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Onto today's show. So this is something that I actually like about the podcast, that we can kind of update stuff that we've talked about before. And particularly with radio stories, you know, we can - usually we just do a report, and we finish it, and we move on. But of course, in real life that story continues. And a lot of times, what happens after we finish our stories ends up being really interesting.

DAVIDSON: And today we have two great examples of that. We went back and visited two stories, two stories where we did a report on the radio and on the podcast and then went back a few months later and found out that what actually happened was almost exactly the opposite of what we thought was going to happen. Both stories take place in Haiti. The first story is that of Yvrose Jean Baptiste. I have always loved - I think that's my favorite name.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter) You love saying her name. So we met Yvrose Jean Baptiste. We met her in Port-au-Prince, right after the earthquake in Haiti, behind the prime minister's mansion. So she was walking around, carrying her entire livelihood on her head in this huge bucket. She had a huge bucket of chicken necks that she was selling to people who were camped out on this lawn behind the prime minister's place. It had sort of become a tent city. And Yvrose was selling to people living there.

DAVIDSON: And we learned that while Yvrose has always been poor, this was a level of poverty several notches below her pre-earthquake level. Before the earthquake, she was a micro-wholesaler. She'd get a loan from a micro-lender, she'd buy goods in the Dominican Republic and then sell them to shopkeepers in Port-au-Prince.

JOFFE-WALT: What struck us about her, the point of that podcast, was that here is someone with a fifth-grade education, no shop to sell her chicken necks, no car, not even a wheelbarrow, and she has this really complicated business. She borrows money at one rate and lends her goods at another rate. She has to, you know, cross borders and monitor exchange rates between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. She has to keep track of it all.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

DAVIDSON: Do you have a notebook where you keep down, I lent him this, I have this? 'Cause you have to balance so many figures.

JEAN PALEME MATHURIN: She said that she has her book where she have the list of all her clients.

DAVIDSON: Do you have it on you?

MATHURIN: (Non-English language spoken).

YVROSE JEAN BAPTISTE: (Non-English language spoken).

MATHURIN: No, no, no, no.

DAVIDSON: So that was tape from our original story several months ago. And we learned that Yvrose lost almost everything she owned in the earthquake. But she still owed the bank several hundred dollars - money she had no way of getting. She was trying to make money off the chicken necks, but that was just a few-pennies-a-neck profit. She wasn't getting there.

So we were with Jean Paleme Mathurin. He's economic adviser to Haiti's prime minister. He was doing the translating in the tape. And he said that Yvrose helped him think about something in a new way. He's part of the team deciding how to spend the billions of dollars that's flowing into Haiti. And there's all these plans about rebuilding the country in all sorts of ways. And he was thinking, wait a second. There's tens of thousands of people just like Yvrose. Maybe we just need to get them money, get money into their hands.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

MATHURIN: If she were in a better position to do much more business - let's say double the business - it meant that with a little push, how useful could we be?

JOFFE-WALT: Adam, when Jean Paleme said that, it seemed like a really theoretical thing to say. Like, sure, that would be great. We should get some money into Yvrose's hands so she can build a better life.

But amazingly, what happened for this one woman, at least, is that that actually happened. She actually got cash in hand.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. After the podcast - and then we did a version of the story on Morning Edition - we got all these emails and phone calls saying, how can I help Yvrose?

And you know, Chana, this is always a tricky position for a reporter. We very consciously are not in the charity business. That's not our role in the world. If we start getting involved in charity, it'll affect how we report on stories. It'll affect how people tell us their stories. And so we don't want to be a charity service.

But at the same time, if someone wants to help someone, we certainly don't want to get in the way of it. So what we did was we let Fonkoze - this is a micro-lending institution in Haiti - we let them know about Yvrose. They set up an account in her name, and we let listeners know if they wanted to do that, they could send money to Fonkoze and it would get to Yvrose. And...

JOFFE-WALT: They really wanted to.

DAVIDSON: They really wanted to. Fonkoze told us they got lots and lots and lots of checks.

So I was in Haiti recently, and I wanted to find out what happened with Yvrose. How did this all go down? So we met up, and she told me that one day in March she went to her local Fonkoze branch and she withdrew everything.

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Through interpreter) Yeah. I took it in U.S. currency and it was $3,860 U.S.

DAVIDSON: Had you ever seen that much money?

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Through interpreter) No. Yeah. It's the first time I hold this amount of money in my hands, in my hands for the first time. Yes.

DAVIDSON: Three thousand eight-hundred sixty dollars. That is several years' wages for Yvrose. And it actually - her story now helps us think about one of the central problems in development economics. It's this sort of deceptively simple question - when the U.S. government or people in the U.S. or the U.N. or other countries in the world want to help people in poor countries, why not just give the money to the poor people?

JOFFE-WALT: Because Haiti is this place that is full of thousands of foreign NGOs, non-governmental organizations and foreign government agencies. The U.N. has this huge presence there. And their very existence in Haiti assumes that there are better ways to help people than just hand them money, that you should build institutions and you should train people and that, you know, there's all sorts of problems that will probably come when you just hand poor people more money than they've ever had before.

DAVIDSON: But then there's other people who say those NGOs are not so good at handling the money. And those government agencies that give money create bad incentives and corruption, and they waste the money. So yeah, you should just give the money to poor people. If you want to help poor people, give them cash.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So, Adam, what do we have to add to this debate? We have one humble data point. It's definitely not conclusive; do with it what you want to do. But here is a poor woman, Yvrose Jean Baptiste, who was handed not institutions, not training, but cash. So what happened?

DAVIDSON: All right. So I have to say, this particular data point is very positive in the give-money-to-poor-people camp because Yvrose is definitely the most responsible recipient of a windfall I've ever heard of. She was certainly a lot more responsible than I would have been. I've been sort of fantasizing, what if someone gave me 10 years' of wages all at once and...

JOFFE-WALT: What would you do?

DAVIDSON: I'm just picturing all sorts of Apple gear. I think Steve Jobs would be very, very happy.

JOFFE-WALT: You would. You would buy so much Apple gear.

DAVIDSON: But not Yvrose.

JOFFE-WALT: So Yvrose Rose paid off her debt immediately.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Right away, paid off the 700 bucks or so she had on her loan. And she did not use the rest on any indulgences. She did not buy a TV. She didn't buy any new clothes. She didn't even spend it on things that I would not consider an indulgence, like a house. She's still living in that tent in the tent city. She said she doesn't want to waste money on a house. She paid for her four kids to go to school in the countryside. They live there with relatives, so she gave them some money so they could feed her kids.

And the rest of the money she just invested in her business. And she actually took me there and showed it to me.

JEAN BAPTISTE: OK.

DAVIDSON: OK. So this is all yours?

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Through interpreter) All of this.

DAVIDSON: So you have - let's see. You have corn.

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Speaking Creole).

DAVIDSON: ...Beer, hot sauce.

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Through interpreter) Dominican wine.

DAVIDSON: Oh, that's wine.

JEAN BAPTISTE: OK.

DAVIDSON: So before the earthquake, her inventory was just whatever she could carry in her arms and on her head. Now, Yvrose has an actual stand in an outdoor market. Chana, you've been to these markets in Haiti.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. We should say that's a big deal because most people sell their stuff just sitting on a blanket with all the stuff spread out in front of them.

DAVIDSON: It was a huge investment - cost her around 1,500 bucks Haitian. That's around 200 U.S. But having this stand changes everything. She can stock so much more stuff than just what she can carry in her hands. And her customers now know her. They can find her. She's at the crossroads of two paths, which means a lot of foot traffic.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. You showed me a picture. We actually put this picture up on the blog, npr.org/money. It's like a - it has a tin roof that's sort of held up by a couple branches, basically, right? And it's got shelves in the back. It's really well organized. It's nice.

DAVIDSON: So what does a store like this get you? Before the earthquake, she was making, you know, a few bucks U.S. day. Now she makes between 20 and $30 a day.

JOFFE-WALT: Whoa. Really?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, which is - I mean, you know. You've been to Haiti. It's not just more money. This is a different level of living for her and, as she would say, more importantly, for her kids. Like now she doesn't have to pull her kids out of school when she runs out of money or, as sometimes happened, just not feed them if she can't afford food. Now she could even send them to the doctor if they're sick. She told me this story about her aunt who had typhoid fever and was dying. And she was able to pay for her aunt to go get treated in the hospital. And now she's doing OK. So almost everything in her life is so much better now, except for one sort of shocking and upsetting change.

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Through interpreter) Oh, my God. The first thing I did, I went to my husband and say, my honey, look at that. I got that amount of money. Whoa. And I don't know, for a reason or another - I don't know if my husband was getting jealous - he left me suddenly.

DAVIDSON: He left you when you got the money?

JEAN BAPTISTE: (Speaking Creole).

DAVIDSON: So this certainly surprised me. You know, why would someone leave just when the household got a lot more money? She explained that the power shift in the household was just too much for him. And I actually talked to several Haitian friends, and they said, yeah, that doesn't sound too surprising, that Haitian men like to run the household.

She says that now, you know, she's living in this tent, and she doesn't have a man in the house, and she's constantly worried that someone's going to come by and steal from her or do worse, and she won't have someone to fight them off.

JOFFE-WALT: God. That's such a sad ending. So does she feel like it's - it was overall a good thing to get the money?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. She definitely said that overall her life is much, much better. But she's really sad.

JOFFE-WALT: Adam, I'm just remembering when you met Yvrose, you said over and over later that night, you know, that it was just so powerful to you that there is no way that this earthquake would not make her life permanently worse. You were so struck by that.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I was heartbroken, and I was exactly wrong, which I'm - you know, which is good. I'm very glad I was wrong about that.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Now on to our second story, where you were happy to be proven wrong that things didn't turn out as bad as we thought.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I'd say this one you got more wrong than I did.

JOFFE-WALT: That's true. This is more my bad than yours. OK. So here it goes. Regular listeners may remember this guy.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

JOFFE-WALT: Well, first of all, what do you what do you sell specifically?

JEAN MAURICE BUTEAU: Well, we export mangoes. Mango is the No. 1 agricultural export from Haiti.

JOFFE-WALT: Are you Mr. Mango?

BUTEAU: That's what they call me. Just people started calling me like that.

DAVIDSON: Jean Maurice Buteau - another great Haitian name. Jean Maurice, Mango Man, had a problem. He is an exporter of mangoes. He's trying to sell them to the U.S. And people in the U.S. really want his mangoes. He - they would buy a lot more of them. But he gets his mangoes from poor mango farmers in poor Haitian villages.

And those poor mango farmers store the mangoes under their beds or outside in the sun where they get rained on. They carry them around in sacks on the sides of donkeys. They get all bruised and scratched and beat-up and not suitable for export to America.

JOFFE-WALT: So we did this story for "This American Life" and for the podcast about the effort to solve this problem, just a simple idea to solve this problem - to build a center where farmers in one area could bring their mangoes, and they could wash them at the center, and - this is important, too - they could store them in crates so they wouldn't get those bruises or marks. And the idea was this would be good for Jean Maurice, but it would also be good for the farmers, too, 'cause they could make more money.

DAVIDSON: And the story was about how even though all the Haitian farmers wanted this center, the Haitian mango exporter wanted the center; all these NGOs and even the U.S. government were committed to building the center, and yet the center never got built.

JOFFE-WALT: And we followed this. Our story ended with, after a year and a half of trying to make this center happen, one of the NGOs quit, just - well, the U.S. actually cut their funding.

DAVIDSON: Actually, Chana, do you have the original script from the story?

JOFFE-WALT: No.

DAVIDSON: I know you do 'cause you showed it to me. So why don't you read the last line?

JOFFE-WALT: All right, fine. OK. So the last line of that story went something like this. The two Marche staff - that's the NGO - the two Marche staff we met left Haiti a couple of weeks ago. Mango season has opened without crates. And this, of course, is how you can continue to have 10,000 NGOs in a country that keeps getting poorer.

DAVIDSON: So now, Chana, we finished this story about the Haitian mango processing center that would never be built on a Friday. And we sent Jean Maurice an email saying, hey, you got to listen for yourself over the weekend. And he responded after we finished the story saying, oh, good news. They're going to open the mango center on Monday. And I remember you and I going, yeah, right they are.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, but you can't tell that story - because in our defense, I mean, Jean Maurice had been saying this exact same thing for months. The first time I met him - you know, right after the earthquake, I talked to Jean Maurice, and he was saying they were going to break ground on the center the following Monday. I thought it was, like, something that was just about to happen.

A few weeks later, in March, I checked in with him, and they were going to break ground on the following Monday. There were, like, 10 Mondays when they were going to break ground.

DAVIDSON: I kept - I keep remembering these times you would come up to me and say, hey, good news. They're going to open the center on Monday. And eventually, it just became a joke between us. Oh, this Monday they're going to open the center. And they never opened the center.

JOFFE-WALT: It's so crazy. It happened two days after I went on national radio saying that the project was never going to happen.

(SOUNDBITE OF MOTORCYCLE RUMBLING)

DAVIDSON: Chana, I can say I saw it with my own eyes. It is true. Caitlin Kenney, our fabulous producer, and I went to Casale, the village that we profiled about 40 minutes north of Port-au-Prince. And we saw it with my own eyes, the actual early stages of construction on the mango processing center. I ran into Kosik Marco (ph). You remember him, of course, Chana.

JOFFE-WALT: I do. He's like the local - sort of the local mayor.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, the local leader. And he was probably the single most powerful advocate for this mango processing center. He worked so hard for a year and a half to try and make this thing work.

And he was telling me that after dreaming about it, working for it, one day a few weeks ago, he was there, and these trucks pulled up, and these engineers came out, and they started drawing lines in the sand. And then workmen came out with pickaxes and started breaking the ground, literally.

What did it feel to see that? Did it feel like - you're smiling so big. Did it - you felt it, like, in your chest?

KOSIK MARCO: (Through interpreter) It's true. It's true. It's like - I was like that guy that never drinks water, like, for, like, two or three days and finally have a glass of water, cold water and finally was like, oh. The water just, like - they get - I drink the water, and it get inside of me, like real dry and everything.

DAVIDSON: So Chana, once again, we were happily, very happily, very wrong. The center is being built.

JOFFE-WALT: We were not wrong that the NGO went away, right? They're gone. Marche is gone.

DAVIDSON: Yes. Marche does not exist. Although, I will say, CHF, which was another one of the NGOs working there, an American NGO - they did do their part. They did follow through. They got their job done. They're in charge of building the physical center, hiring the construction crew and the engineers.

But Marche, the one that no longer exists, the NGO that whose funding was pulled by the U.S. government - they were supposed to do all this other really crucial stuff, like teach the farmers how to properly care for mangoes, how to run the center.

JOFFE-WALT: Which is sort of the most important part once the center is built. And Jean Maurice, Mango Man, told us that he is going to step in. He's going to do that for now. He's going to handle the training and teaching of how to work with the mangoes and how to pack them and wash them properly.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. By the way, you say wash the mangoes. This is the other major problem with the center right now. The center's main function is to wash mangoes, which means water. You need water to wash mangoes. And Marche, the NGO that doesn't exist, was going to help them with that.

So Kosik Marco took us out to the side of this road. It was so hot, blazing sun. And there's all these, like, 19 and 20-year-old guys working all day long trying to get water.

MARCO: (Speaking Creole).

DAVIDSON: What's your name?

JEAN MONIQUE: Jean Monique (ph).

DAVIDSON: How much is he paying you for this work?

JEAN MONIQUE: (Through interpreter) They don't give me money for that work.

DAVIDSON: Why are you doing it?

JEAN MONIQUE: (Through interpreter) Because it's my neighborhood.

DAVIDSON: Here's the deal - there's a source of water about 27 miles from the center. And there's this old pipe that nobody really uses anymore that goes near the center, but not quite to the center. So what Kosik Marco did was convinced all the young men in the village to work for free for weeks in the miserable, hot sun, digging up 27 miles of pipe and moving it over.

JOFFE-WALT: Whoa.

DAVIDSON: He convinced all the women in the village to cook for those boys who are working in the hot sun.

And you and I - we just talked to Jean Maurice the other day. They've done it now, since - in the couple weeks since I've been back, they've actually finished the work, and they got the pipe to the center. And the center now has water.

JOFFE-WALT: And that was the job that - the NGO would have hired people to do that otherwise.

DAVIDSON: Exactly. And so on the one hand, this was a frustrating story of the U.S. government paying for an NGO to do this thing for Haitian farmers and then the U.S. government at the very last minute pulling funding. On the other hand, the local Haitians, Jean Maurice, Kosik Marco and all these young men and these women, they did it. I mean, it's really sort of an amazing outcome.

Now, I will say Jean Maurice also told us they only have about a third of the crates that they need. So the center will not be fully operational for a while. But at least it'll start in a - he said around four months.

JOFFE-WALT: And he's sounding more reasonable. He's not saying Monday everything is going to happen. He's saying four months. Give him four months.

DAVIDSON: Yes, which, now I think I believe.

All right, Chana, I think that does it for us. That's our Haiti update. As we said, we have pictures on the blog at npr.org/money.

JOFFE-WALT: You can send us email at planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson. Happy Independence Day. And thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
people who are working are getting more income and that this total hours
Rising does suggest support for further growth in the economy. So we don't expect a double-dipper session here
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money, I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Kana Jaffee-Walt. Today's July 2nd and that was John Sylvia
He's the chief economist at Wells Fargo securities
He was talking about today's job numbers and today on the show one woman
Unwittingly trades her man for some money and we tell a story where the moral of the story is that you,
Adam Davidson, are wrong. Well, wait a second, Kana
We also explain how you, Kana Jaffee-Walt, were wrong in fact. True, but that comes second. Alright, we were both wrong
That's all coming up at first. We welcome Jacob Goldstein with our patented Planet Money indicator
Hi guys today. I have a little bit of a twist on the indicator
You know, usually I come in here with an indicator that sounds good and then explain why it's actually bad
I've been noticing that you do that. I do. So today, I'm not gonna completely turn around
But I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an indicator that sounds really bad
And then I'm gonna explain why it's not quite as bad as it sounds. So the indicator is
125,000 that's how many jobs the US economy lost in June
That does sound bad. It's bad. You know, it's not good. Okay, we can start with this
It's it's definitely not gonna be good when I'm done explaining it
But when you dig into the numbers, it's not quite as bleak as it sounds
That's because the loss was was driven by the government laying off more than
200,000 temp workers who were hired to conduct the census. All right, we talked about this on the podcast
Those are the census workers who all got hired in April and May. They drove up the job numbers
That was one of those times where we had job
Increases and you came in and said I don't get all excited. Those are just a bunch of temp census workers
That was a patented Goldstein switcheroo. That's right
So we got to do basically the same thing this time, right?
you have to set aside the the temp census workers and really look at what's happening in the private sector because
Private sector jobs are going to be the key engine for for any long-term economic recovery
So for June the private sector added 83,000 new jobs
Given that we've lost about 8 million private sector jobs since the start of the recession
83,000 is kind of paltry, but you know on the other hand at least we're not losing private sector jobs
I am going to call that a ray of economic sunshine a paltry
Pouring rain
Okay on to today's show
so this is something that I actually like about the podcast that we can kind of update stuff that we've talked about before and
Particularly with radio stories, you know, we can usually we just do a report and we finish it and we move on but of course in real
life that story
Continues and a lot of times what happens after we finish our stories ends up being really interesting
And today we have two great examples of that
we went back and visited two stories two stories where we did a report on the radio and on the podcast and then
Went back a few months later and found out that what actually happened was
Almost exactly the opposite of what we thought was gonna happen both stories take place in Haiti
The first story is that of Yves Rose Jean-Baptiste. I've always loved I think that's my favorite
So we met Yves Rose Jean-Baptiste we met her in Port-au-Prince
Right after the earthquake in Haiti behind the prime minister's mansion
So she was walking around carrying her entire livelihood on her head in this huge bucket
She had a huge bucket of chicken necks that she was selling
To people who were camped out on this lawn behind the Prime Minister's place
It had sort of become a tent city and Yves Rose was selling to people living there
And we learned that while Yves Rose has always been poor
This was a level of poverty several notches below her pre-earthquake level before the earthquake. She was a micro wholesaler
She'd get a loan from a micro lender
She'd buy goods in the Dominican Republic and then sell them to shopkeepers in Port-au-Prince
What struck us about her the point of that podcast was was that here is someone with a fifth grade education
No shop to sell her chicken necks. No car not even a wheelbarrow and she has this really complicated business
She borrows money at one rate and lends her goods at another rate
She has to you know cross borders and monitor exchange rates between Haiti and the Dominican Republic
She has to keep track of it all. Do you have a notebook where you keep down?
I lent him this I have this because you have to balance so many figures
She said that she has she has her book where she have the list of all her clients. Do you have it on you?
So that was taped from our original story several months ago and we learned that Yves Rose lost almost everything
She owned in the earthquake, but she still owed the bank several hundred dollars money
She had no way of getting she was trying to make money off the chicken necks
But that was just a few pennies a neck profit. She wasn't getting there
So we were with Jean Palin Maturon. He's economic advisor to Haiti's prime minister
he was doing the translating in the tape and
He said that Yves Rose helped him think about something in a new way
He's part of the team deciding how to spend the billions of dollars that's flowing into Haiti and
There's all these plans about rebuilding the country in all sorts of ways and he was thinking wait a second
There's tens of thousands of people just like Yves Rose
Maybe we just need to get them money get money into their hands if
She were in a better position to do much more business. Let's say double the business
It's mean that with a little push
How useful would we be?
Adam when Jean Palin said that it seems like a really
Theoretical thing to say like sure that would be great. We should get some money into Yves Rose's hands
So she can build a better life
But amazingly what happened for this one woman at least is that that actually happened?
She actually got cash in hand
Yeah after the podcast and then we did a version of the story on morning edition
We got all these emails and phone calls saying how can I help Yves Rose and
You know kind of this is always a tricky position for a reporter
We very very consciously are not in the charity business
That's not our role in the world if we start getting involved in charity. It'll affect how we report on stories
It'll affect how people tell us their stories and so we don't want to be a charity service
But at the same time if someone wants to help someone we certainly don't want to get in the way of it. So
What we did was we let
Funko's a this is a micro lending institution in Haiti. We let them know about Yves Rose
they set up an account in her name and we let listeners know if they wanted to that they could send money to
Funko's a and it would get to Yves Rose and
They really wanted to they really wanted to we think Funko's they told us they got lots and lots and lots of checks
So I was in Haiti recently and I wanted to find out what happened with Yves Rose
How did this all go down? So we met up and she told me that one day in March
She went to her local Funko's a branch and she withdrew
everything
Yeah, I took it in on US currency and it was
Three thousand eight hundred and sixty dollar US had you ever seen that much money? No
She has the first time I hold this a month of money in my hands in my hands for the first time
three thousand eight hundred and sixty dollars that is several years wages for Yves Rose and
It actually her story now helps us think about one of the central problems in development economics
It's this sort of deceptively simple question when the US
Government or people in the US or the UN or other countries in the world want to help people in poor countries
Why not just give the money to the poor people because Haiti is this place that is full of thousands of foreign
NGOs non-governmental organizations and foreign government agencies the UN is a huge presence there and
their very existence in Haiti assumes that there are better ways to help people than just hand them money that you should build
Institutions and you should train people and you and that you know
There's all sorts of problems that will probably come when you just hand poor people more money than they've ever had before
But then there's other people who say
Those NGOs are not so good at handling the money and those government agencies that give money
Create bad incentives and corruption and they they waste the money
So yeah, you should just give the money to poor people if you want to help poor people give them cash
Okay, so Adam, what do we have to add to this debate? We have one humble data point
It's definitely not conclusive do with it what you want to do
But here is a poor woman if Rose John Baptiste who was handed not institutions not training but cash
So what happened? All right
So I have to say this particular data point is very positive in the give money to poor people
Camp because Eve Rose is definitely the most responsible recipient of a windfall. I've ever heard of
She was certainly a lot more responsible than I would have been. I've been sort of fantasizing
what if someone gave me ten years of wages all at once and
I'm just picturing all sorts of Apple gear. I think Steve Jobs would be very very happy
But not Eve Rose
So Eve Rose Eve Rose paid off her debt immediately
yeah, right away paid off the 700 bucks or so she had on her loan and
She did not use the rest on any indulgences. She did not buy a TV. She didn't buy any new clothes
She didn't even spend it on things that I would not
Consider an indulgence like a house. She's still living in that tent in the tent city
She said she doesn't want to waste money on a house
She paid for her four kids to go to school in the countryside
They live there with relatives so she gave them some money so they could feed her kids and the rest of the money
She just invested in her business and she actually took me there and showed it to me
Okay, okay, so this is all yours
All of this so you have let's see you have corn
Your beer
hot sauce
Dominican wine. Oh, that's wine
So before the earthquake her inventory was just whatever she could carry in her arms and on her head now
He rose has an actual stand in an outdoor market kind of you've been to these markets in Haiti, right?
It's a big deal because most people sell their stuff just sitting on a blanket with all the stuff spread out in front of them
It was a huge investment cost around 1,500 bucks Haitian. That's around 200 us
But having this stand changes everything she can stock so much more stuff than just what she can carry in her hands
And her customers now know her they can find her
She's at the crossroads of two paths, which means a lot of foot traffic
But you showed you showed me a picture we actually put this picture up on the blog npr.org slash money
It's like it has a tin roof that sort of held up by a couple branches basically, right?
And it's it's got shelves in the back. It's really well organized. It's nice
So what does a store like this get you before the earthquake? She was making you know a few bucks us a day
Now she makes between 20 and 30 dollars
Yeah, which is I mean, you know, you've been to Haiti it's not just more money
This is a different level of living for her and as she would say more importantly for her kids
like now she doesn't have to pull her kids out of school when she runs out of money or
Has sometimes happened just not feed them if she can't afford food now
She could even send them to the doctor if they're sick
She told me this story about her aunt who had typhoid fever and was dying and she was able to pay for her
Aunt to go get treated in the hospital and now she's doing okay. So almost everything in her life is so much better now
Except for one sort of shocking and upsetting change
Oh my god
The first thing I did I went to my husband and see my look at that
I got that amount of money. Whoa, and I don't know for a reason or another
I don't know if my husband was getting jealous. He he left me
suddenly
He left you when you got the money
We must kill a cobbler
This certainly surprised me. Why would someone leave just when the household got a lot more money?
She explained that the power shift in the household was just too much for him
And I actually talked to several Haitian friends and they said
Yeah, that doesn't sound too surprising that Haitian men like to run the household
She says that now, you know
She's living in this tent and she doesn't have a man in the house and she's constantly worried that someone's gonna come by
And steal from her or do worse and she won't have someone to fight them off. Yeah, that's such a sad ending
So does she feel like it's it was overall a good thing to get the money?
Yeah, she definitely said that overall her life is much much better, but she's really sad
Adam I just remembering when you met you've rose you said over and over later that night
You know that it was just so powerful to you that there is no way that this earthquake would not make her life
Permanently worse. You were so struck by that. Yeah, I was heartbroken and and and and I was exactly
Wrong, which I'm you know, just good. I'm very glad I was wrong about that
Okay now on to our second story where you were happy to be proven wrong that things didn't turn out as bad as we thought
Yeah, I'd say this one
You got more wrong
This is more my bad than yours, okay, so here goes regular listeners may remember this guy first of all
What do you what do you sell specifically? Well, we we export mangoes mango is the number one agricultural export from Haiti
Are you mr. Mango, that's what they call me
Just people started calling me like that
Jean Maurice butto another great Haitian name Jean Maurice mango man had a problem. He is an exporter of mangoes
He's trying to sell them to the US and people in the US really want his mangoes
He they would buy a lot more of them
but he gets his mangoes from poor mango farmers in poor Haitian villages and
Those poor
Mango farmers store the mangoes under their beds or outside in the Sun where they get rained on they carry them around
In sacks on the sides of donkeys
They get all bruised and scratched and beat up and not suitable for export to America
So we did the story for this American life and for the podcast about the effort to solve this problem
Just a simple idea to solve this problem to build a center where farmers in one area could bring their mangoes
And they could wash them at the center and and this is important to they could store them in crates
So they wouldn't get those bruises or marks and the idea was this would be good for Jean Maurice
But it would also be good for the farmers too because they could make more money
And the story was about how even though all the Haitian farmers wanted this center the
Haitian mango exporter wanted the center all these
NGOs and even the US government were committed to building the center and yet the center never got built
And we followed this our story ended with after a year and a half of trying to make this center happen
One of the NGOs quit just well the US actually cut their funding actually kind of do you have the original script from the story?
No, I know you do because you showed it to me. So why don't you read the last slide? All right fine
Okay, so the last line of that story went something like this the two Marche staff
That's the NGO the two Marche staff. We met left Haiti a couple weeks
ago mango season has opened without crates and this of course is how you can continue to have
10,000 NGOs in a country that keeps getting poorer
So now Hannah we finished this story about the Haitian mango processing center that would never be built on a Friday and
We sent Jean Maurice an email saying hey
You gotta listen for yourself over the weekend and he responded after we finished the story saying oh good news
They're going to open the mango center on Monday and I remember you and I going yeah, right they are
Yeah, well you can't tell that story because in our defense
I mean Jean Maurice had been saying this exact same thing for months the first time I met him, you know
Right after the earthquake I talked to Jean Maurice and he was saying they were gonna break ground on the center the following Monday
I thought it was like something that was just about to happen a few weeks later in March
I checked in with him and they were gonna break ground on the following Monday
There were like 10 Mondays when they were going to break I kept I keep remembering these times
You would come up to me and say hey good news
They're gonna open the center on Monday and eventually it just became a joke between us
Oh this Monday they're gonna open the center and they never opened the center
Of course it happened two days after I went on national radio saying that the project was never gonna happen
Hannah I can say I saw it with my own eyes it is true Caitlin Kenny our fabulous producer
And I went to Casale the village that we profiled about 40 minutes north of Port-au-Prince and we saw it
Own eyes the actual early stages of construction on the mango processing center
I ran into Cossack Marco. You remember him, of course, Hannah. I do it's like the local sort of the local mayor
Yeah, the local leader and he was probably the single most powerful advocate for this mango processing center
He works so hard for
Try and make this thing work and
He was telling me that
after dreaming about it working for it one day a few weeks ago
He was there and these trucks pulled up and these engineers came out and they started
Drawing lines in the sand and then workmen came out with pickaxes and started breaking the ground literally
What did it feel to see that did it feel like you're smiling so big did it you felt it like in your chest?
I
Was like that guy would never drinks water like for like two or three days and finally have a glass of water cold water
and finally like whoo the water just like
They get, I drink the water and get inside of me like a wheel of joy and everything.
So Hannah, once again, we were happily, very happily, very wrong.
The center is being built.
We were not wrong that the NGO went away, right?
They're gone.
Marche is gone.
Yes, Marche does not exist.
Although I will say CHF, which was another one of the NGOs working there, an American
NGO, they did do their part.
They did follow through.
They got their job done.
They're in charge of building the physical center, hiring the construction crew and the
engineers.
But Marche, the one that no longer exists, the NGO whose funding was pulled by the U.S.
government, they were supposed to do all this other really crucial stuff, like teach
the farmers how to properly care for mangoes, how to run the center.
Which is sort of the most important part once the center is built.
And Jean-Marie's mango man told us that he is going to step in.
He's going to do that for now.
He's going to handle the training and teaching of how to work with the mangoes and how to
pack them and wash them properly.
Yeah.
By the way, you say wash the mangoes.
This is the other major problem with the center right now.
The center's main function is to wash mangoes, which means water.
You need water to wash mangoes.
And Marche, the NGO that doesn't exist, was going to help them with that.
So Cacik Marco took us out to the side of this road.
It was so hot, blazing sun, and there's all these like 19 and 20-year-old guys working
all day long trying to get water.
You're going to ask him a question.
What's your name?
What's your name?
Jean-Maurique.
How much is he paying you for this work?
How much is he paying Cacik Marco?
Not at all.
They don't give him money for that work.
Why are you doing it?
Because it's the other way.
Because it's my neighborhood.
Here's the deal.
There's a source of water about 27 miles from the center.
And there's this old pipe that nobody really uses anymore that goes near the center but
not quite to the center.
So what Cacik Marco did was convince all the young men in the village to work
for free for weeks in the miserable hot sun, digging up 27 miles of pipe and moving
it over.
He convinced all the women in the village to cook for those boys who were working
in the hot sun.
And you and I, we just talked to Jean-Maurice the other day.
They've done it now since in a couple of weeks since I've been back.
They've actually finished the work and they got the pipe to the center.
And the center now has water.
And that was the job that the NGO would have hired people to do that otherwise.
Exactly. And so on the one hand, this was a frustrating story of the U.S.
government paying for an NGO to do this thing for Haitian farmers and then the
U.S. government at the very last minute pulling funding.
On the other hand, the local Haitians, Jean-Maurice, Cacik Marco and all these
young men and these women, they did it.
I mean, it's really sort of an amazing outcome.
Now, I will say Jean-Maurice also told us they only have about a third of the
crates that they need.
So the center will not be fully operational for a while, but at least it
will start in, he said, around four months.
And he's sounding more reasonable.
He's not saying Monday, everything's going to happen.
He's saying four months.
Give him four months.
Yes. Which now I think I believe.
All right, I think that does it for us.
That's our Haiti update.
As we said, we have pictures on the blog at npr.org slash money.
You can send us email at planet money at npr.org.
I'm Hannah Jaffe-Walt.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Happy Independence Day.
And thank you for listening.
