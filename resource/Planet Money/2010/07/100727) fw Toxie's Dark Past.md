Recently we learned from a group of reporters at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that one of the mortgages in Toxie, our toxic asset, was part of a real-estate scheme being investigated by the FBI. It's a scheme that allegedly involves $200 million in fraudulent loans. So we traveled to Florida to find out how the scheme worked. The reporters there told us it all centered around a man named Craig Adams, who was flipping houses back and forth among a circle of friends and business associates. The people in the circle would buy homes for higher and higher prices, taking out larger and larger loans from the bank and then divide that money amongst themselves.

Recently we learned from a group of reporters at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that one of the mortgages in Toxie, our toxic asset, was part of a real-estate scheme being investigated by the FBI. It's a scheme that allegedly involves $200 million in fraudulent loans.

So we traveled to Florida to find out how the scheme worked. The reporters there told us it all centered around a man named Craig Adams, who was flipping houses back and forth among a circle of friends and business associates. The people in the circle would buy homes for higher and higher prices, taking out larger and larger loans from the bank and then divide that money amongst themselves.

The first person whose home was sold into that circle was Dr. Fred Bloom, who watched the price on his former home rise rapidly for 10 years, before he finally learned the truth.

David Kestenbaum explains a "flop" fraud scheme:

    A "flip" fraud scheme works when housing prices are rising. A "flop" fraud scheme works when housing prices are dropping. Here's a typical scenario:

    Say Chana has a house that is underwater, meaning she owes $800,000 but the market value (if she had to sell it) is only $500,000. David (the fraudulent flopster) approaches her with the following scheme. He proposes arranging a "short sale" of the property. A short sale is where the owner of the home finds a buyer to purchase the house for less than it is worth, and the bank – happy to have this all resolved - agrees to absorb the losses and forgive the loan. But here's the catch: David and Chana arrange to have the house sold to their friend Jacob for less than it would actually sell for if you stuck a sign out front. So let's say they sell it to Jacob for $300,000. They then lie to the bank and say this was the best offer they could get, when really they never had another other offers because the house wasn't actually on the open market.

    After the short sale is complete, Jacob turns around and puts the house, which he got for super cheap price of $300,000, up for sale. A real buyer offers a more realistic price say, $500,000, and Jacob has netted $200,000, which he shares with David and Chana. Assuming the FBI doesn't come by asking questions, everyone makes out, except of course, the bank.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Singing) For sale.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) Who's going to flip it? The Montelongo. Going to flip that bathroom. The money...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LITTLE BOXES")

THE SHINS: (Singing) Little boxes made of ticky tacky. Little boxes on the hillside. Little boxes all the same. There's a green one and a pink one and a blue one and a yellow one. And they're all made out of ticky tacky, and they all look just the same.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today is Tuesday, July 27. And that was a clip from the TV show "Flip This House" you just heard at the top.

JOFFE-WALT: Today on the show, crime and intrigue. We take a look inside what could be a $200 million mortgage fraud scheme. There is drama. There are forgeries, arrests. And there are names like Keyworth and Wexler. Before we get to that, we have for you today, as always, the PLANET MONEY indicator from our blogger, Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - $32 billion. That's how much money that BP says it's expecting to pay for the Gulf oil spill.

JOFFE-WALT: Big number. What does it include?

GOLDSTEIN: So the biggest chunk of it is that $20 billion fund that you remember BP agreed to a while back to pay claims related to the spill. It also includes about 3 billion that the company's already spent on the cleanup. And there is this estimate of other future costs that the company explains. That includes not only the direct response to the spill, but costs of litigation and fines under the Clean Water Act.

KESTENBAUM: So this $32 billion, is that going to be it for BP? They pay this, and they're done?

GOLDSTEIN: It's unclear, actually. In the same paragraph where they talk about how they got to this estimate, they also lay out a couple of assumptions they made - one assumption, that they're going to be able to permanently plug the well in August, and also that they were not, quote, "grossly negligent" in this case. And grossly negligent is a legal definition that could have bearing on how much they'll be on the hook for it. So if either of those assumptions are wrong, they could actually end up owing more.

JOFFE-WALT: So 32 billion seems like a really big number. But is it? Like, does 32 billion actually matter to BP?

GOLDSTEIN: There's actually another piece of news in this release from BP today that I think answers your question in an indirect way. BP said it's going to raise $30 billion by selling assets. So what they're going to do is they're going to sell oil and gas fields. And they'll end up selling about 10% of their assets to raise this 30 billion. So in answer to your question, I mean, yes, it's a big deal, but it's 10% of their assets.

JOFFE-WALT: So 32 billion, significant, but if the number doesn't get any bigger, it's not going to put the company out of business.

GOLDSTEIN: I think that's right.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Thank you, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

KESTENBAUM: All right. On to mortgage fraud. So, Chana, as you mentioned, you and I, we recently found ourselves at what really was a crime scene. And it's a crime scene that, weirdly, we are connected to. So I'm going to give some quick background here. It's going to take about 30 seconds. We here at PLANET MONEY, we bought a toxic asset. We spent a thousand dollars of our own money. We wanted to better understand the financial crisis and watch the recovery. And our toxic asset, it's a bond filled with 2,000 mortgages - 2,000 homeowners who have not been doing so well, not paying their mortgages, a lot of them. So we packed up the toxic asset paperwork into a suitcase. We went to Florida to find out why; that was the last podcast. And that's when we ended up at the crime scene.

JOFFE-WALT: We had asked a local reporter at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune for his help in finding some of the homeowners in our toxic asset. His name is Michael Braga. And Michael Braga found something neither of us were expecting. One of our homes is connected to the biggest story that they have been covering at the newspaper, what might be an enormous mortgage fraud scheme led by a guy that the guys at the paper have been calling the King of the Flip.

MICHAEL BRAGA: He just may be the biggest case of mortgage fraud in U.S. history. His name is Craig Adams, and he engineered more than 80 deals, which he has told the FBI about, that were, in some way, fraudulent. Those 80 deals, properties, were worth about $200 million.

KESTENBAUM: So, Chana, before this, when I heard about mortgage fraud, I always thought of some couple kind of fudging something on their mortgage application. But this is much, much larger.

JOFFE-WALT: No. In Florida, mortgage fraud appears to have been pretty widespread and organized. The reporters at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune have been looking into this one circle led by Craig Adams, the King of the Flip. And it was a kind of fraud scheme based on flipping houses back-and-forth for higher and higher prices, so people taking out larger and larger loans from the bank and then dividing that money up amongst themselves, among the people in the circle.

KESTENBAUM: We are going to look at how this apparently worked by following one house. This is a house on Cove Terrace in Sarasota, Fla. This one is not in our toxic asset, but we have a house down the road that is connected to the very same scheme.

JOFFE-WALT: The story of what happened at Cove Terrace begins with a man who may be the very last person to have truly loved this house, the last person to own it before it was sold into the circle of flippers.

FRED BLOOM: Fred Bloom is my name.

JOFFE-WALT: Fred Bloom?

BLOOM: Fred Bloom. Isn't Dr. Bloom a perfect name for an allergist?

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, you're an allergist?

BLOOM: I am.

JOFFE-WALT: So what's this that we're looking at?

BLOOM: We're looking at my former house, 7685 Cove Terrace, which I lived in for about 10 years - loved the house.

JOFFE-WALT: Dr. Bloom, the allergist, raised his two daughters in this house. And it's a really nice place. It's on a quiet street, on a cul-de-sac. It's got four bedrooms, red tiled roof. It's painted sort of, like, you know, that Florida salmony kind of color. And it has a pool and a boat dock.

BLOOM: And we had a little boat, and my kids enjoyed water skiing and fishing and, you know, family activities. At the time I owned it, there was a two-story family room with windows up above. And you could sit there and watch lightning, and you could watch the sky. Just a warm, warm-feeling room with the big windows and light. So they were good years. Jeez, you got me sort of welling up now.

JOFFE-WALT: Well, it's hard to have your kids grow up, huh?

BLOOM: Exactly. You know, it was a good time in our lives.

JOFFE-WALT: And there, appropriately, are the crickets or the cicadas or whatever they are, right as we get to the drama. The drama began the moment that Dr. Bloom decided to sell this house that he had loved.

BLOOM: It occurred after my wife and I got divorced. And she moved out of town, and I stayed in the house, trying to sell it, because she had half equity in the house. And it didn't sell, and it didn't sell, and it didn't sell. My wife wanted to get another realtor, and we did. And she had the house for, I think, a three-month contract. And then towards the end of her contract, she became very intent on trying to lower the price so we could sell it.

JOFFE-WALT: What'd you think about that?

BLOOM: I wasn't happy about lowering the price, but my former wife was saying, I want my money, and the realtor was saying, let's get it sold. And I wasn't happy about that. I was not happy about lowering the price.

CANDY SWICK: And then we had an offer from Craig Adams.

JOFFE-WALT: This is the realtor, Candy Swick.

KESTENBAUM: Now, we should just point out that this was back in 2000. Craig Adams was not known at this time as the king of the flip or possibly the ringleader of a gigantic mortgage fraud scheme. People called him something else. They called him real estate genius.

SWICK: Craig's offer was very good. It was right on the mark. And when he made the offer, it was a fair price. It was like, this is good. Take it and run. It's been enough time.

BLOOM: And I resisted as long as I could and then decided the fight is over. So I caved in.

JOFFE-WALT: Dr. Bloom sold the house for $600,000, which was much less than he wanted for it. And then a few weeks later, he's at the grocery store shopping, and he runs into a former neighbor from Cove Terrace, and he says, hey, how you doing? How are the new people on the block?

BLOOM: And they told me that my house had sold again. And he mentioned the price of 725. And I was really upset. You know, I said, that's $125,000 more than I got for it. And that was only a matter of a couple of weeks.

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, it was weeks.

BLOOM: It was just a matter of a couple of weeks. Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: You must have been mad.

BLOOM: Yes, I was. I was not happy.

KESTENBAUM: Dr. Bloom had no idea what was going on. And he didn't for 10 years until he gets a phone call from one of the reporters at the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. So the Sarasota Herald-Tribune was looking into what seemed like a lot of illegal flipping around Florida, and Craig Adams' name came up several times, including on the Cove Terrace house. So one of the reporters, Matthew Doig, calls up Dr. Bloom and he says, do you remember the details of selling that house? Thinking Bloom probably won't remember anything - it's been 10 years. But Bloom remembered every detail of the sale. He had held on to this resentment and to this mystery for 10 years. Why did he try to sell - for over a year, try to sell his house for $700,000, eventually have to sell it for 600,000, and then weeks later, with the help of this guy, Craig Adams, it gets turned around and sold for $725,000? Here's that reporter, Matthew Doig.

MATTHEW DOIG: After Dr. Bloom is out of the picture, that house is completely controlled by Craig Adams. And every time it is sold, Adams is representing both the buyer and the seller.

JOFFE-WALT: And that house sold many, many times. And in fact, Dr. Bloom - it looked like he sold the house to Craig Adams. But Craig Adams actually got his friend Steve Wexler to sign for it. So Steve Wexler buys it from Dr. Bloom, and then Steve Wexler sells it to John Keyworth for $725,000, who sells it to Craig Adams, who actually buys it at one point for $1.1 million, who sells it to Kelly West for almost $1.5 million, who sells it again to Charles Scott Abel for close to $2 million.

KESTENBAUM: So it sells five times in four years and basically triples in price.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. And Dr. Bloom, the whole time, is really perplexed about what's happening. He still lives in the neighborhood, and the house just keeps going up in price. But it doesn't look better. It kind of looks worse.

BLOOM: Occasionally, I would drive by the house and drive through the neighborhood, and at various times, the yard was really in disrepair.

JOFFE-WALT: When it was in disrepair, did it look like no one was living here?

BLOOM: Yes. Yes, it looked like it was vacant.

JOFFE-WALT: The house looked vacant because probably most of the people in Craig Adams' circle didn't live in the house. So the way the Tribune lays this out is all these guys were connected to Craig Adams. And the idea here is that with each sale, someone would take out a loan that would pay off the previous loan, and since it was bigger than the last, there would be extra cash to split among the players. So, like, David, if I buy a house for $500,000 and then I sell it to you for $600,000, we use your $600,000 loan to pay off my $500,000 loan, and then we have an extra $100,000 to split between the two of us.

KESTENBAUM: So Chana, even after I learned how this game worked, I still had a lot of questions. Question one - why is the bank letting this happen? If all these people are connected, wouldn't the bank look very, very carefully at this? If you're selling to your friend or your associate or someone you know, you're supposed to declare that to the bank.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, they didn't. They didn't declare it to the bank. That's part of why this is fraud.

KESTENBAUM: OK. Question two - whenever a bank makes a loan - right? - an appraiser is supposed to take a look at the property and do an independent assessment of what it's worth. So shouldn't the appraiser have noticed that house just sold a couple of weeks ago for a lot less?

JOFFE-WALT: So this is hard because it's a bubble, and houses are appreciating like crazy all over Florida. It wasn't, you know, totally weird that housing prices would go up quickly enough for a home to triple in value in four years. In Florida, the bubble was growing really, really fast.

But, yes, the Herald-Tribune has been looking into the appraiser question. They've actually been looking into whether some of the appraisers were in on this whole thing also. And as we know, David, personally, in a lot of the cases, the banks weren't holding onto these loans. They were selling them off as quickly as they could to Wall Street. And Wall Street was packaging them up into complicated bonds, like Toxie, which got sold to investors. So the banks weren't as worried about, you know, how this would all end up.

KESTENBAUM: I have one more question. What the hell were the people in the circle thinking - right? - because at the end of the day...

JOFFE-WALT: Money, money, money.

KESTENBAUM: No, at the end of the day, they've just got a bigger loan than they started with, right? All you do is inflate, maybe, the value of a house. And you take out a bigger loan. You still got to repay that loan.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. I asked that question to Guy Cecala. He's the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.

Was it - was there a plan? Like, in a lot of these scenarios, was there a plan of where this ends?

GUY CECALA: There wasn't a great exit strategy. You know, in hindsight, these weren't geniuses figuring out these plans because they had a lot of pitfalls. Even if home prices were continuing to rise, most of them saw quick money right away and weren't figuring out how it was going to play out over time.

JOFFE-WALT: Right, because the only way that you can - the only end that I can imagine that - where you don't end up having to pay back the loan is that you sell the house to some legitimate, outside buyer who doesn't realize that it shouldn't be that expensive.

CECALA: That's true. But keep in mind, if you're buying a house that's worth 600,000, but you manage to convince the lender that the house is worth 800 or, let's say, $1 million, you're essentially pocketing that difference in the short term. You're basically getting that money yourself.

JOFFE-WALT: But only in the short term. In the end, you still have to pay it back.

CECALA: That's not the way a lot of the people look at it, as paying back. They look at it as, it's a lot of money. I can go spend it. I'll worry about paying it back down the road.

KESTENBAUM: And down the road, we now know, things didn't go so well. In 2007, the Cove Terrace house was owned by yet another associate of Craig Adams. The housing bubble pops. And this guy defaults on more than $2 million in loans. And the bank ends up foreclosing on the house.

JOFFE-WALT: And when that happened, when the foreclosure happened, Candy Swick, Dr. Bloom's real estate agent, happens to get another call from a client interested in the Cove Terrace house. So for the second time, 10 years later, Candy Swick pulls up the Cove Terrace listing.

SWICK: Oh, my gosh.

JOFFE-WALT: What did it look like?

SWICK: It looked like it had been sold every couple years. And I see, Craig Adams, listed and sold. Craig Adams, listed and sold. Craig Adams, listed and sold. Craig Adams, listed and sold. And it's like, this is not right.

JOFFE-WALT: And as for Dr. Bloom, after 10 long years of being furious at Candy Swick for not getting him the higher price, he says he now understands. And he forgives her. And he said he's sorry.

KESTENBAUM: Craig Adams, the king of the flip, he is now an FBI informant, according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. He's helping the feds investigate the circle. There has been one arrest, at least. The closing agent, the person who did a lot of the paperwork for some of Craig Adams' deal, has been arrested. And actually, on the FBI affidavit for that - I was going through it. Going through - it lists a bunch of fraudulent mortgages. One of them is one of our houses in our toxic asset, which is how we got onto this.

JOFFE-WALT: We were so surprised when we learned that. So this kind of scheme happened in Sarasota and other parts of Florida, in California. It happened all over the country. It even has a name. It's called the straw buyer scheme. So in this scenario, Wexler, Keyworth - one of those guys would have been the straw buyers.

KESTENBAUM: The thing I kept wondering about, the more we learned about this was, did it matter? Was this something that caused the bubble? Was this really helping inflate the bubble? Or is the bubble happening and when you have bubbles, you have some people doing fraud along the side?

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, the effect of this kind of fraud is actually really hard to measure. I mean, obviously, it has some local effect. Like, one house shoots up in price, maybe the other houses on the block go up in price. Maybe on the downside, you know, if there's one house in foreclosure that has some effect on the neighbors. But can you see this kind of fraud having a big effect in home prices overall? Like, during the bubble, do you see - can you see Craig Adams in the Case-Shiller housing index? You know, most people have been telling me, probably not. It probably had a much more local impact.

KESTENBAUM: So flipping fraud is probably not happening now anyway because this kind of scheme only works when there is a bubble and housing prices are rising.

JOFFE-WALT: But there is a different kind of scheme that is happening now that people are talking about. During a bubble, there's a flip. After a bubble, there's a flop. And if you want to understand more about how that works, we have something on our blog describing it, npr.org/money. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LITTLE BOXES")

THE SHINS: (Singing) And there's doctors. There's lawyers and business executives. And you're all made out of ticky-tacky. And you all look just the same. And they all play on the golf course and drink their martinis dry. And they all have pretty children. And the children go to school. And the children go to summer camp and then to the university, where we all get put in boxes. And we all come out the same.

**faster whisper:**
Oh, I'm lookin' at a girl, who's gonna flip it?
The Montalongo, gonna flip that bathroom, Lamont and Angelo
Little boxes made of tiki-taki, little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes all the same
There's a green one, and a pink one, and a blue one, and a yellow one
And they're all made out of tiki-taki, and they all look just the same
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt
And I'm David Kestinbaum, today is Tuesday, July 27th
And that was a clip from the TV show, Flip This House, you just heard at the top
Today on the show, Crime and Intrigue, we take a look inside what could be a $200 million mortgage fraud scheme
There is drama, there are forgeries, arrests, and there are names like Keyworth and Wexler
Before we get to that, we have for you today, as always, the Planet Money Indicator from our blogger, Jacob Goldstein
Today's Planet Money Indicator, $32 billion
That's how much money that BP says it's expecting to pay for the Gulf oil spill
Big number, what does it include?
So the biggest chunk of it is that $20 billion fund that you remember BP agreed to a while back to pay claims related to the spill
It also includes about $3 billion that the company's already spent on the cleanup
And there's this estimate of other future costs that the company explains
That includes not only the direct response to the spill, but costs of litigation and fines under the Clean Water Act
So this $32 billion, is that going to be it for BP? They pay this and they're done?
It's unclear, actually
In the same paragraph where they talk about how they got to this estimate, they also lay out a couple of assumptions they made
One assumption, that they're going to be able to permanently plug the well in August
And also that they were not, quote, grossly negligent in this case
And grossly negligent is a legal definition that could have a bearing on how much they'll be on the hook for it
So if either of those assumptions are wrong, they could actually end up owing more
So $32 billion seems like a really big number, but is it? Does $32 billion actually matter to BP?
There's actually another piece of news in this release from BP today that I think answers your question in an indirect way
BP said it's going to raise $30 billion by selling assets
So what they're going to do is they're going to sell oil and gas fields
And they'll end up selling about 10% of their assets to raise this $30 billion
So in answer to your question, I mean, yes, it's a big deal, but it's 10% of their assets
So $32 billion significant, but if the number doesn't get any bigger, it's not going to put the company out of business
I think that's right
OK, thank you, Jacob
Thanks, guys
All right, on to mortgage fraud
So, Hannah, as you mentioned, you and I, we recently found ourselves at what really was a crime scene
And it's a crime scene that weirdly we are connected to
So I'm going to give some quick background here
It's going to take about 30 seconds
We here at Planet Money, we bought a toxic asset
We spent $1,000 of our own money
We wanted to better understand the financial crisis and watch the recovery
And our toxic asset, it's a bond filled with 2,000 mortgages, 2,000 homeowners who have not been doing so well
Not paying their mortgages, a lot of them
So we packed up the toxic asset paperwork into a suitcase
We went to Florida to find out why
That was the last podcast
And that's when we ended up at the crime scene
We had asked a local reporter at the Sarasota Herald Tribune for his help in finding some of the homeowners in our toxic asset
His name is Michael Braga
And Michael Braga found something neither of us were expecting
One of our homes is connected to the biggest story that they have been covering at the newspaper
What might be an enormous mortgage fraud scheme led by a guy that the guys at the paper have been calling the king of the flip
He just may be the biggest case of mortgage fraud in U.S. history
His name is Craig Adams
And he engineered more than 80 deals which he has told the FBI about
That were in some way fraudulent
Those 80 deals properties were worth about $200 million
So, Hannah, before this, when I heard about mortgage fraud
I always thought of some couple kind of fudging something on their mortgage application
But this is much, much larger
You know, in Florida, mortgage fraud appears to have been pretty widespread and organized
The reporters at the Sarasota Herald Tribune have been looking into this one circle led by Craig Adams, the king of the flip
And it was a kind of fraud scheme based on flipping houses back and forth for higher and higher prices
So people taking out larger and larger loans from the bank
And then dividing that money up amongst themselves, among the people in the circle
We are going to look at how this apparently worked by following one house
This is a house on Cove Terrace in Sarasota, Florida
This one is not in our toxic asset, but we have a house down the road that is connected to the very same scheme
The story of what happened at Cove Terrace begins with a man who may be the very last person to have truly loved this house
The last person to own it before it was sold into the circle of flippers
Fred Blum is my name
Fred Blum?
Fred Blum
Isn't Dr. Blum a perfect name for an allergist?
Are you an allergist?
I am
So what's this over here?
We're looking at my former house, 7685 Cove Terrace
Which I lived in for about 10 years, loved the house
Dr. Blum, the allergist, raised his two daughters in this house
And it's a really nice place, it's on a quiet street, on a cul-de-sac
It's got four bedrooms, red tile roof, it's painted sort of like, you know that Florida salmon-y kind of color
And it has a pool and a boat dock
We had a little boat and my kids enjoyed water-skiing and fishing and, you know, family activities
By the time I owned it, it was a two-story family room with windows up above
And you could sit there and watch lightning, and you could watch the sky
Just a warm, warm feeling room with the big windows and light
So, they were good years
You can hear me sort of welling up now
Oh, that's how you tell your kids to grow up, huh?
Exactly, you know, it was a good time in our lives
And there, appropriately, are the crickets, or the cicadas, or whatever they are
Right as we get to the drama
The drama began the moment that Dr. Blum decided to sell this house that he had loved
It occurred after my wife and I got divorced
And she moved out of town, and I stayed in the house trying to sell it
Because she had half equity in the house
And it didn't sell, and it didn't sell, and it didn't sell
My wife wanted to get another realtor, and we did
And she had the house for, I think, a three-month contract
And then towards the end of her contract, she became very intent on trying to lower the price so we could sell it
What did you think about that?
I wasn't happy about lowering the price
But my former wife was saying, I want my money, and the realtor was saying, let's get it sold
And I wasn't happy about that, I was not happy about lowering the price
And then we had an offer from Craig Adams
This is the realtor Candy Swick
We should just point out that this was back in 2000
Craig Adams was not known at this time as the king of the flip
Or possibly the ringleader of a gigantic mortgage fraud scheme
People called him something else, they called him real estate genius
Craig's offer was very good
It was right on the mark, and when he made the offer, it was a fair price
It was like, this is good, take it and run
It's been enough time
And I resisted as long as I could and then decided
The fight is over
So, I caved in
Dr. Bloom sold the house for $600,000, which was much less than he wanted for it
And then, a few weeks later, he's at the grocery store shopping
And he runs into a former neighbor from Cove Terrace
And he says, hey, how you doing? How are the new people on the block?
And they told me that my house had sold again
And he mentioned the price is $725,000
And I was really upset
And I said, that's $125,000 more than I got for it
That was only a matter of a couple of weeks
Oh, it was weeks?
It was just a matter of a couple of weeks, yeah
You must have been mad
Yes, I was, I was not happy
Dr. Bloom had no idea what was going on
And he didn't for 10 years until he gets a phone call
From one of the reporters at the Sarasota Herald Tribune
So the Sarasota Herald Tribune was looking into what seemed like
A lot of illegal flipping around Florida
And Craig Adams' name came up several times
Including on the Cove Terrace house
So one of the reporters, Matthew Doig, calls up Dr. Bloom
And he says, do you remember the details of selling that house?
Thinking Bloom probably won't remember anything it's been 10 years
But Bloom remembered every detail of the sale
He had held onto this resentment and to this mystery for 10 years
Why did he try to sell, for over a year, try to sell his house for $700,000?
And eventually have to sell it for $600,000
And then weeks later, with the help of this guy, Craig Adams
It gets turned around and sold for $725,000
Here's that reporter, Matthew Doig
After Dr. Bloom is out of the picture
That house is completely controlled by Craig Adams
And every time it is sold
Adams is representing both the buyer and the seller
And that house sold many, many times
And in fact, Dr. Bloom, it looked like he sold the house to Craig Adams
But Craig Adams actually got his friend, Steve Wexler, to sign for it
So Steve Wexler buys it from Dr. Bloom
And then Steve Wexler sells it to John Keyworth for $725,000
Who sells it to Craig Adams, who actually buys it at one point
For $1.1 million
Who sells it to Kelly West for almost $1.5 million
Who sells it again to Charles Scott Abel for close to $2 million
So it sells five times in four years and basically triples in price?
Yeah, and Dr. Bloom, the whole time, is really perplexed about what's happening
He still lives in the neighborhood
And the house just keeps going up in price
But it doesn't look better, it kind of looks worse
Occasionally, I would drive by the house and drive through the neighborhood
And at various times, the yard was really in disrepair
When it was in disrepair, did it look like no one was living here?
Yes, yes, it looked like it was vacant
The house looked vacant because
Probably most of the people in Craig Adams' circle didn't live in the house
So the way the Tribune lays this out is
All these guys were connected to Craig Adams
And the idea here is that with each sale
Someone would take out a loan that would pay off the previous loan
And since it was bigger than the last
There would be extra cash to split among the players
So like David, if I buy a house for $500,000
And then I sell it to you for $600,000
We use your $600,000 loan to pay off my $500,000 loan
And then we have an extra $100,000 to split between the two of us
So, Hannah, even after I learned how the scheme worked
I still had a lot of questions
Question one, why is the bank letting this happen?
If all these people are connected
Wouldn't the bank look very, very carefully at this?
If you're selling to your friend or your associate or someone you know
You're supposed to declare that to the bank, right?
Yeah, they didn't
They didn't declare it to the bank
That's part of why this is fraud
Okay, question two
Whenever a bank makes a loan, right
An appraiser is supposed to take a look at the property
And do an independent assessment of what it's worth
So shouldn't the appraiser have noticed
That house just sold a couple weeks ago for a lot less?
So this is hard because it's a bubble
And houses are appreciating like crazy all over Florida
It wasn't, you know, totally weird
That housing prices would go up quickly enough
For a home to triple in value in four years
In Florida, the bubble was growing really, really fast
But yes, the Herald Tribune has been looking into the appraiser question
They've actually been looking into whether
Some of the appraisers were in on this whole thing also
And as we know, David, personally
In a lot of the cases, the banks weren't holding on to these loans
They were selling them off as quickly as they could
To Wall Street, and Wall Street was packaging them up
Into complicated bonds like Toxi, which got sold to investors
So the banks weren't as worried about, you know, how this would all end up
I have one more question
What the hell were the people in the circle thinking, right?
Because at the end of the day
Many, many, many
No, at the end of the day
They've just got a bigger loan than they started with, right?
All you do is inflate maybe the value of a house
And you take out a bigger loan
You still got to repay that loan
Yeah, I asked that question to Guy Sakala
He's the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance
Was there a plan?
Like, in a lot of these scenarios
Was there a plan of where this ends?
There wasn't a great exit strategy
In hindsight, these weren't geniuses
Figuring out these plans
Because they had a lot of pitfalls
Even if home prices were continuing to rise
Most of them saw quick money right away
And weren't figuring out how it was going to play out over time
But because the only way that you can
The only end that I can imagine
That, where you don't end up having to pay back the loan
Is that you sell the house
To some legitimate outside buyer
Who doesn't realize that it shouldn't be that expensive
That's true
But keep in mind
If you're buying a house that's worth $600,000
But you manage to convince a lender that the house is worth $800 or
Let's say a million dollars
You're essentially pocketing that difference in the short term
You're basically getting that money yourself
But only in the short term
In the end, you still have to pay it back
That's not the way a lot of the people look at it
It's paying back
They look at it as it's a lot of money
I can go spend it
I'll worry about paying it back down the road
And down the road, we now know
Things didn't go so well
In 2007, the Cove Terrace House
Was owned by yet another associate of Craig Adams
The housing bubble pops
And this guy defaults on more than $2 million in loans
And the bank ends up foreclosing on the house
And when that happened
When the foreclosure happened
Candy Swick, Dr. Bloom's real estate agent
Happens to get another call from a client interested
In the Cove Terrace House
So for the second time, 10 years later
Candy Swick pulls up the Cove Terrace listing
Oh my gosh
What did it look like?
It looked like it had been sold every couple years
And I see Craig Adams listed and sold
Craig Adams listed and sold
Craig Adams listed and sold
Craig Adams listed and sold
And it's like, this is not right
And as for Dr. Bloom
After 10 long years of being furious at Candy Swick
For not getting him the higher price
He says he now understands
And he forgives her
And he said he's sorry
Craig Adams, the king of the flip
He is now an FBI informant
According to the Sarasota Herald Tribune
He is helping the feds investigate the circle
There's been one arrest at least
The closing agent
The person who did a lot of the paperwork
For some of Craig Adams' deal
Has been arrested
And actually on the FBI affidavit for that
I was going through it
Going through it lists a bunch of fraudulent mortgages
One of them is one of our houses in our toxic asset
Which is how we got onto this
We were so surprised when we learned that
So this kind of scheme happened in Sarasota
In other parts of Florida, in California
It happened all over the country
It even has a name
It's called the straw buyer scheme
So in this scenario Wexler or Keyworth
One of those guys would have been the straw buyers
The thing I kept wondering about
The more we learned about this was
Did it matter?
Was this something that caused the bubble?
Was this really helping inflate the bubble?
Or is the bubble happening
And when you have a bubble
You have some people doing fraud along the side?
Yeah, the effect of this kind of fraud
Is actually really hard to measure
I mean, obviously it has some local effect
Like one house shoots up in price
Maybe the other houses on the block go up in price
Maybe on the downside
You know, if there's one house in foreclosure
That has some effect on the neighbors
But can you see this kind of fraud
Having a big effect in home prices overall?
Like during the bubble
Can you see Craig Adams
In the Case-Shiller Housing Index
You know, most people have been telling me
Probably not
It probably had a much more local impact
So flipping fraud is probably not happening now anyway
Because this kind of scheme only works
When there is a bubble
And housing prices are rising
But there's a different kind of scheme
That is happening now
That people are talking about
During a bubble there's a flip
After a bubble there's a flop
And if you want to understand more
About how that works
We have something on our blog
