    Transcript

That's Max Marion-Spencer in the photo up there. He's 18 and unemployed -- despite having applied for jobs at Quizno's, McDonald's, Arby's, Food Lion and Dollar General.

He's standing next to his grandmother, Alice Terry. She's 62, and works as a high school teacher.

On today's Planet Money, Max and Alice join us to interview for a fake job.

Fake-job title: Human manifestation of an economic trend.

The trend: In the U.S. workforce, teenagers are now outnumbered by people who are 65 or older.

(Yeah, we know Alice isn't 65 or older. And we know that, if Max is still looking for a job, he's counted as part of the workforce. Still, they're a very charming duo.)

Also on the show, we talk to a few economists about this whole situation.

Till Marco von Wachter, an economist at Columbia, tells us about a rather ominous finding from his research: People who start working during a recession are likely to see their incomes suffer for many years -- even after the recession ends.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUMFORD AND SONS SONG, "LITTLE LION MAN")

ALICE TERRY: Hello, and welcome...

MAX MARION-SPENCER: To NPR's PLANET MONEY.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Today is Tuesday, July 20. And that was Alice and Max welcoming you to the podcast. Alice is in her 60s. Max is 18 years old. And on today's show, the two are going to face off in a competition that will determine nothing less than the future of two entire generations. We are pitting young against old on the show today in a battle for jobs in a recession. And here to help me referee this match is NPR's New York correspondent Robert Smith.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Great to be here. Normally, I sit in the opposite cubicle farm from PLANET MONEY, but today I'm sitting in for Alex Blumberg for a couple of weeks.

JOFFE-WALT: And we're very happy to hear you. And Alex is out for a very happy reason. He and his wife, Nazanin, just had a baby boy, Calvin, who we all just met on Skype. He is very cute. He's PLANET MONEY's first human dividend.

SMITH: Congratulations to the Blumberg-Rafsanjani clan, and I'm excited to be here for the world's most uncomfortable job interview coming up for your educational pleasure.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. But first, we need to do our PLANET MONEY indicator. We have Jacob Goldstein here to deliver it.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 5%.

JOFFE-WALT: Five percent - that sounds okay.

GOLDSTEIN: It's not super sexy, I know. But trust me; it's really rich with context.

JOFFE-WALT: As usual.

GOLDSTEIN: Great context today - but first, the not sexy part. Housing starts declined by 5% in June, according to government figures out today.

SMITH: OK. I feel like I've heard this before on the podcast - indicators about weakness in the housing market.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, this is the rich-with-context part.

SMITH: OK.

GOLDSTEIN: So if you look over the course of the past few years, you see what's really a pretty coherent story that plays out across a bunch of different housing indicators, right? So basically, you have the housing bubble popping in 2006 and things falling really sharply for a couple years. Then everything bottoms out in 2009 and starts to come back through the end of last year and into the beginning of this year. And then in the past few months, things have started to fall again. We've seen lots of weakness in housing market indicators.

JOFFE-WALT: But the thing that's consistent is that little bounce that we saw across all those housing indicators was at least partly because the government was doing a huge amount to prop up the housing market. One of those government programs, the homebuyer tax credit - that just ended.

GOLDSTEIN: Well, it's complicated. But the simplest way to say it is it ended at the end of April. So there are a few possibilities when we look now at what's going on. On the one hand, we know that the homebuyer tax credit must have compelled at least some people who were planning to buy a house this summer to hurry up and buy a house this spring before that tax credit expired. So what we could be seeing right now is just a little, like, hiccup, where we have these declines driven by those people who would have bought in the summer but got pulled into the spring. Now, on the other hand, maybe that government program just postponed a more significant decline in the housing market. If that's the case, we could see all these housing indicators continue to decline for a while now. And really, it'll probably be a few months before we can tell which one of these scenarios is playing out.

SMITH: OK. Well, thanks for the hiccups, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So today on the show, we are doing a fake job interview to illustrate a very real economic point. And it's a fact that sort of struck all of us in the office recently. The fact is this. There are now more people past retirement age in the workforce than teenagers, than teen workers. And that's the first time this has happened since at least 1948, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics first started doing this survey. So we thought it was sort of interesting.

Robert, tell them what you said when I told you that.

SMITH: It means there are more people in the workforce who remember the birth of the DMZ than watch TMZ.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

SMITH: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: So we wanted to bring in a representative from each generation for the show today to ask, economically, who is in worse shape? Is it a senior who can't quit their job because they need the money? Or is it a teenager who can't get a job?

SMITH: And we'll talk to an economist that says that one of our job candidates - spoiler alert here - one of our job candidates may be living with the consequences of this recession for a very long time.

JOFFE-WALT: We don't want to psych them out before the interview even starts, so here they are. They're talking to us from Hillsborough, N.C.

MAX: My name is Max Marion-Spencer. I'm 18. And right now for a living, I'm trying to find a job.

TERRY: And I'm Alice Terry. I'm 62, and I am working as an educator at a local high school.

SMITH: And you two actually know each other.

TERRY: Yes.

MAX: I am Alice's grandson.

TERRY: Yeah. I was there when Max was born.

JOFFE-WALT: It makes for a little bit of an awkward job interview.

MAX: Yep.

SMITH: Well, let me tell you a little bit about the job we have here. The official title is human manifestation of an economic trend. So we're going to choose someone to be our generational spokesperson. Are you ready to do this job?

MAX: It sounds like an interesting experience, other than working at a fast-food restaurant or a grocery store.

SMITH: Are those all things you've applied for, Max?

MAX: Yes. Actually, I applied to Quiznos, Wendy's, McDonald's, Arby's, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, Dollar General.

JOFFE-WALT: All turned you down?

MAX: Yeah. I would assume so at this point.

JOFFE-WALT: Aw. So Max is doing a pretty good job at this point, convincing us he is the perfect generational symbol. You know, all those jobs, all jobs that you think of when you think of teenagers applying for jobs, he thought would be easy to get, but he found out that many of them are already taken.

SMITH: But I should say that Alice, his grandmother, is also a near-perfect demographical representative herself. She's a baby boomer. She's nearing retirement, but she's in no hurry to get out of the workforce.

TERRY: I don't think I'm going to ever leave the job world. I honestly don't think so. I don't really have an investment portfolio to fall back on. I'm really grateful that I'm able to work, and I enjoy my job.

JOFFE-WALT: So, Robert, let's just pause the interview for just a couple of minutes because I have sort of a more of an economist's kind of question, which is just, are these two stories really connected? Is there a direct correlation? You know, does Grandma and Grandpa sticking around in the job market mean that there really are fewer jobs for their grandchildren?

SMITH: You're right. We're going to need an economist.

IAN SHEPHERDSON: Here I am.

SMITH: Well, you know, a strong English accent is preferred for this job.

SHEPHERSON: Right. Well, that's good 'cause I've got one of those.

SMITH: This is Ian Shepherdson with High Frequency Economics. He says that having more retirees than teenagers working - it's a striking fact. He admits it. But there are a lot of different trends hidden in this factoid.

SHEPHERSON: It's partly a demographic story just 'cause there are a lot of old - more older people around. But it's also partly an economic story as well because I suspect that quite a lot of these older workers would like to be retired by now. But having seen their retirement accounts stagnating at best over the last decade, maybe they're having to work for longer.

SMITH: And you can't say that that reaction is directly responsible for the drop in teenage employment. The number of teenagers in the workforce has been going down since around 1980, but it really plunged during the recession.

SHEPHERSON: I think a lot of younger people now are recognizing that there are so few jobs around for people graduating high school or even graduating college with a first degree that it doesn't really pay them to dive straight into the labor force now. They're choosing to defer their labor force entry because they know that simply there aren't any jobs around now.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So each generation has their own reasons for getting in and out of the job market.

SMITH: Yeah. It's not like Max and Alice are competing for the exact same job. I mean, she's a teacher, and he's looking for anything he can find, mostly retail work.

JOFFE-WALT: Although, I did talk to a few grandparent-grandchild pairs where it did seem like there was a pretty direct connection. I talked to this one 71-year-old Ohio former police officer who - he retired and left the force but then realized he needed money, so he went back to work. He found a job as a night guard. And when we were talking, he told me, you know, his job is a job that his grandson would probably be qualified for. And his grandson, like Max, can't find work right now.

SMITH: See, normally, it would be so ridiculous to have this conversation because normally, there's enough job growth to give plenty of opportunities for both the young and the old. There's lots of entry-level jobs. That's plenty of jobs for people to stick around. There are new night guardsmen jobs. But, you know, there's also new teachers.

JOFFE-WALT: But this is not a normal time.

SHEPHERSON: The fact is that the number of jobs in the U.S. economy right now is not increasing. So for every older person who would have retired but hasn't, there's an opening there that is not currently available. There really is a - sort of a literal truth to the idea that an older person in a job is keeping a younger person out of a job because we're not seeing that normal expansion in the overall number of jobs available.

SMITH: This is what's referred to, technically, as the cage-match situation. (Imitating wrestling announcer) Two generations go in, but only one generation comes out.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. Well, good luck trying to get this grandmother and grandson to trash-talk each other. It is not happening.

SMITH: They are so adorable with each other.

JOFFE-WALT: She is, like, the typical very, very sweet grandmother. But Max said there is some generational tension when he goes to interview for these jobs.

MAX: One place, I applied for a job right there. It was actually a paper application. And within probably 20 feet of me, there were probably, like, five or six employees who were senior citizens. And they were just all kind of sitting around not doing anything.

SMITH: Now, we're going to ask you to be a little honest here because that's one of the job qualifications to be a human manifestation of an economic trend. What were you thinking then?

MAX: I mean, I'm not going to judge them and say that they shouldn't have those jobs or stuff like that. But...

SMITH: But you did kind of want to say that you can do it better.

MAX: Yeah. Without a doubt, I definitely could do it better.

JOFFE-WALT: So, Alice, what do you think of that idea? Like, are you keeping Max out of the job market, people like you keeping Max out of the job market?

TERRY: Well, people older than Max, yes, I guess I am. As long as I'm teaching, my job's taken. So what do we do? Kick older people off to the curb or what, you know? I mean, there's an issue here. You know, it's - I feel still competitive. And if I feel I'm not competing, if I'm still starting to go on the decline, then I would hope that I'd be wise enough to step back and give my seat to someone else.

SMITH: OK. You want competitive? We'll give you competitive. Let's do this thing. There's only one PLANET MONEY job available. Who's it going to be?

TERRY: My people skills are pretty good. What else? I've got wisdom to bring to the table, one would hope.

SMITH: So, Max, you're facing some tough competition here. What do you bring to the table that perhaps your grandmother doesn't?

MAX: You can give me a bad job, and I'll still probably have to keep it because I can't find any other jobs.

SMITH: So desperation.

JOFFE-WALT: (Laughter).

MAX: Yep. That's definitely one. I mean, I know how to use a computer, I guess.

TERRY: Can I interrupt? Max, well, you bring a future with you. If you have a job that you really like, you can commit to it for - you know, endlessly. You have - I think that that's something that's really important.

JOFFE-WALT: Max should bring Alex to his job interviews. I think it would help him.

SMITH: She's great.

JOFFE-WALT: So economists don't care about age. They don't care that Max is 18 or that Alice is 62. They basically just say what matters is how productive a worker is. But that doesn't mean that the stakes are the same for a 62-year-old and an 18-year-old. And that future thing that Alice brings up at the end - economists, when they think about Max's future, they're not that sunny.

SMITH: Again with the economists. You at PLANET MONEY - you got to have more economists. OK, OK. Fine. We need another economist.

TILL VON WACHTER: Hi, my name is Till von Wachter. I'm an associate professor at Columbia University.

JOFFE-WALT: So we have in this story an English accent. Now we get to have a German accent, too.

VON WACHTER: Oh, I could make an Italian accent, actually. Half my family is Italian. That's more interesting than the German accent.

SMITH: When Professor von Wachter lived in Germany, he had always heard about how resilient the U.S. economy was. The assumption was that, OK, sure, during a recession, young people lose jobs. But when the economy returns, those jobs come back. And everybody's happy and goes back to normal.

VON WACHTER: And that's actually a wrong assumption, it turns out.

JOFFE-WALT: Von Wachter did this research where he followed college graduates in Canada after major recessions. And he found that once they had jobs, they made less money than people who graduated before the recession hit. So that's not surprising. But here's the scary thing he found. They kept making less money.

VON WACHTER: And so even if the economy would bounce back in the next year, the persistence would still be sort of, you know, 10 to 15 years.

JOFFE-WALT: Ten to - that hurts you for 10 to 15 years?

VON WACHTER: Right. It can take quite a long time, yes.

JOFFE-WALT: So this was really surprising to me - 10 to 15 years. That means it takes at least a decade for your earnings to catch up to where they would have been otherwise if you didn't happen to graduate during a recession.

SMITH: Yeah. This totally shocked me. I mean, I always assumed that this was all about jobs. You know, a young person wants a job. They can't get that job during the recession. And so they just wait. And eventually, the recession ends. And they get their job. You know, end of story. But von Wachter's saying, that's not the way it works. When someone graduates during a recession, they make compromises. You know, they don't go for their dream job. Maybe they settle for a smaller firm that pays a little less. Or they move to a smaller city, or they start a different career that pays a lot less. So when the jobs come back, they're literally on a different career ladder - one with a lot more rungs.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. And the professor has a very technical term for people like Max in his paper - unlucky. The children of a recession are simply unlucky.

VON WACHTER: A lot of economics thinks of individuals being in charge of most of their lives and being able to steer their, say - at least their economic outcomes. What we find is that be luck. Good luck and bad luck can lead to very long-lasting effects.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah. I have to say I hate the idea of this research. I hate the idea that it just has to do with what year you graduate, how much you earn over the course of your life.

VON WACHTER: Well, nobody likes that, especially - Americans are - really like the idea that they're in charge of their life and careers. And actually, most people, I think, believe that the American labor market is extremely forgiving, that, you know, a job loss or an unlucky initial start will fade as long as you work hard enough. That turns out not to be true on average. Some recover eventually, but some also never recover.

SMITH: You know who he says never recovers? Liberal arts majors, brace yourselves.

VON WACHTER: For the English major from a lower (inaudible) school, it's never going to happen.

SMITH: Wait, ever?

VON WACHTER: Ever - so that's actually a striking finding of our study that there are some groups that never will recover.

JOFFE-WALT: Robert, were you an English major?

SMITH: No, I was not an English major. I was a psychology major - much more profitable. But, you know, I did graduate during a recession. And I understand why you hate this idea now, because you were one of the lucky ones. You graduated during the mid-2000s. It was a boom time. And I'm not saying you didn't have great radio skills, but it was easier for you. Now, I graduated in 1989. I was coming into the '90-'91 recession. And when I look at my paycheck now, I know. I was just unlucky. It wasn't my fault. I just graduated in the wrong year.

JOFFE-WALT: Well, I don't know about that theory, at least the part about me and my prodigious radio skills.

SMITH: Aw.

JOFFE-WALT: But this isn't about us. This is about Alice and Max. And I think - I guess now it is the time that we need to decide who's lucky and who's not.

SMITH: Alice, if it ever came to the point where you were directly competing with your grandson for a job, would you step aside?

TERRY: Yeah, of course I would. Yeah, no contest.

JOFFE-WALT: Max, would you step aside?

MAX: I think it really depends on the job. But, yeah, I probably would, like, if she really needed it 'cause, I mean, I have plenty of opportunities and stuff like that ahead.

SMITH: Well, the good news is that you both got the job...

JOFFE-WALT: Yay.

TERRY: Oh, yeah.

SMITH: ...As the PLANET MONEY indicator.

MAX: Awesome.

SMITH: The bad news is that it only lasts a few more seconds, the job.

(LAUGHTER)

SMITH: So we need you to end this story for us.

TERRY: This might be tough. Closure's hard for us.

MAX: All right.

TERRY: One, two, three.

MAX: For NPR News, I'm Max Spencer.

TERRY: I'm Alice Terry, NPR News, Hillsborough, N.C.

SMITH: Fantastic. Now we're going to have to let you go.

MAX: All right.

TERRY: Thank you so much.

SMITH: Like, literally, you don't have this job anymore.

TERRY: (Laughter).

SMITH: I guess it's just you and me, Chana.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. On the blog, our robot economy - we don't have jobs for teenagers, but it turns out we do have jobs for robots. And you can see them in action on our blog, npr.org/money.

SMITH: And all you English majors can send your exquisitely written, semicolon-laced complaint letters to planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Robert Smith.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LITTLE LION MAN")

MUMFORD AND SONS: (Singing) Tremble for yourself, my man. You know that you have seen this all before. Tremble, little lion man. You'll never settle any of your scores. Your grace is wasted in your face. Your boldness stands alone among the wreck. Now learn from your mother or else spend your days biting your own neck. But it was not your fault but mine.

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt. Today is Tuesday, July 20th. And that was Alice and Max welcoming
you to the podcast. Alice is in her 60s. Max is 18 years old. And on today's show,
the two are going to face off in a competition that will determine nothing less than the

OK, but first we need to do our Planet Money indicator. We have Jacob Goldstein

Okay, well, thanks for the hiccups, Jacob.
Thanks, guys.
Okay, so today on the show, we are doing a fake job interview to
illustrate a very real economic point. And it's a fact that sort of
struck all of us in the office recently. The fact is this, there
are now more people past retirement age in the workforce than

may be living with the consequences of this recession
for a very long time.
We don't want to psych them out before the interview even
starts. So here they are. They're talking to us from
Hillsborough, North Carolina.
My name is Max Marion Spencer. I'm 18. And right now for a
living, I'm trying to find a job.
And I'm Alice Terry. I'm 62. And I'm working as an educator
at a local high school.
And you two actually know each other?
Yes.
I'm Alice's grandson.
Yeah, I was there when Max was born.
It makes for a little bit of an awkward job interview.
Well, let me tell you a little bit about the job we
have here. The official title is Human Manifestation of an
Economic Trend. So we're going to choose someone to be
our generational spokesperson. Are you ready to do this
job?
It sounds like an interesting experience, other than working
at a fast food restaurant or a grocery store.
Are those all things you've applied for, Max?
Yes, actually. I've applied to Quiznos, Wendy's, McDonald's,
Arby's, Harris Teeter, Food Lion, Dollar General.
All turned you down?
Yeah, I would assume so at this point.
Oh, so Max is doing a pretty good job at this point
convincing us he is the perfect generational symbol. You
know, all those jobs, all jobs that you think of when
you think of teenagers applying for jobs, he thought
would be easy to get, but he found out that many of
them are already taken.
But I should say that Alice, his grandmother, is also
a near perfect demographical representative herself.
She's a baby boomer. She's nearing retirement, but she's
in no hurry to get out of the workforce.
I don't think I'm going to ever leave the job
world. I honestly don't think so. I don't really have
an investment portfolio to fall back on. I am really
grateful that I'm able to work and I enjoy my job.
Robert, let's just pause the interview for just a
couple of minutes because I have sort of more of an
economist's kind of question, which is just are
these two stories really connected? Is there a
direct correlation? You know, does grandma and
grandpa sticking around in the job market mean that
there really are fewer jobs for their
grandchildren?
You're right. We're going to need an economist.
Here I am.
Well, you know, a strong English accent is
preferred for this job.
Right. Well, that's good because I've got one of
those. This is Ian Sheppardson with High
Frequency Economics. He says that having more
retirees than teenagers working, it's a striking
fact, he admits it, but there are a lot of
different trends hidden in this factoid.
It's partly a demographic story just because
there are a lot of more older people around,
but it's also partly an economic story as
well, because I suspect that quite a lot of
these older workers would like to be retired

accounts stagnating at best over the last

longer.
And you can't say that that reaction is

OK, so each generation has their own
reasons for getting in and out of the job
market.
Yeah, it's not like Max and Alice are
competing for the exact same job. I mean,
she's a teacher and he's looking for
anything you can find, mostly retail work.
Although I did talk to a few grand
parent, grandchild pairs where it did
seem like there was a pretty direct
connection. I took to this one 71 year
old Ohio former police officer who he
retired and left the force, but then
realized he needed money. So he went back
to work. He found a job as a night guard.
And when we were talking, he told me,
you know, his job is a job that his
grandson would probably be qualified
for. And his grandson, like Max,
can't find work right now.
See, normally it would be so ridiculous
to have this conversation because
normally there's enough job growth to
give plenty of opportunities for both
the young and the old. There's lots
of entry level jobs. There's plenty of
jobs for people to stick around. There
are new night guardsmen jobs, but, you
know, there's also new teachers.
But this is not a normal time.
The fact is that the number of jobs
in the U.S. economy right now is not
increasing. So for every older person
who would have retired but hasn't,
there's an opening there that is
not currently available. There really
is a sort of a literal truth to
the idea that an older person in a
job is keeping a younger person out
of a job because we're not seeing
that normal expansion in the overall
number of jobs available.
This is what's referred to
technically as the cage match
situation. Two generations go in, but
only one generation comes out.
Well, good luck trying to get this
grandmother and grandson to trash
talk each other. It is not happening.
They are so adorable with each
other.
She is like the typical, very,
very sweet grandmother. But Max said
there is some generational tension
when he goes to interview for these
jobs.
One place. I applied for a job
right there. It was actually a paper
application. And within probably
20 feet of me, there were probably
like five or six employees who were
senior citizens. And they were just
all kind of sitting around not
doing anything.
Now we're going to ask you to be a
little honest here because that's one
of the job qualifications to be a
human manifestation of an economic
trend. What were you thinking then?
I mean, I'm not going to judge them
and say that they shouldn't have
those jobs or stuff like that. But
um,
but you did kind of want to say
that you can do it better.
Yeah, without a doubt, I definitely
could do it better.
So Alice, what do you think of that
idea? Like, are you keeping Max out
of the job market? People like you
keeping Max out of the job market?
Well, people older than Max, yes, I
guess I am. As long as I'm
teaching, my job's taken. So what
do we do? Kick older people off
to the curb or what? You know,
I mean, there's an issue here. You
know, it's, it's um, I feel still
competitive. And if I feel I'm not
competing, if I'm starting to go
on the decline, then I would hope
that I'd be wise enough to step
back and give my seat to someone
else.
Okay, you want competitive? We'll
give you competitive. Let's do this
thing. There's only one planet
money job available. Who's it
going to be?
My people skills are pretty good.
What else? I've got wisdom to
bring to the table. One would
hope.
So Max, you're facing some tough
competition here. What do you
bring to the table that perhaps
your grandmother doesn't?
You can give me a bad job and
I'll still probably have to keep
it because I can't find any other
jobs.
So desperation?
Yeah, that's, that's definitely
one. I mean, I know how to use
a computer, I guess.
Can you interrupt? Max, will you
bring, you bring a future with
you. If you have a job that
you really like, you can
commit to it for, you know,
endlessly. Yeah. I think that
that's something that's really
important.
Max should bring Alice to his
job interviews. I think it
would help him.
She's great.
So economists don't care about
age. They don't care that Max is
18 or that Alice is 62. They
basically just say, what
matters is how productive a
worker is. But that doesn't
mean that the stakes are the
same for a 62 year old than
an 18 year old. And that
future thing that Alice brings
up at the end. Economists,
when they think about Max's
future, they're not that
sunny.
Again, with the economist,
you have plenty of money. You
got to have more economists.
Okay, okay, fine. We need
another economist.
Hi, my name is Till from
Wachter. I'm an associate
professor at Columbia
University.
So we have in this story an
English accent. Now we get to
have a German accent too.
Oh, I could make an Italian
accent. Actually half of my
family's Italian. That's more
interesting than the German
accent.
When Professor von Wachter
lived in Germany, he had
always heard about how
resilient the U.S. economy
was. The assumption was that,
okay, sure, during a
recession, young people lose
jobs. But when the economy
returns, those jobs come
back and everybody's happy and
goes back to normal.
And that's actually a wrong
assumption.
Von Wachter did this research
where he followed college
graduates in Canada after major
recessions. And he found that
once they had jobs, they made
less money than people who
graduated before the
recession hit. So that's not
surprising. But here's the
scary thing he found. They
kept making less money.
And so even if the economy
would bounce back in the
next year, the persistence
would still be sort of,
you know, 10 to 15 years.
10 to 15. That hurts you
for 10 to 15 years?
Right. It can take quite a
long time. Yes.
So this was really
surprising to me. 10 to 15
years. That means it takes at
least a decade for your
earnings to catch up to where
they would have been
otherwise if you didn't
happen to graduate during a
recession.
Yeah, this totally shocked
me. I mean, I always assume
that this was all about
jobs. You know, a young
person wants a job. They
can't get that job during
the recession. And so they
just wait. And eventually the
recession ends and they get
their job. You know, end of
story. But Von Wachter
is saying that's not the way
it works. When someone
graduates during a recession,
they make compromises. You
know, they don't go for
their dream job. Maybe they
settle for a smaller firm
that pays a little less or
they move to a smaller
city or, or they start a
different career that pays
a lot less. So when the
jobs come back, they're
literally on a different
career ladder. One with a
lot more rungs.
And the professor has a
very technical term for
people like Max in his
paper. Unlucky. The
children of a recession are
simply unlucky.
A lot of economics thinks
of individuals, individuals
being in charge of most of
their lives and being able
to steer their say at
least their economic
outcomes. What we find is
that be luck, good luck
and bad luck can lead to
very long lasting effects.
Yeah, I have to say I
hate the idea of this
research. I hate the idea
that it just has to do
with what year you
graduate, how much you
earn over the course of
your life.
But nobody likes that,
especially Americans are
really like the idea that
they're they're in charge
of their life and careers.
And actually most people
I think believe that the
American labor market is
extremely forgiving, that
you know, job loss or an
unlucky initial start
will fade as long as you
work hard enough. That
turns out not to be true
on average. Some recover
eventually, but some
also never recover.
You know who says never
recovers? Liberal arts
majors, brace yourselves.
For the English major,
from a lower elastic
school, it's never going to
happen.
Wait, ever, ever?
Ever. So that's actually a
striking finding over a
study that there are some
groups that never will
recover.
Robert, were you an
English major?
No, I was not an English
major. I was a psychology
major, much more profitable.
But you know, I did
graduate during recession.
And and I understand why
you hate this idea now,
because you were one of
the lucky ones. You
graduated during the mid
2000s. It was a boom time.
And I'm not saying you
didn't have great radio
skills, but it was easier
for you. Now, I graduated
in 1989. I was coming
into the 1991 recession.
And and when I look at
my paycheck now, I know
I was just unlucky.
It wasn't my fault.
I just graduated in the
wrong year.
Well, I don't know
about that theory, at
least the part about me
and my prodigious radio
skill. But this isn't
about us. This is about
Alice and Max. And I
think I guess now it is
the time that we need to
decide who's lucky and
who's not.
Alice, if it ever came
to the point where you
were directly competing
with your grandson for
a job, would you step
aside?
Yeah, of course I would.
Yeah, no contest.
Max, would you step
aside?
Um, I think it really
depends on the job.
But yeah, I probably
would like if she
really needed it because
I mean, I have plenty
of opportunities and
stuff like that ahead.
Well, the good news
is that you both got
the job as the planet
money indicator. The
bad news is that it
only lasts a few more
seconds, the job. So we
need you to end this
story for us.
This might be tough.
Closure is hard for us.
All right, one, two,
three.

Fantastic. Now we're

Thank you so much.
Like literally, you
