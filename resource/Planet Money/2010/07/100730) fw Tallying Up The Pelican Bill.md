What's the price of a pelican? The total for a turtle? The dollars for a dolphin? Its not a philosophical question anymore. The BP oil spill killed hundreds of these animals, and the Feds want to make darn sure that BP pays the total bill. But coming up with a precise economic value for wildlife has stymied economists and scientists for decades. There's no market for most of these animals. No catalog for endangered species. No eBay or Craigslist for migratory birds. That's not going to stop us from trying, though. Today on the podcast, we come up with 5 different ways to put a pricetag on a pelican.

What’s the price of a pelican? The total for a turtle? The dollars for a dolphin?  Its not a philosophical question anymore. The BP oil spill killed hundreds of these animals, and the Feds want to make darn sure that BP pays the total bill.  But coming up with a precise economic value for wildlife has stymied economists and scientists for decades. There’s no market for most of these animals. No catalog for endangered species. No eBay or Craigslist for migratory birds.

That’s not going to stop us from trying, though.  Today on the podcast, we come up with 5 different ways to put a pricetag on a pelican.

PELICANS ARE PRICELESS:

This is the first thing you’ll hear from most people when you ask them to think about a value for the birds. At the Bronx Zoo, we met Ted Breg who loves to photograph pelicans, and he refused to even start an economic discussion of the devastation in the gulf. “It can’t be done, “ Berg says. “All the money in the world won’t bring them back.” It’s a fine philosophical answer, but its not a very useful one. You can’t present a bill to BP for all the money in the world.

THE BIRD LOVERS:

Just because you can’t buy a pelican, doesn’t mean we couldn’t find people spending money on them.  Hundreds of professionals and volunteers have traveled to the Gulf to rescue birds from the oil and clean them off. Millions of dollars are being spent. Isn’t that an economic indicator of value? Jay Holcomb, of the International Bird Rescue Research Center, says maybe. He says it's a sign that people feel a sense of responsibility for the future of the species. Holcomb says the average cost of rehabilitating a pelican before the BP spill was relatively modest: 500 dollars. Does this mean that the minimum price tag for a pelican is 500 bucks?  Perhaps, but Planet Money’s Adam Davidson doesn’t buy it. He says no one values birds more than environmental non-profits, so they're probably not the best indicator.

THE HOLLYWOOD EQUATION:

Remember the film Flipper?  Don’t worry.  No one else does either.  The one thing that film did have was a great comedic sidekick for the dolphin: Pete the Pelican.  It turns out that Hollywood provides something that looks a lot like a market for captive pelicans. We found a rate sheet for a pelican rental company.  A non-flying bird will set you back $1,500 a day. A flying bird could bring up to $4,500 a day. A pelican with a good agent could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. But it seems like a stretch to use Pete the Pelican as stand-in for a wild bird. Think of it this way: does the fact that Tom Cruise can make 10 million dollars a movie, mean you're worth that much too?

THE THIRTY BUCK DUCK:

Don’t tell an economist that you can’t  put a value on the invaluable.  They’ll come up with an entire discipline to do it.  It’s called contingent valuation, and  the theory is that if you ask the right way, people can asses how much a public resource is worth. We talked to the man who put a price tag on a wild duck,  Gardner Brown, of the University of Washington.  He used a survey of hunters to find out how much they would pay to take home an extra bird.  Could we use the same techniques to value a pelican?   In theory, Brown says.  But he notes that it would be difficult to get people to set aside their emotions about the oil spill and isolate how much they would actually pay to save the pelicans.

MAKE IT RIGHT:

All these failed valuation techniques are familiar turf for scientists at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service.  They’ve tried them all too.  Roger Helm with the agency says that they used to go to biological supply firms to put a price on dead fish.  They did surveys after the Exxon Valdez oil spill to value the wildlife lost.  But these days, the Feds do something different.   Instead of telling a company what they have to pay for dead animals, they just tell them they are required to restore the population of the animal.  47 dead pelicans?  The company has to pay for enough habitat or conservation programs to bring back 47 pelicans.  And that could be cheap or very, very expensive.   Helm has an elegant answer to the question of what a pelican is worth:  the price of a pelican is exactly one pelican.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

And I am Robert Smith. Today is Friday, July 30, and that was Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.

DAVIDSON: And on today's show, we're going to go to Bobby Jindal country. We're going to the Gulf of Mexico to look at the oil spill from an economic perspective. Specifically, we are going to use the principles of contingent valuation to calculate the environmental damages to the species pelecanus occidentalis.

SMITH: In other words, we are going to put a price on a pelican, and then we're going to send BP the pelican bill.

DAVIDSON: Oh, boy, Robert.

SMITH: I thought I should just get that out of the way.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. All right - no more bad puns, or maybe just one or two. All right, Let's first do the PLANET MONEY indicator. Today's PLANET MONEY indicator is 2.4%.

SMITH: Oh, sounds good.

DAVIDSON: Well, as usual, we take something that could be seen as good news and explain why it's bad news. So the government revealed today that second-quarter 2010 GDP, all the money that American citizens and government and businesses spent between April and June of this year, had grown at an annualized rate of 2.4%.

SMITH: Growth is good.

DAVIDSON: Growth is generally seen as positive when you're coming out of a recession. It means more people working, salaries going up, people consuming more. But 2.4% in normal times would be seen as close to what they call trend growth, average growth for the United States. But when you come out of a shrinking, out of a recession, the growth really needs to be much higher - 5%, 6% - to make up for that lost ground. So I'd say the vast majority of people looking at this number are quite disappointed that we have only grown by 2.4%.

SMITH: Another depressing indicator from PLANET MONEY.

DAVIDSON: Now, in a later podcast, for a deep read, we are going to be talking with Bill McKibben, the environmental writer who is going to argue that PLANET MONEY should not necessarily be sad when growth is slow or happy when growth is fast. We're going to get into that later. But first, right now, today, let's get on to the business of the pelicans.

SMITH: Yes. Now, this has been bugging me since I was down in the Gulf covering the oil spill for NPR. You know, BP has spent more than $4 billion on all of the costs associated with the spill and the cleanup so far. But mostly, it's been human costs. When you look at the bill, it's out-of-work shrimpers, paying cleanup crews, paying oil workers who are out of a job. And as I was looking at this list, I was wondering, where's the wildlife? You know, where's the line item for the turtles and the dolphins and the birds? Like, how much do we charge BP for the death of a pelican?

DAVIDSON: Now, governments actually do this all the time. They figure out what nature is worth when some large corporation has done something to damage nature so that the government can figure out how much to make the company pay for that damage.

SMITH: But as we'll see in this podcast, the process is damn hard. Just to test it out, I traveled to our nearest flock of pelicans here in New York City. That's the Bronx Zoo. And I met Ted Breg, who comes to the zoo every week to photograph birds. And he loves the pelicans.

TED BREG: They're just beautiful, and they're easily photographed. They almost pose for you.

SMITH: Yeah. No, the pelicans are - some people say they're kind of clunky-looking, but do you find...

BREG: Well, they are clunky-looking, but, you know, not everybody is tall and, you know, graceful. You know, they have their beauty.

SMITH: If you could pay a certain amount of money and have those birds come back to life, let's say, how much would be...

BREG: There's no price...

SMITH: ...Your share?

BREG: ...Because it can't be done. All the money in the world won't bring them back.

SMITH: And, Adam, this is the first answer just about everybody gives when you ask them about the value of a pelican. And this is one of the reasons why it's so hard - is this emotional hurdle. A pelican is priceless.

DAVIDSON: But here's what I find so frustrating about that view. I mean, I certainly understand the sentiment. How can you put a crass price on something as...

SMITH: You are not God.

DAVIDSON: Right - as lovely as a pelican? But here's the thing. If you're saying that a pelican is worth all the money in the world, that has the same effect as saying, pelicans are free; kill as many as you want, because saying it's all the money in the world, it's infinite - you can't really give a bill to BP saying, here, pay us all the money in the world. Pay us infinite dollars. It has the same effect of saying, here's a bill for nothing. Don't pay us anything. So sort of strangely, if you really love pelicans, possibly the best thing you can do to help them out is to put a price on them - a specific price, a dollar and cents price.

SMITH: OK. So job one is to find somebody spending money on a pelican. And I actually found somebody in Hammond, La. Jay Holcomb is with the International Bird Rescue Research Center, and he runs a facility filled with people who are giving up their valuable time and careers, have traveled to Louisiana and are cleaning oil off of birds.

JAY HOLCOMB: I think we're demonstrating that their value is in the fact that they're alive. They have a right to being here like we do, and we caused something that we have to take responsibility for.

SMITH: So Jay is in the infinite value camp. But, you know, Jay also runs a nonprofit organization. So, you know, you can convince him to talk about budgets and trade-offs. And usually he works in California. And his organization often has to make tough decisions about how many animals they can treat and still stay within their budget. And so he came up with a price, a general price on what it costs to save one pelican.

HOLCOMB: What we've done is we say, OK, so the pelicans usually come in with these problems. And we kind of average it what it costs to take care of a pelican. It's an average number. And we're saying 500 bucks is about it.

SMITH: Now, from an economic perspective, this strongly implies that whatever the value of a pelican is, it has to be more than $500 because that's how much you're willing to spend...

HOLCOMB: Yeah.

SMITH: ...Just to rehabilitate one. So...

HOLCOMB: Yeah. I didn't make that leap, but, yes, I guess you could say that.

SMITH: Well, it's just like having a used car, right? You don't want to spend more on fixing it than it's actually worth. So I assume that that applies to pelicans.

HOLCOMB: Yeah, kind of.

SMITH: So, Adam, I'm a little proud. Can we say that $500 is the minimum value for a pelican?

DAVIDSON: See; I don't like this number. I'm sorry, Robert. I know you worked hard to find a guy who actually spent money on a pelican to find out the price of a pelican. But what you did is you found one of the most fanatic pelican lovers in America, someone who's willing to devote his entire life to saving pelicans and other wildlife. And you ask that person how much a pelican is worth. So let's say you have an old Ford Fairlane that - whose Blue Book value is $3,000. You could find someone - maybe it's Jay Leno; I don't know - some really rich collector who's obsessed with Ford Fairlanes who'd be willing to pay $10 million for your Ford Fairlane. But prices are determined in a marketplace with buyers and sellers. There's a tension that is required. You can't just go to the most fanatic guy and say...

SMITH: OK.

DAVIDSON: ...How much would you pay?

SMITH: OK, I get it. OK. I needed to look for a market. Now, the problem is I literally could not find one. EBay, Craigslist, biological supply houses - you cannot buy a pelican. And it turns out there's a reason for this. You will go to jail if you start a pelican market. Let me read this. This from federal law. (Reading) It is illegal to offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, cause to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cause to be transported, carry or caused to be carried by any means any migratory bird.

DAVIDSON: Wow. OK, so the main tool that we have in our system to find a price on something, a market, is nonexistent. But, Robert, you told me that you actually did find - even with this very harsh no-selling-of-pelicans law, you did find a pelican marketplace.

SMITH: I did - Hollywood. I'm going to present you with a rate sheet for the rental of a trained movie pelican.

DAVIDSON: This is ridiculous - $4,500 a day for a pelican.

SMITH: Yup.

DAVIDSON: That is a lot more than I make.

SMITH: And $1,500 a day if you just want a sitting pelican - you know, kind of like you sitting around.

DAVIDSON: All right. So those numbers are completely insane.

SMITH: Yes. But you have not seen the movie "Flipper." Listen to this.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "FLIPPER")

JESSICA WESSON: (As Kim Parker) What's the matter, Pete?

(SOUNDBITE OF PELICAN SQUAWKING)

WESSON: (As Kim Parker) Sandy.

SMITH: That is the sound of Pete the pelican in the movie "Flipper." I know it seems like a lot, but, you know, we talked to an animal trainer, Mark Jackson. And he says you aren't just paying for the bird. You're paying for an icon.

MARK JACKSON: The way they fly, the way they fish. I mean, they're just - evolutionarily speaking, they're incredible animals. And usually, you only see things like that in a pristine environment. To me, it says - when you see pelicans flying free, things are good.

SMITH: It's symbolic of nature. It's symbolic of...

JACKSON: A healthy nature.

SMITH: Yeah, yeah. And that's worth paying for for a movie producer.

JACKSON: Absolutely. Anything they want is worth paying for.

SMITH: So here's my plan B. You shut down the first one. My idea now is that I take the day rate of a pelican. I multiply it by the number of days it works. And there you go - total value of a pelican.

JACKSON: Theoretically, it could make you, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars. It could. I mean, that - chances are it's not going to. But if you got on a big, long feature, you know, every two or three years and that bird lived 15 years, potential earnings is, you know, a lot of money.

SMITH: The hundred-thousand-dollar pelican.

DAVIDSON: Actually, Robert, you are totally wrong for several different reasons. So first of all, the reason I don't like this particular method of valuation is when economists or finance people look at a future stream of income and decide what is that worth today, what today is the likelihood of making $4,500 a day for years to come, you'd do something called a net present value evaluation, which is always a much smaller number than the big number, like when someone wins $100 million in the lottery but they get $6 million today. That's the kind of calculation. So the hundred thousand is way too high. But second of all, the movie producers are paying for a service. They're paying for the trainer and all the time that they train this particular pelican.

SMITH: Yeah - food, the lodging...

DAVIDSON: The food, the lodging.

SMITH: ...The safety. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: They're not just paying for any random pelican. So if we want to find out what is the value of a random pelican in the Gulf of Mexico, it's going to be a lot less than the well-trained pelican with a trainer on the Hollywood set.

SMITH: See; this whole time, I've been thinking that what I am personally worth is based on the rate sheet for Tom Cruise.

DAVIDSON: My point exactly.

SMITH: OK, listen. I do have something that I think will finally convince you because it comes with your favorite thing in the world - an economist. Now we're going to get to what we talked about the top of the show - the contingent valuation. So this is a theory that some resources may not have a price tag, but they're valuable to so many people that you can figure out what they're worth by basically talking to people. So under this theory, a wild pelican could actually be worth more than the Tom Cruise Hollywood version of the pelican because a wild pelican has 300 million - to pull a number - owners. If you say they can belong to anyone, they belong to all Americans. So even if a pelican is only worth a few cents to me and maybe one cent to you, you multiply that by 300 million people, and you have a pricy bird.

DAVIDSON: Right. And you actually got all excited, brought me into the studio so that we can both talk to this economist who was one of the early pioneers of this way of thinking. His name's Gardner Brown. He's a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Washington.

SMITH: And Professor Brown is famous - I mean, he's kind of famous in this field - for coming up with the value of a wild duck. And I love this. His price tag for a duck - $30, the 30-buck duck. He did in a way that's a little controversial in economics. He used a survey. He asked questions of the people who are closest to wild ducks, which happens to be hunters.

GARDNER BROWN: I asked them how much they would be willing to pay for one more duck.

SMITH: So if you could walk home with 12 ducks instead of 11 ducks, how much would you slip some guy money under the table?

BROWN: Or be willing to pay to change the harvest regulations?

SMITH: But, Professor Brown, how can you trust people to know these things? I mean, you ask them about a duck. Maybe they've never thought about it in their life. And they just pick a number out of the air, and that becomes the value of the duck.

BROWN: Well, that's a standard attack on this. But what you - when you design these surveys, you - if you do them well and you can afford it, you set up questions to make sure to test to see whether people are behaving in a rational way.

DAVIDSON: Now, why not actually try and set up markets? Why not go to where hunters are and set up a stand that says...

SMITH: What - with - wait. Wait - with a duck and, like, here's a gun and...

DAVIDSON: No, well, you can have a permit.

SMITH: How much are you going to pay to shoot this duck? You can't do that.

DAVIDSON: You could say like, oh, we're selling permits for one more duck.

BROWN: You guys have been reading the literature. You're clever.

SMITH: Oh, I'm sorry, Adam. I meant to edit out that last part - you know, the part where he says...

BROWN: You're clever.

DAVIDSON: All right. But aside from the fact that he was flattering us, which I did like, I have an instinctive distrust of this survey method. Now...

SMITH: Big surprise.

DAVIDSON: Let's leave aside the fact, that in the duck survey, he was surveying hunters to kill ducks, and we're talking about the price of keeping a pelican alive. That's a separate issue.

SMITH: You can handle that with the math.

DAVIDSON: Right. But the prices and value in economic terms is determined in a marketplace. There is a tension between buyer and seller. And there's a real-world cost. If I want to pay 30 bucks to shoot that duck, which I would never want to do, I don't have that 30 bucks to buy a really nice lunch or a bottle of wine or whatever it might be. And I have to actually pay a cost. But in a survey, if someone just comes up and says, how much would you pay for such and such, there's no dynamic. There's no price I'm paying. I just don't trust that number. I feel like surveys are not a great way to find out the value of things.

SMITH: Yeah, I probably should have talked to you before I went and did a survey. You remember at the beginning of the podcast, I went to the Bronx Zoo? Well, I had a mission. I was going to go and get the definitive value of a pelican. I was going to take the Professor Brown method. I was going to talk to people, ask them the right question and become famous in the world of contingent valuation for being the man who figured out how much a pelican was worth. And you make an excellent point because when I actually talked to people, you could see them struggling with how to place this in their real-world understanding of how much they would pay for things. The numbers I got were all over the place.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Two hundred dead pelicans back to life - how much would we contribute on that? I would contribute our vinyl siding account, which is maybe around $10,000 (laughter).

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A thousand dollars I would pay.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I would pay a dollar, for sure. Yeah, that's not a lot.

SMITH: A dollar, $10,000. Really? He's going to pay $10,000. This is what is referred to as volatility in the pelican market.

DAVIDSON: I actually think it's referred to as just a very badly designed survey...

SMITH: I didn't have much...

DAVIDSON: 'Cause I will say that Gardner Brown's surveys probably had less variation than that. But from what we have learned this week, a lot of government agencies have realized that this survey method does bring in lots and lots of seemingly arbitrary numbers. And so they're actually moving away from the survey approach.

SMITH: Yeah. I was getting desperate, mostly because you were shooting out all my ideas. And I didn't know how I was going to come up with the final price tag. I wanted to give a final price for a pelican, and then I discovered something. Like, I am not alone. This isn't just my own personal mission. In fact, there is somebody else trying to value a pelican - NRDA.

DAVIDSON: So there's another nerd trying to value pelicans.

SMITH: Yeah, yeah, very funny - NRDA, N-R-D-A, the National Resource Damage Assessment. It's the process that the federal government uses to put a cost on wildlife. I mean, there are guys - NRDA guys - who are out in boats everywhere, figuring out what's been killed and figuring out how much that's going to be worth. So I called up one of these NRDA guys. And I was totally excited. I described what we'd been doing. And he told me I've been going about this completely wrong.

ROGER HELM: Yeah, I mean, certainly not how we try to value natural resources today in our process.

SMITH: Roger Helm is the chief of environmental quality for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. And he was actually very nice when he was smacking me down. He said that the U.S. government used to do what I was doing. Back in the old Superfund days, they would do exactly what I did. They would figure out all these little tricks to find out the price of an animal.

HELM: People would actually try to look up values of organisms in biological supply catalogs and say, well, you killed, you know, 42 fish, and they're - let me see. Let me check - page 17. Ah, they're 27 cents each or something of that nature. It wasn't really so good with birds 'cause they didn't have the number of birds and the species.

SMITH: Was there ever sort of a philosophical reluctance to see that in black and white, what an animal is worth in dollars and cents?

HELM: Oh, absolutely. When we were doing this, when I first started this back after the Exxon Valdez spill and people were telling me this is how the process had worked, you know - it sort of gives you the - makes you just feel very uncomfortable in valuing these organisms this way. And, of course, it just really fell apart anyway as you got into any depth to it.

DAVIDSON: So now we learned the U.S. government is going about valuing wildlife, like in the BP spill, in a completely opposite direction. Instead of looking at what the company did and putting a dollar value on each animal killed, they're just saying to the company, hey; you got rid of a bunch of wildlife. You got to bring back a bunch of wildlife.

SMITH: You have to physically replace the habitat or create a situation where there are more baby pelicans born or somehow prevent other pelicans from dying. You have to basically bring the numbers of pelicans back up to the original level.

HELM: If they kill 47 pelicans, they owe the public 47 pelicans.

SMITH: So they have to pay you to do whatever it takes to get those, say, 47 pelicans back.

HELM: They are responsible to make the public whole.

SMITH: So when I ask you, how much is a pelican worth that died in the BP oil spill?

HELM: My answer is that is worth one pelican.

SMITH: One pelican. And the price for a turtle is a new turtle, and a dolphin's equivalent to a dolphin. Now, I got to say, Adam, you have doubted this whole thing. But you have to admit, there is a certain elegance here because there is a price. The company, BP in this case, will have to pay a price but not for the animal itself - for basically making right what went wrong.

DAVIDSON: I got to say, Robert, I find that my economic training leads me to love and hate this solution. And let me explain.

SMITH: (Laughter) Well, at least there's a little love this time.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, there is some love. So the love part is you are pushing BP and the system to move towards actual markets. So if they say, OK, we killed 47 pelicans or 200 pelicans, but we can shore up this barrier island and create a nesting habitat for pelicans, and that means there will be more than 200 new pelicans that wouldn't have existed otherwise, and they can actually price the cost of the equipment and the time and the services to improve that barrier island - you know, you're talking about real prices. And it makes sense. It - they might look at five different options and choose the most efficient, effective option. And that all makes a lot of sense to me.

The part of the solution I feel really uncomfortable with is it's back to sort of infinitely valuing pelicans because what if BP looks at all the ways you could save pelicans and finds there are no cheap ways? It's really, really expensive, and it's going to cost millions and millions of dollars per pelican. Now, I don't think you're going to find too many people who care that much if BP has to pay a lot of money. But I think most people in our society would agree that spending hundreds of millions of dollars to save a couple hundred pelicans is probably not the best use of that money. So, again, I feel like we're back to having sort of an arbitrary price to pelicans.

SMITH: No, absolutely. I mean, there is no question that this can get very, very expensive. But you have to go through this process. There are dead pelicans. There is a responsible party. And you have to go through the process to put even an arbitrary price. Trying to get a fair price is better than having no price at all. And where there's no market, it's going to be hard. It's going to be difficult. You're going have to go through all of these objections you've said. But at the end of the day, you've got to put a number down, and you've got to go with the best shot you have. And so far, I think a pelican is worth a pelican is about the best shot they got.

DAVIDSON: And what I do agree with is if you don't do this, if you don't come up with an arbitrary price, then a pelican is free. And then, it's free to kill pelicans, and we'll end up with a lot more dead pelicans.

SMITH: There you go.

It means more people working, salaries going up, people consuming more.
But 2.4% in normal times would be seen as close to what they call trend growth,
average growth for the United States.
But when you come out of a shrinking, out of a recession, the growth really needs to
be much higher, 5%, 6% to make up for that lost ground.
So I'd say the vast majority of people looking at this number are quite disappointed
that we have only grown by 2.4%.
Another depressing indicator from Planet Money.
Now, on a later podcast or a deep read, we are going to be talking with Bill McKibben,
the environmental writer, who is going to argue that Planet Money should not necessarily
be sad when growth is slow or happy when growth is fast.
We're going to get into that later.
But first, right now, today, let's get on to the business of the Pelican.
Yes.
Now, this has been bugging me since I was down in the Gulf covering the oil spill
for NPR.
You know, BP has spent more than $4 billion on all of the costs associated with the
spill and the cleanup so far.
But mostly it's been human costs.
When you look at the bill, it's out of work shrimpers, paying cleanup crews,
playing oil workers who are out of a job.
And as I was looking at this list, I was wondering, where's the wildlife?
You know, where's the line at him for the turtles and the dolphins and the birds?
Like, how much do we charge BP for the death of a Pelican?
Now, governments actually do this all the time.
They figure out what nature is worth when some large corporation has done something
to damage nature so that the government can figure out how much to make the company
pay for that damage.
But as we'll see on this podcast, the process is damn hard.
Just to test it out, I traveled to our nearest flock of Pelicans here in New York City.
That's the Bronx Zoo.
And I met Ted Breg, who comes to the zoo every week to photograph birds and he loves
the Pelicans.
They're just beautiful and they're easily photographed.
They almost pose for you.
Yeah.
Now, the Pelicans are beautiful.
Some people say they're kind of clunky looking.
Well, they are clunky looking, but they're, you know, not everybody is tall and,
you know, graceful.
You know, they have their beauty.
If you could pay a certain amount of money and have those birds come back to life, let's
say, how much would be your share?
Because it can't be done.
All the money in the world won't bring them back.
And Adam, this is the first answer just about everybody gives when you ask them
about the value of a Pelican.
And this is one of the reasons why it's so hard is this emotional hurdle.
A Pelican is priceless.
But here's what I find so frustrating about that view.
I mean, I certainly understand the sentiment.
How can you put a crass price on something as you are not God?
Right.
As lovely as a Pelican.
But here's the thing.
If you're saying that a Pelican is worth all the money in the world, that has the
same effect as saying Pelicans are free.
Kill as many as you want.
Because saying it's all the money in the world, it's infinite.
You can't really give a bill to BP saying, here, pay us all the money in the world.
Pay us infinite dollars.
It has the same effect of saying here's a bill for nothing.
Don't pay us anything.
So sort of strangely, if you really love Pelicans, possibly the best thing you can do to help
them out is to put a price on them, a specific price, a dollar and cents price.
Okay.
So job one is to find somebody spending money on a Pelican.
And I actually found somebody.
In Hammond, Louisiana, Jay Holcomb is with the International Bird Rescue Research
Center and he runs a facility filled with people who are giving up their valuable
time and careers, have traveled to Louisiana and are cleaning oil off of birds.
I think we're demonstrating that their value is in the fact that they're alive.
They have a right to being here like we do and we cause something that we have to
take responsibility for.
So Jay is in the infinite value camp.
But you know, Jay also runs a nonprofit organization.
So you know, you can convince him to talk about budgets and tradeoffs.
And usually he works in California and his organization often has to make tough decisions
about how many animals they can treat and still stay within their budget.
And so he came up with a price, a general price on what it costs to save one Pelican.
What we've done is we say, okay, so the Pelicans usually come in with these problems
and we kind of average it, what it costs to take care of a Pelican.
It's an average number.
And we're saying 500 bucks is about it.
Now from an economic perspective, this strongly implies that whatever the value
of a Pelican is, it has to be more than $500 because that's how much you're willing to
spend just to rehabilitate one.
So I didn't make that leap, but yes, I guess you could say that.
Well, it's just like having a used car, right?
You don't want to spend more on fixing it than it's actually worth.
So I assume that that applies to Pelicans.
Yeah, it's kind of.
So Adam, I'm a little proud.
Can we say that $500 is the minimum value for Pelican?
See, I don't like this number.
I'm sorry, Robert.
You worked hard to find a guy who actually spent money on a Pelican to find out the price
of a Pelican.
But what you did is you found one of the most fanatic Pelican lovers in America, someone
who's willing to devote his entire life to saving Pelicans and other wildlife,
and you asked that person how much a Pelican is worth.
So let's say you have an old Ford Fairlane whose blue book value is $3,000.
You could find someone, maybe it's Jay Leno, I don't know, some really rich
collector who's obsessed with Ford Fairlanes who'd be willing to pay $10 million for your
Ford Fairlane.
But prices are determined in a marketplace with buyers and sellers.
There's a tension that is required.
You can't just go to the most fanatic guy and say, how much would you pay?
OK, I get it.
OK, I needed to look for a market.
Now the problem is I literally could not find one, eBay, Craigslist, biological
supply houses.
You cannot buy a Pelican.
And it turns out there's a reason for this.
You will go to jail if you start a Pelican market.
Let me read this.
This is from federal law.
It is illegal to offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for
shipment, ship, cost to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cost to
be transported, carrier, cost to be carried by any means, any migratory bird.
Wow.
OK, so the main tool that we have in our system to find a price on something,
a market is non-existent.
Robert, you told me that you actually did find, even with this very harsh no
selling of Pelican's law, you did find a Pelican marketplace.
I did.
Hollywood, I am going to present you with a rate sheet for the rental of a
trained movie Pelican.
This is ridiculous.
Forty five hundred dollars a day for a Pelican.
That is a lot more than I make.
And fifteen hundred dollars a day if you just want a sitting Pelican, you know,
kind of like you sitting around.
All right. So those numbers are completely insane.
Yes. But you have not seen the movie Flipper.
Listen to this.
What's the matter, V?
Sandy!
That is the sound of Pete the Pelican in the movie Flipper.
I know it seems like a lot, but, you know, we talked to an animal trainer,
Mark Jackson, and he says you aren't just paying for the bird.
You're paying for an icon.
The way they fly, the way they fish, I mean, they're just evolutionarily
speaking, they're incredible animal.
And usually you only see things like that in a pristine environment.
To me, it says when you see Pelican flying free, things are good.
It's symbolic of nature. It's symbolic of...
A healthy nature.
Yeah, yeah.
And that's worth paying for, for a movie producer.
Absolutely. Anything they want is worth paying for.
So here's my plan B. You shot down the first one.
My idea now is that I take the day rate of a Pelican,
I multiply it by the number of days it works.
And there you go. Total value of a Pelican.
Theoretically, it could make you, you know, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
You could. I mean, that chances are it's not going to.
But if you got on a big long feature, you know, every two or three years
and that bird lived 15 years, potential earnings is, you know,
a lot of money.
The $100,000 Pelican.
Actually, Robert, you are totally wrong for several different reasons.
So first of all, the reason I don't like this particular method
of valuation is when economists or finance people look at a future
stream of income and decide what is that worth today,
what today is the likelihood of making $4,500 a day for years to come.
You do something called a net present value valuation,
which is always a much smaller number than the big number.
Like when someone wins $100 million in the lottery,
but they get $6 million today, that's the kind of calculation.
So the $100,000 is way too high.
But second of all, the movie producers are paying for a service.
They're paying for the trainer and all the time
that they train this particular pelican, the lodging, the lodging.
They're not just paying for any random pelican.
So if we want to find out what is the value of a random pelican
in the Gulf of Mexico, it's going to be a lot less than the well
trained pelican with a trainer on the Hollywood set.
See, this whole time, I've been thinking that what I am
personally worth is based on the rate sheet for Tom Cruise.
My point exactly.
OK, listen, I do have something that I think will finally
convince you because it comes with your favorite thing in the world, an economist.
Now we're going to get to what we talked about at the top of the show,
the contingent valuation.
So this is a theory that some resources may not have a price tag,
but they're valuable to so many people that you can figure out
what they're worth by basically talking to people.
So under this theory, a wild pelican can actually be worth more
than the Tom Cruise Hollywood version of the pelican
because a wild pelican has 300 million, to pull a number, owners.
If you say they can belong to anyone, they belong to all Americans.
So even if a pelican is only worth a few cents to me and maybe one cent to you,
you multiply that by 300 million people and you have a pricey bird.
Right. And you actually got all excited, brought me into the studio
so that we could both talk to this economist who was one of the early
pioneers of this way of thinking.
His name's Gardner Brown.
He's a professor emeritus of economics at the University of Washington.
And Professor Brown is famous.
I mean, he's kind of famous in this field.
For coming up with the value of a wild duck.
And I love this. His price tag for a duck, $30.
The 30 buck duck.
He did it in a way that's a little controversial in economics.
He used a survey.
He asked questions of the people who are closest to wild ducks,
which happens to be hunters.
I asked them how much they would be willing to pay for one more duck.
So if you could walk home with 12 ducks instead of 11 ducks,
how much would you slip some guy money under the table?
Or be willing to pay to change the harvest regulations.
But Professor Brown, how can you trust people to know these things?
I mean, you ask them about a duck.
Maybe they've never thought about it in their life.
And they just pick a number out of the air.
And that becomes the value of the duck.
Well, that's a standard attack on this.
But when you design these surveys, if you do them well and you
can afford it, you set up questions to make sure to test
to see whether people are behaving in a rational way.
Now, why not actually try and set up markets?
Why not go to where hunters are and set up a stand that says?
What, with a duck and like here's a gun?
How much are you going to pay to shoot this duck?
You can't do that.
You could say like, oh, we're selling permits for one more duck.
You guys have been reading the literature.
You're clever.
Oh, I'm sorry, Adam.
I meant to edit out that last part.
You know, the part where he says, you're clever.
But aside from the fact that he was flattering us, which I did
like, I have an instinctive distrust of this survey
method.
Big surprise.
Let's leave aside the fact that in the duck survey,
he was surveying hunters to kill ducks.
And we're talking about the price
of keeping a pelican alive.
That's a separate issue.
You can handle that with the math.
Right.
But the prices and value in economic terms
is determined in a marketplace.
There is a tension between buyer and seller.
And there's a real world cost.
If I want to pay $30 to shoot that duck, which I would never
want to do, I don't have that $30 to buy a really nice lunch
or a bottle of wine or whatever it might be.
And I have to actually pay a cost.
But in a survey, if someone just comes up and says,
how much would you pay for such and such,
there's no dynamic.
There's no price I'm paying.
I just don't trust that number.
I feel like surveys are not a great way
to find out the value of things.
Yeah.
I probably should have talked to you before I did a survey.
You remember at the beginning of the podcast
I went to the Bronx Zoo.
Well, I had a mission.
I was going to go and get the definitive value
of a pelican.
I was going to take the Professor Brown method.
I was going to talk to people,
ask them the right question, and become
famous in the world of contingent valuation
for being the man who figured out
how much a pelican was worth.
And you make an excellent point, because when I actually
talk to people, you could see them struggling
with how to place this in their real world
understanding of how much they would pay for things.
The numbers I got were all over the place.
200 dead pelicans back to life.
How much would you contribute on that?
I would contribute our vinyl siding account,
which is maybe around $10,000.
$1,000 I would pay.
I would pay $1 for sure.
Yeah.
It's not a lot.
$1, $10,000?
Really, he's going to pay $10,000?
This is what is referred to as volatility
in the pelican market.
I actually think it's referred to as just a very badly
designed survey, because I will say that Gardner Brown's
surveys probably had less variation than that.
But from what we have learned this week,
a lot of government agencies have
realized that this survey method does bring in lots
and lots of seemingly arbitrary numbers.
And so they're actually moving away
from the survey approach.
Yeah, I was getting desperate, mostly because you're
shooting out all my ideas.
And I didn't know how I was going to come up
with the final price tag.
I wanted to give a final price for a pelican.
And then I discovered something.
I am not alone.
This isn't just my own personal mission.
In fact, there is somebody else
trying to value a pelican.
Nerda.
So there's another nerd trying to value pelicans?
Yeah, very funny.
Nerda, NRDA, the National Resource Damage Assessment.
It's the process that the federal government uses
to put a cost on wildlife.
I mean, there are guys, nerda guys,
who are out in boats everywhere figuring out
what's been killed and figuring out
how much that's going to be worth.
So I called up one of these nerda guys.
And I was totally excited.
I described what we've been doing.
And he told me, I've been going
about this completely wrong.
Yeah, I mean, certainly not how
we try to value natural resources today in our process.
Roger Helm is the chief of environmental quality
for the US Fish and Wildlife Service.
And he's actually very nice when he was smacking me
down.
He said that the US government used
to do what I was doing back in the old Superfund days.
They would do exactly what I did.
They would figure out all these little tricks
to find out the price of an animal.
People would actually try to look up
values of organisms in biological supply catalogs
and say, well, you killed 42 fish.
And they're, let me see, page 17.
They're $0.27 each or something of that nature.
It wasn't really so good with birds
because they didn't have the number of birds
and the species.
Was there ever a philosophical reluctance
to see that in black and white, what an animal is worth
in dollars and cents?
Oh, absolutely.
When we were doing this, when I first started this back
after the Exxon Valdez spill,
and people were telling me this
is how the process had worked,
it makes you just feel very uncomfortable
in valuing these organisms this way.
And of course it just really fell apart anyway
as you got into any depth to it.
So now we've learned the US government
is going about valuing wildlife,
like in the BP spill,
in a completely opposite direction.
Instead of looking at what the company did
and putting a dollar value on each animal killed,
they're just saying to the company,
hey, you got rid of a bunch of wildlife,
you gotta bring back a bunch of wildlife.
You have to physically replace the habitats
or create a situation
where there are more baby pelicans born
or somehow prevent other pelicans from dying.
You have to basically bring the numbers of pelicans
back up to the original level.
If they kill 47 pelicans,
they owe the public 47 pelicans.
So they have to pay you to do whatever it takes
to get those, say, 47 pelicans back.
They are responsible to make the public whole.
So when I ask you how much is a pelican worth
that died in the BP oil spill?
My answer is that is worth one pelican.
One pelican.
And the price for a turtle is a new turtle,
and a dolphin's equivalent to a dolphin.
Now I gotta say, Adam, you have doubted this whole thing,
but you have to admit there is a certain elegance here
because there is a price.
The company, BP in this case,
will have to pay a price,
but not for the animal itself,
for basically making right what went wrong.
I gotta say, Robert,
I find that my economic training
leads me to love and hate this solution.
Well, at least there's a little love this time.
Yeah, there is some love.
So the love part is you are pushing BP
and the system to move towards actual market.
So if they say, okay, we killed 47 pelicans
or 200 pelicans,
but we can shore up this barrier island
and create a nesting habitat for pelicans,
and that means there will be more than 200 new pelicans
that wouldn't have existed otherwise,
and they can actually price the cost of the equipment
and the time and the services
to improve that barrier island.
You're talking about real prices,
and it makes sense.
They might look at five different options
and choose the most efficient, effective option,
and that all makes a lot of sense to me.
The part of the solution I feel really uncomfortable with
is it's back to sort of infinitely valuing pelicans,
because what if BP looks at all the ways
you could save pelicans and finds there are no cheap ways?
It's really, really expensive,
and it's gonna cost millions and millions of dollars
per pelican.
Now, I don't think you're gonna find too many people
who care that much if BP has to pay a lot of money,
but I think most people in our society would agree
that spending hundreds of millions of dollars
to save a couple hundred pelicans
is probably not the best use of that money.
So again, I feel like we're back to having
sort of an arbitrary price to pelicans.
No, absolutely.
There's no question that this can get very, very expensive,
but you have to go through this process.
There are dead pelicans.
There is a responsible party,
and you have to go through the process
to put even an arbitrary price.
Trying to get a fair price
is better than having no price at all.
And where there's no market, it's gonna be hard,
it's gonna be difficult.
You're gonna have to go through all of these objections
you've said, but at the end of the day,
you've gotta put a number down,
and you've gotta go with the best shot you have.
And so far, I think a pelican is worth a pelican
is about the best shot they got.
And what I do agree with is if you don't do this,
if you don't come up with an arbitrary price,
then a pelican is free,
and then it's free to kill pelicans,
and we'll end up with a lot more dead pelicans.
There you go.
