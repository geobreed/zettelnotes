On today's Planet Money, we talk to people who've been inside those rooms. And we unpack the latest Basel rules -- regulations that are supposed to apply to banks around the world, and that are due later this year. (Spoiler alert: They'll probably make the system safer. But they won't end financial crises.)

The Basel Committee On Banking Supervision meets in in round, windowless rooms in a tower in Basel, Switzerland. Its decisions play a huge role in the global financial system. Its meetings are closed to the public, and don't get much attention in the popular press.

On today's Planet Money, we talk to people who've been inside those rooms. And we unpack the latest Basel rules — regulations that are supposed to apply to banks around the world, and that are due later this year.

(Spoiler alert: They'll probably make the system safer. But they won't end financial crises.)

For more, read our Basel post from Friday. And see these reports from the Basel Committee and the Institute of International Finance, an industry group.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

I know you have to go. Let me - last thing is, can we go to that meeting in July?

STEVEN CHOQUETTE: No.

GOLDSTEIN: OK.

CHOQUETTE: OK?

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks a lot for your time.

CHOQUETTE: Sure. Bye.

GOLDSTEIN: Bye.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "WRITTEN IN REVERSE")

SPOON: (Singing) I'm writing this to you in reverse. Someone better call a hearse. I can see it all from here, from just a few glimpses. Now that lightbulb's gone off, and it's pulling my wince. And now...

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

GOLDSTEIN: And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today's Tuesday, August 24. And that was me you heard at the top getting shot down by a guy named Steven Choquette, who, despite what you heard, is actually a really nice guy.

BLUMBERG: Right. And we are going to be hearing from Steven Choquette today because he figures heavily in today's podcast. We are going to be talking about a shadowy international network of financial elites who gather in secret meetings in a small town in Switzerland to decide the fate of the world's financial system. Jacob, that's as sexy as I could make the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision sound. How do you think I did?

GOLDSTEIN: I think you made it sound sexy as hell, Alex.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: And I actually don't think you oversold it. I mean, Basel is where these key rules that govern the world's banks are getting hammered out right now. What goes on in Basel is arguably as important for global finance as anything that happens in the U.S. Congress. And still, most people have never heard of it.

BLUMBERG: Until now.

GOLDSTEIN: Until just a minute from now.

BLUMBERG: OK.

GOLDSTEIN: Because I got to give you the indicator.

BLUMBERG: All right. Let's have it. What is it?

GOLDSTEIN: One year. It would take one year - or 12 1/2 months if you want to be precise - to sell all of the existing homes that were on the market in the U.S. in July.

BLUMBERG: Ooh. That's bad, huh?

GOLDSTEIN: It's bad, right? Because, you know, obviously, this indicator is a function of supply and demand. There were a lot of houses for sale in the U.S. in July, but nobody - nobody - was buying. Sales of existing homes actually hit their lowest level in more than a decade.

BLUMBERG: So in a normal scenario, the supply of existing homes in the market would take about six months to sell. Twelve months, what we have today, is double what's considered normal. That's bad. So this looks like a glut, and it suggests that house prices have to fall a lot further.

GOLDSTEIN: It does. And, you know, if this was just one kind of outlier indicator, I'd say, well, it's a fluke. It's just one month. But the pattern for housing has really been pretty consistent across a bunch of different indicators. We saw the market bottom out in the first half of last year. We saw it climb at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. But then in the past few months, indicator after indicator has shown that the housing market is turning again. It's falling again.

BLUMBERG: All right. Enough about housing. Let's move on to global banking, shall we?

GOLDSTEIN: Let's go.

BLUMBERG: All right. So the one thing that everybody agreed - or seemed to agree - about the financial crisis we just went through was that financial institutions did not have enough money set aside as a safety cushion. In finance speak, they say banks didn't have enough capital, or banks had too much leverage. It is the same thing. They didn't have enough money in reserve to protect them in a downturn. So you'd think the Dodd-Frank bill, the sweeping financial overhaul designed to make sure that we won't have to go through the financial crisis again that Congress just passed, you would think that that would set clear, deliberate rules on bank leverage, but it doesn't.

GOLDSTEIN: And in fact, the Obama administration actually pushed to leave those rules out of the bill. Timothy Geithner, in a letter to Congressman Keith Ellison, wrote, quote, "we do not believe that codifying a specific numerical leverage requirement in statute would be appropriate."

BLUMBERG: And the reason, he says, is that coming up with an actual number, actually setting what the leverage requirements would be for banks, is best left to other regulatory agencies. And he mentions one by name. He writes that he'd like to leave it to the, quote, "Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to develop an international agreement on the form, structure and level of such a leverage ratio."

GOLDSTEIN: So then the question is, what is this Basel Committee, right?

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Yeah.

GOLDSTEIN: And why is Geithner saying, let's put this committee in charge of, you know, what's arguably the most important piece of reforming the world's financial system?

BLUMBERG: So I've been trying to answer this question for a while now. And the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, broadly, you can think of it as the supergroup of world banking regulators. So four times a year, the chief financial regulators from all over the world, central banks all over the world, they meet, and they coordinate global banking regulation. And so who are these people? Like, from the U.S., you can think people from the Fed, people from the FDIC - the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates banks. That's Sheila Bair. Sheila Bair goes to Basel. So that's the basics. But finding out much more than that is very difficult, as you yourself found out, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. That clip at the top was me asking a senior guy affiliated with Basel, Steve Choquette, could we actually just go to one of these meetings just to watch? And his answer was very clear, right?

BLUMBERG: No.

GOLDSTEIN: No.

BLUMBERG: And then so I figured, well, I'll do the next best thing. I'll call the regulators from the United States who go to these meetings, and I'll ask them what it's like. So I called around - the Fed, the FDIC. Both of them said no. They won't talk to us on the record about that. So then I tried to find former regulators who had been to Basel, who could tell me what it's like. And that's when I learned you should not do a story about Basel in August because everyone was on vacation. I finally did, though, track down some people who'd been to Basel and could talk about it. And the first thing I asked was, like, what is the room like where people meet?

BARBARA MATTHEWS: They're circular rooms because it's in a tower. No windows.

BLUMBERG: This is Barbara Matthews. She's an international financial expert who runs a company called BCM. She talked to me while she was on vacation on the beach from her hotel room. And then I also talked to a guy named Doug Elliott, who's a scholar at Brookings Institution. He was just back from a vacation.

DOUG ELLIOTT: There are no windows. This way - you have to remember banking regulation is essentially boring. So you don't want windows that would distract you. Anything will distract you. So no windows, not much else to really focus on. And, you know, you're there with other policy people and regulators and bureaucrats talking about some fairly detailed technical issues.

GERRY CORRIGAN: The subject matter, as you can imagine, is quite complex, to put it mildly.

BLUMBERG: This is Gerry Corrigan. He's currently a managing director at Goldman Sachs. But for many years, he was the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, and he chaired the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. He talked to me while he was on vacation from his fishing lodge in the mountains.

CORRIGAN: In my days, there were probably 25 or 30 people at the table.

BLUMBERG: I just printed out some random pages from Basel II, the final accord. And so, you know, like, Page 25, it says for risk-weighting purposes, short-term assessments are deemed to be issue specific. They can only be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from the rated facility. They cannot be - and, you know, 250 pages of that type of language. And at these meetings, were you picking up this type of language and saying - and arguing about it?

CORRIGAN: Well, we never argued; we discussed.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: So, OK, Alex, let's just pause from all these people who are on vacation and talking to you and just step back and look at what Basel is. Basel Committee has been around meeting in these oval, windowless room since the late 1970s. And, you know, over the past several decades, banking has become more global. Today most of us, just small savers, we have our money in banks that operate internationally. So, you know, the Basel process has become more important as the financial system has become more global. Here's Doug Elliott again.

ELLIOTT: It's basically where the financial bureaucrats around the world are coming together to decide what the safety margins are that banks have to hold. So if the banks in our system had had more capital when we went through the recent financial crisis, it wouldn't have been nearly as bad, and the panic wouldn't have spread as much because we would have known that banks had a fair amount of safety margin. Instead, they went in without that much of a margin, and then everything hit the fan, and it got a lot worse. People justifiably panicked.

GOLDSTEIN: So sure, OK, capital requirements are important. We can agree about that. But there's still this question of, why regulate capital requirements in this way? Why leave this super important thing to some little-known group in windowless rooms in Switzerland?

BLUMBERG: And so the idea here is that the world should have a single set of banking rules because, otherwise, global banks would just relocate to whatever country has the most lax rules. So Steve Choquette, the guy we heard at the top shooting you down, Jacob, he's an economist, and he works closely with the Basel process.

CHOQUETTE: You have to think about regulation as an arms race.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

CHOQUETTE: You're laughing, but I'm serious. And the arms race is between the regulators and the supervisors on the one side and the banks on the other side. So every day, the banks wake up looking for a way around it, and the regulators and the supervisors look for a way to try and contain the next thing they do. And if you write the laws in too restrictive a way, then what you do is you tie one hand behind the backs of the regulators and the supervisors in that arms race that they're in.

BLUMBERG: All right. So the two sides in this arms race, they each have weapons, and the weapons are made of paper and math. Here's one. This is the most advanced weapon from the industry side. It's a report from the IIF, the Institute of International Finance, saying that if the Basel rules currently under discussion are passed, the world economy will grow much more slowly. You know, it says, basically, if you make banks hold more money in reserve, they won't lend as much money out. People won't be able to buy as much stuff on credit. Businesses won't be able to borrow to start factories, to hire people, et cetera. So, Jacob, boom - what do you say to that?

GOLDSTEIN: It's not about what I say, Alex.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: It's about what Choquette and his people say. And, you know, you may not be surprised to learn they have their own bomb. They say in their own report, you know what hurts economic growth? Great big financial crises like the one we just had.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: So in the long term, if you make banks safer, we have fewer great big financial crises. That'll be good for the economy. It'll be good for jobs. It'll be good for all the rest.

BLUMBERG: Right. Now, this all sounds very simple, making banks safer. But when you get into it, this arms race boils down to a lot of super technical details and decisions to make. So for example, if a bank is making a riskier loan, then it should hold more capital in reserve than if it was making a safe loan. But how do you determine which loan is risky and which is safe?

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And even if you figure that out, then how much more capital should a bank hold for a risky loan than for a safer loan?

BLUMBERG: And while we're at it, what counts as capital? What counts as a safe way to hold capital in reserve? So for example, do you have to hold capital in cash? Do you have to have a big pile of money sitting in a vault or in your account? Or is it OK to hold Treasury bonds? And if it's OK to hold Treasury bonds, is it okay to hold AAA-rated securities as capital?

GOLDSTEIN: So as we start out with what sounds simple and it very quickly gets complicated, we come up on this broader issue with regulation, right? On the one hand, you say the world is a complicated place. The world is a nuanced place. And regulations need to be nuanced and specific to reflect that. But on the other hand, as regulations get more complicated, it gets easier for banks to game the system.

BLUMBERG: And we saw this quite a bit with the last round of Basel rules. So as we said, the Basel committee meets regularly, and every once in a while, they do a big overhaul of the rules. And so this last happened in the early part of the 2000s. And they came up with their final rules in 2004. They went into effect in different countries in 2005 and 2006. And they utterly failed to stop the financial crisis. And one theory is that, yeah, those complicated rules, that was a perfect opportunity for banks to game the system. It was a perfect opportunity for banks to take on more risk and hide it from regulators through these complicated rules. I ran this idea by Gerry Corrigan at Goldman Sachs. And remember; he's the one fishing in the mountains, and he was a regulator for many years as well.

CORRIGAN: There is some truth to that. There clearly is some truth to that. Well, let me give you, again, a simple example, though not much is simple here. The key to the Basel arithmetic, if I can use that term, is you have to come up with a measure of so-called risk-weighted assets.

BLUMBERG: All right. So actually, Jacob, this turned out to be not such a simple example.

GOLDSTEIN: Surprise.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) So let me - but been very interesting. So I'm just going to summarize what he said. So basically, he was saying for a bank, assets - remember - are loans. And some loans are riskier than others, but it's hard to judge often how risky. And so a lot of banks have their own internal risk models. They use these models to judge the risks, and then that helps them determine how much capital to hold against that risk. And the Basel rules permit this.

GOLDSTEIN: So let's just be clear here. What Gerry Corrigan is telling us is that the Basel rules, these key regulations, let the banks themselves decide how risky their loans are and let the banks themselves say, this is how much of a safety cushion we need.

BLUMBERG: But the regulators are supposed to check the models that the banks are using. And so the theory is the banks are better at assessing their own risk but that the regulators should check their models. But of course, remember; each bank is different, and each bank is using a slightly different model. So as Gerry Corrigan was saying, the regulators have to be very sophisticated. They have to understand each bank and its proprietary model. And then this has to be coordinated with regulators all across Asia, Europe and the Americas - well, you get the idea.

CORRIGAN: If you just kind of, in your mind's eye, think about the way that has to work across all major internationally active banking institutions, it's obviously pretty complicated.

BLUMBERG: So the new round of Basel rules are supposed to be finalized this November of this year. And the overall approach, trying to, like, measure risk and accurately assess it in a nuanced way, that hasn't really changed. But people I talked to did say that there's lots of things in the new rules that will make banks safer. For example, the new rules will impose an overall leverage requirement that will make a minimum capital standard to apply to banks no matter how safe they say their assets are. It will also create tighter rules about what counts as capital, what banks can say they're holding to keep them safe. There are lots of small and large changes like that.

CORRIGAN: Finally, it will be more rigorous and more demanding than they have been in the past. And that's exactly what we need.

BLUMBERG: And so you think it stops a future financial crisis like the one we had?

CORRIGAN: Well, no, I would never say that.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Well, what are we thinking about, then?

CORRIGAN: Well, the financial crises are the result of collective human behavior. What we can do is to reduce the probability or the likelihood of these things occurring in the future. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking that we have come up with some magic silver bullet that will control collective human behavior.

BLUMBERG: So, Jacob, this is the problem I always have with doing stories about regulation is that, like, it's - the answer that you can arrive at is always very frustrating. It's always about - it's never, like, a cut and dry - we have stopped the problem; we've solved the problem. It's always like, well, we've mitigated the risk of the problem occurring in somewhere in the foreseen (ph) future slightly more than perhaps we would have mitigated otherwise. You know what I mean?

GOLDSTEIN: Right. Sure. I mean, it can even be less satisfying than that because it's, like, well, you know, we're trying to balance stiffer regulation against economic growth. And we - you know, banks need to be able to lend money, but we don't want them to lend too much money if they don't have enough capital. I mean, you did make it nice and sexy up at the top of the podcast. But, like, once you start digging into this stuff, you can say, yes, it's super important, but, you know, exactly what it means and exactly what the outcome will be always ends up being not so sexy.

BLUMBERG: Right. Because you are always operating - basically, every answer lies on this one spectrum. If you wanted banks to be perfectly safe, you would never let them lend money in the first place.

GOLDSTEIN: (Laughter) Right. The way to not have financial crises is to not have a financial system. And that's - (inaudible) - off the table.

BLUMBERG: So given that banks are going to lend money, there's some risk inherent.

GOLDSTEIN: And that that's basically a good thing, right?

BLUMBERG: Yes.

GOLDSTEIN: I mean, having a financial system means there is a possibility of another financial crisis. So you're just sort of on the spectrum.

SPOON: (Singing) I'm not standing here. Oh, I'm not standing here. And I'm writing in reverse. I know it could be worse. I hear that famous song. And I hear that can't be wrong. Look out.

GOLDSTEIN: We do have those papers from the regulators and from the banks on our blog, npr.org/money.

BLUMBERG: And email us your fixes for the global financial system at planetmoney@npr.org.

I'm Alex Blumberg.

**faster whisper:**
Know you have to go. Let me last thing is can we go to that meeting in July? No, okay?
Okay, thanks a lot for your time sure
I'm writing this to you in reverse
Someone better call a hearse
See it all from here from just a few glimpses now that light bulb's gone off
pulling my wincing
Everyone welcome to Planet Money. I'm Alex Bloomberg, and I'm Jacob Goldstein today's Tuesday August 24th
And that was me you heard at the top getting shot down by a guy named Stephen Chiquetti who?
Despite what you heard is actually a really nice guy right and we are going to be hearing from Stephen Chiquetti today because
He figures heavily in today's podcast. We are going to be talking about a shadowy
International network of financial elites who gather in secret meetings at a small town in Switzerland to decide the fate of the world's financial
system
Jacob that's as sexy as I could make the Basel Committee on banking supervision sound. How do you think I did?
I think you made it sound sexy as hell Alex and and I actually don't think you oversold it
I mean
Basel is where these key rules that govern the world's banks are getting hammered out right now
What goes on in Basel is arguably as important for global finance as anything that happens in the US Congress and still most
People have never heard of it until now
Until just a minute from now, okay, because I got to give you the indicator. All right, let's have it
What is it one year?
It would take one year or 12 and a half months if you want to be precise
To sell all of the existing homes that were on the market in the US in July. That's bad, huh?
It's bad, right because you know, obviously this this indicator is a function of supply and demand
There were a lot of houses for sale in the US in July, but nobody nobody was buying
Sales of existing homes actually hit their lowest level in more than a decade
So in a normal scenario the supply of existing homes in the market would take about six months to sell
Twelve months what we have today is is double what's considered normal. That's that's bad
So this looks like a glut and it suggests that house prices have to fall a lot further
It does and you know, if this was just one kind of outlier indicator, he'd say well, it's a fluke
It's just one month
But the pattern for housing has really been pretty consistent across a bunch of different indicators
We saw the market bottom out in the first half of last year
We saw it climb at the end of last year in the beginning of this year
But then in the past few months indicator after indicator has shown that the housing market is turning again. It's falling again
All right enough about housing. Let's move on to global banking. Shall we let's go
All right
So the one thing that everybody agreed or seemed to agree about the financial crisis we just went through was that financial
Institutions did not have enough money set aside as a safety cushion in finance speak
They say banks didn't have enough capital or banks had too much leverage. It is the same thing
They didn't have enough money in reserve to protect them in a downturn

And he mentions one by name
He writes that he'd like to leave it to the quote
Basel Committee on banking supervision to develop an international agreement on the form structure and level of such a leverage ratio
So then the question is what is this Basel committee, right?
Why is Geithner saying let's put this committee in charge of you know
What's arguably the most important piece of reforming the world's financial system?
So I've been trying to answer this question for a while now and the Basel Committee on banking supervision
Broadly you can think of it as the super group of world banking regulators
So four times a year the chief financial regulators from all over the world central banks all over the world
They meet and they coordinate global banking regulation
And so who are these people like from the u.s. You you can think people from the Fed people from the FDIC
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which regulates banks. That's Sheila Bayer Sheila Bayer goes to Basel
So that's the basics but finding out much more than that is very difficult as you yourself found out Jacob right that that clip
At the top was me asking a senior guy affiliated with Basel Steve Cichetti
Could we actually just go to one of these meetings just to watch and his answer was very clear, right?
No, and then so I figured well do the next best thing
I'll call the regulators from the United States who go to these meetings and I'll ask them what it's like
So I called around the Fed the FDIC both of them said no, they won't talk to us on the record about that
So then I tried to find former people former regulators who had been to Basel who could tell me what it's like
And that's what I learned. You should not do a story about Basel in August because everyone was on vacation
I finally did though track down some people who'd been to Basel and could talk about it

No window, this is Barbara Matthews. She's an international financial expert who runs a company called BCM

And then I also talked to a guy named Doug Elliott who's a scholar at Brookings Institution
He was just back from a vacation. There are no windows this way
You have to remember banking regulation is essentially boring. So you don't want windows that would distract you
Anything will distract you so no windows not much else to really focus
on and
You know, you're there with other policy people and regulators and bureaucrats talking about some
fairly

subject matter
As you can imagine is quite complex
To put it mildly. This is Jerry Corrigan. He's currently a managing director at Goldman Sachs
But for many years he was the chairman of the New York Federal Reserve and he chaired the Basel Committee on banking supervision
He talked to me while he was on vacation from his fishing lodge in the mountains in my day
There were probably
25
Or 30 people at the table. I just printed out some random pages from from
From Basel to the final accord and so, you know like page
Page
25 it says for risk weighting purposes short-term assessments are deemed to be issue specific
They can only be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from the rated facility
they cannot be general and you know, you know 250 pages of that type of
That type of language and and at these meetings were you were you picking up this type of language and saying and
arguing about it
Well, we never argued we discussed
So, okay, let's just pause from all these people who are on vacation and talking to you and just step back and look
At what Basel is the Basel Committee has been around meeting in these oval windowless rooms since the late
1970s and you know over the past several decades banking has become more global today
Most of us just small savers. We have our money in banks that operate internationally
So, you know the Basel process has become more important as as the financial system has become more global here's Doug Elliott again
It's basically where the financial bureaucrats around the world are coming together
To decide what the safety margins are that banks have to hold
So if the banks in our system had had more capital when we went through the recent financial crisis
It wouldn't have been nearly as bad and the panic wouldn't have spread as much because we would have known that

Everything hit the fan and it got a lot worse people justifiably panicked
So sure, okay capital requirements are important
We can agree about that but but there's still this question of of why regulate capital requirements in this way
Why leave this super important thing to some little-known group in windowless rooms in Switzerland?
And so the idea here is that the world should have a single set of banking rules

So Steve Cicchetti the guy we heard at the top shooting you down Jacob
He's an economist and he works closely with the Basel process. You have to think about regulation as an arms race
And
You're laughing but I'm serious and the arms race is between the regulators and the supervisors on the one side and the banks

Try and contain the next thing they do
and
If you write the if you write the laws in too restrictive a way
Then what you do is you you tie one hand behind the backs of the regulators and the supervisors in that arms race that they're in
All right. So the two sides in this arms race
They each have weapons and the weapons are made of paper and math. Here's one
This is the most advanced weapon from the industry side
It's a report from the IIF the Institute of International Finance
Saying that if the Basel rules currently under discussion are passed the world economy will grow much more slowly
You know, it says basically if you make banks hold more money in reserve
They won't lend as much money out people won't be able to buy as much stuff on credit
Businesses won't be able to borrow to start factories to hire people etc
So Jacob boom
What do you say to that?
It's not about what I say Alex
It's about what you can in his people say and you know, you may not be surprised to learn they have their own bomb
They say in their own report
You know what hurts economic growth great big financial crises like the one we just had
So in the long term if you make banks safer, we have fewer
Great big financial crises that'll be good for the economy. It'll be good for jobs. It'll be good for all the rest, right?
Now this all sounds very simple making banks safer
But when you get into it this arms race boils down to a lot of super technical details and decisions to make so for example
If a bank is making a riskier loan, then it should hold more capital and reserve than if it was making a safe loan
But how do you determine which loan is risky and which is safe?
Right and even if you figure that out then how much more
Capital should a bank hold for a risky loan than for a safer loan and while we're at it
What counts as capital what counts as a safe way to hold capital and reserve?
So for example, do you have to hold capital in cash?
Do you have to have a big pile of money sitting in a vault or in your account?
Or is it okay to hold Treasury bonds? And if it's okay to hold Treasury bonds, is it okay to hold triple a rated?
Securities as capital so as as we start out with what sounds simple and and it very quickly gets complicated
We come up on this this broader issue with regulation, right?
On the one hand you say the world is a complicated place
The world is a nuanced place and and regulations need to be nuanced and specific to reflect that but on the other hand as
Regulations get more complicated. It gets easier for banks to game the system and we saw this quite a bit with the last round of
Basel rules. So as we said the Basel committee meets
Regularly and every once in a while they do a big overhaul of the rules
And so this last happened in the early part of the 2000s and they came up with their final rules in
2004 they went into effect in different countries in 2005 and 2006 and
They utterly failed to stop the financial crisis and one theory is that yeah those complicated rules. That was a perfect
Opportunity for banks to game the system
It was a perfect opportunity for banks to take on more risk and hide it from regulators through these complicated rules
I ran this idea by Jerry Corrigan at Goldman Sachs and remember
He's the one fishing in the mountains and he was a regulator for many years as well
It clearly is some truth to that
Let me give you a simple example
Not much is simple here
the key to
the Basel arithmetic if I can use that term is
You have to come up with a measure of so-called risk weighted assets
All right, so actually Jacob this turned out to be not such a simple example surprise
So let me but it been very interesting. So I'm just gonna summarize what he said
So basically he was saying for a bank assets
Remember our loans and some loans are riskier than others
But it's hard to judge often how risky and so a lot of banks have their own
Internal risk models they use these models to judge the risks and then that helps them determine how much capital
To hold against that risk and the Basel rules permit this
So so let's just be clear here. What what Jerry Corrigan is is telling us is that the Basel rules these key regulations
Let the banks themselves decide how risky their loans are and let the banks themselves say
This is how much of a safety cushion we need
But the regulators are supposed to check the models that the banks are using
And so the theory is the banks are better at assessing their own risk, but that the regulator should check their models
But of course remember each bank is different and each bank is using a slightly different model
so as Jerry Corrigan was saying the regulators have to be very sophisticated they have to understand each bank and its proprietary model and
Then this has to be coordinated with regulators all across Asia Europe and America as well. You get the idea
If you just kind of in your mind's eye
Think about the way that has to work
Across all major
International the active banking institutions, it's obviously pretty complicated
so the new round of Basel rules are supposed to be finalized this November of this year and the overall approach trying to like
Measure risk and accurately assess it in a nuanced way that hasn't really changed
But people I talked to did say that there's lots of things in the new rules that will make that will make banks safer
For example the new rules will impose an overall leverage requirement that will make a minimum capital standard
To apply to banks no matter how safe they say their assets are it will also create tighter rules about what counts as capital
What banks can say they're holding to keep them safe?
There are lots of small and large changes like that
Plainly will be more rigorous and more demanding than they have been in the past
And that's exactly what we need and so you think it stops a future financial crisis like the one we had
The result of collective human behavior
What we can do
Is to reduce
the probability or the likelihood of
These things occurring in the future
But let's not get ourselves into thinking that we have come up with
some magic silver bullet
That will control
collective human behavior
So Jacob this is the problem I always have with doing stories about regulation is that like it's the answer that you can arrive
At is always very frustrating. It's always about
It's never like a cut-and-dry. We have stopped the problem. We've solved the problem
It's always like well
We've mitigated the risk of the problem occurring in the in some world-enforcing future slightly more than perhaps we would have mitigated
Otherwise, I mean it can even be less satisfying than that because it's like well
You know, we're trying to balance stiffer regulation against economic growth and we you know banks need to be able to lend money
But we don't want them to lend too much money if they don't have enough capital
I mean you did make it nice and sexy up at the top of the podcast
But like once you start digging into this stuff, you can say yes, it's super important
But you know exactly what it means and exactly what the outcome will be always ends up being
Not so sexy, right
Because you are always operating basically every answer lies on this one spectrum
If you wanted banks to be perfectly safe, you would never let them lend money in the first place
The way to not have financial crisis is to not have a financial system
So given that banks are going to lend money, there's some risk and learn. That's basically a good thing
I mean having a financial system means there is a possibility of another financial crisis. So you're just sort of on this spectrum
