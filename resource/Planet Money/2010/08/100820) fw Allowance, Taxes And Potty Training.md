It's really, really hard to create the right kind of economic incentives -- even if you're a professional economist, and all you're trying to do is teach your kids to use the toilet. On today's Planet Money, we talk to Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Melbourne -- and his 11-year-old daughter. He explains the system he constructed and rules he enforced. But like tiny Wall-Street bankers, the kids figured out how to work the system for maximum advantage.

ROBERT SIEGEL, host:

Economists love to complain that politicians don't pay enough attention to economic incentives when they write laws. Our Planet Money team hears this criticism so often that it's taken to asking economists: How would you run things?

Well, today, Chana Joffe-Walt introduces us to an economist who is trying to run his own economically pure society, his family.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT: The first opportunity Joshua Gans had to test the power of economic incentives in a controlled environment came when his daughter, B., was 2. Joshua's an economist, an expert in incentives. He talks about them all the time in the classroom at the University of Melbourne.

So his daughter B. was 2, and in diapers. Joshua wanted her not to be in diapers anymore. B. was perfectly happy with the system that existed. So Joshua designed an incentive: B. would receive a jelly bean every time she went to the toilet. New policy in place, B. suddenly had to go to the toilet a lot.

A few years later, her brother needed to be potty trained. And B., who is now 11 years old, jumped into the incentive system once again.

Ms. B. GANS: Oh, I remember that.

(Soundbite of laughter)

Professor JOSHUA GANS (Management Information, Melbourne Business School): You want to say what happened when your brother was toilet-trained?

Ms. GANS: Well, I realized that if I helped my brother go to the toilet, I would get rewarded, too. So I realized that the more that goes in, the more comes out. So I was just feeding my brother buckets and buckets of water until, I guess...

(Soundbite of laughter)

Ms. GANS: Yes.

Mr. GANS: That was my idea. It didn't really work out too well.

JOFFE-WALT: As B. grew up, Joshua faced a new problem. She wanted things: yo-yos, candy. She went on a tear about needing some Heeleys, those shoes with wheels on them. So Joshua began to think about a new economic tool, allowance.

Parents generally use allowance in two ways: As a reward for services provided such as using the toilet or, say, washing dishes or making the bed. Joshua had ruled that way out after B. pumped her brother full of water.

So the second approach to allowance is to use it as a tool to teach kids budget constraints. Joshua told B.: Okay, anything you want that is nonessential, you buy it with your own allowance.

Mr. GANS: However, that just doesn't quite occur. A child comes forward with a very nice dress that she's found in the store, and we think: Oh, we agree that's nice as well. And all of a sudden, the credit card's out.

JOFFE-WALT: If she comes forward with a dress that you don't like, then it has to go through allowance?

Mr. GANS: Ah, ones we - yes, ones we don't like, then it's far more likely to go straight to the allowance.

JOFFE-WALT: But that seems like that gets in the way of the idea of teaching budget constraints, right? If you have arbitrary rules about what you have to pay for yourself and what your parents pay for.

Mr. GANS: It is very difficult indeed.

JOFFE-WALT: This, it turns out, is a problem governments in a free market face all the time. People in society want things leaders don't always like - things that harm the environment, things that are bad for society, like drugs or candy. B. tells me her dad has a rule about candy.

Ms. GANS: If you want to buy candy with your allowance, you have to pay to your parents and 100 percent health tax.

JOFFE-WALT: Just as Joshua subsidizes dresses he likes, he taxes candy. He tried to calculate how much B.'s candy consumption would add to his health costs, for instance, increased dental visits, say, and he landed at 100 percent, it's a pretty hefty tax. But you know what? It worked.

Mr. GANS: That's it. I've no revenue from the health tax whatsoever which is a bit of a shame...

(Soundbite of laughter)

Mr. GANS: ...because this might have been the way to claw back the enormous allowance that she's getting.

(Soundbite of laughter)

JOFFE-WALT: You've never paid the health tax?

Ms. GANS: Never ever.

(Soundbite of laughter)

Ms. GANS: I realized, well, that's just a rip-off. Why would I want the candy then?

JOFFE-WALT: Of course, just as people evade government regulation by crossing state lines for cigarettes or fireworks, B. can go to her grandmother's for tax-free candy. Economists call this leakage.

Parents can design their own rules, but the scarce resource of a parent and governments, for that matter, too, is attention. Two-year-olds seem to have unlimited time to figure out how to use regulation to their benefit. That's something they share with, say, bankers.

Mr. GANS: When it comes down to it, the policies need constant adjustment. It's actually an issue of management rather than just setting the parameters correctly.

JOFFE-WALT: Joshua, still an economist and a parent, remains faithful to the idea of incentives driving behavior. But he's a little more weary about his ability to use them to get what he wants.

**faster whisper:**
I'm not giving you money for walking around doing nothing.
An allowance? I allow you to sleep here at night.
I allow you to eat them potatoes.
I allow you to use my lights.
I allow you to drink my Kool-Aid.
I brush my teeth and look in the mirror
and laugh out loud as I'm beaming from ear to ear.
I'd rather pick flowers.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Fana Jaffee-Walth. Today is Friday, August 20th.
And that was a clip from the TV series,
Everybody Hates Chris, you heard at the top of the show.
And on the podcast today,
turning time spent with your little brother into billable hours.
In other words, what happens when an economist pays an allowance to his kids?
But first, our indicator from Jacob Goldstein.
Jacob, what do you got for us?
I've got for you 0.47%.
That is the yield on two-year treasuries as of this morning,
and it's an all-time low.
Okay, so just to be clear, yields,
this means that if you lend the government $100 for two years,
they will pay you 47 cents a year in interest,
which is amazingly low.
Inflation is around 1% a year.
So the $101 you would get from this investment two years from now
will actually buy you less stuff than $100 today.
And what this means more broadly, right,
is investors think the future of the economy is really pretty bleak.
They expect inflation to be very low.
That tends to correspond to slow economic growth.
And more generally,
treasuries are considered one of the safest investments in the world.
People buy them when they're afraid to buy stocks
and when they're worried about the economy overall.
And the fact that yields on treasuries are so low means,
in effect, there's a whole bunch of people that want to buy treasuries.
And this has sparked a debate about
whether or not there's actually a bubble in treasuries.
And it's really pretty striking, right?
The whole idea that there even could be a bubble in treasuries,
it's kind of weird because you think of this as this super boring,
super safe investment, not some kind of go-go Las Vegas subdivision
that people are going to flip.
And the very existence of this debate, I think,
points to how worried people are about the economy
and how willing people are to buy treasuries
in spite of these ultra-low yields.
Of course, houses used to be something that was considered
very safe and boring as well.
Safe as houses, wasn't that an expression?
I think that was a phrase, exactly.
Safe as treasuries.
Well, thank you very much, Jacob.
It was a pleasure, as always.
Thanks, guys.
All right, Hannah.
On to the podcast, to a world free of politicians
where economists get the chance to live the way they want.
Right.
We spend a lot of time hearing economists bemoan
how politicians are constantly mucking up
what would otherwise be perfectly good economic policy.
I've done many interviews with economists telling us,
basically, we're giving great advice to politicians.
We write these great papers.
We advise them.
Time after time, climate change, health care, taxes,
politicians ignore our basic economic principles
when they design their policies.
And most importantly, they say politicians don't pay
attention to incentives as a way of getting people
to do what you want or accidental incentives
where you're encouraging people accidentally
to do something you don't want.
So today on our podcast, an economist actually gets
to write all his own rules for once.
In an environment he completely controls
his own personal economics laboratory.
And he gets to try to enforce them.
We sat down with him and his collaborator to talk about it.
How are you doing?
I'm well, thank you.
How are you?
Good.
Thank you for coming in.
And who's that person sitting next to you?
Daddy.
Hi.
How are you?
Good.
How are you doing?
All right.
That giggling there is Bea.
Bea, she's an 11-year-old.
And the guy she calls Daddy is also sometimes known as.
Joshua Gans, economics professor at Melbourne Business School.
So Alex Joshua is an economist from Melbourne, Australia.
And he's visiting this year at Harvard.
And he is 11 years into his experiment,
running his own economically pure world,
implementing all the principles at his disposal
to influence the behavior of society.
And in this case, society is a small one.
It's his own family.
Bea is his oldest of three kids.
Now, his first opportunity to use the power of economics to improve society,
in other words, to improve the behavior of his children,
came when Bea was two and unfortunately still in diapers.
The authorities, he and his wife, were getting tired of cleaning up after Bea.
But Bea was perfectly happy with the system that existed.
This provided Joshua with his first opportunity
to change her behavior with properly structured incentives.
We actually gave her a reward for when she was toilet training.
We gave her a reward for, you know,
sitting on the toilet to get used to the whole thing.
And it used to be the reward of jelly beans.
And she worked out that all she had to do was sit there all day, if necessary.
And something would eventually happen and she'd get a reward.
Bea, do you remember that?
Well, I do remember playing my parents.
I don't remember that exact example, but I do remember playing.
I do remember realizing the tricks and using them
to get jelly beans and chocolate frogs and stuff.
What did you do?
Well, my sister noticed she got a special treat every time anything came out.
And so she'd go every 20 minutes
and somehow she managed to squeeze something out every 20 minutes.
So every 20 minutes she was getting candy every 20 minutes.
You invented that one.
Yeah, okay, I invented that one.
I don't particularly remember it, but yes.
Actually, Bea did something more insidious when her brother was toilet training.
Oh, I remember that.
You want to say what happened when your brother was toilet training?
Well, I realized that if I helped my brother go to the toilet,
I would get rewarded too.
And I realized that the more that goes in, the more comes out.
So I was just feeding my brother buckets and buckets of water.
That was my idea.
It didn't really work out too well.
The idea was to get everybody involved in cooperation
in this public activity of her brother's toilet training.
And so she got a reward as well for success.
Unfortunately, as you hear, she gamed the system.
So this is the problem you hear about all the time in the real world.
You design an incentive system, but you can't guarantee
that the people won't abuse that system.
Are they trading in their own clunker for cash
or are they trading in somebody else's clunker?
Is it really a clunker?
Are people using the tax break to build the middle income housing?
Are they using it for luxury condos?
It's this problem that exists in the real world all the time.
And you often hear about that it's really hard to get the price
of the incentive right.
And I mean, in this scenario, not only did B learn the rules
to game the system, it took Joshua three children
to truly learn the right price.
So he tried one jelly bean to get the kids to use the bathroom,
then that wasn't enough.
Then two jelly beans still turned out to be too low.
And it wasn't until the third child that Joshua hit on the right price,
which apparently was a chocolate frog.
A chocolate frog?
Well, everybody knows that, a chocolate frog.
But it wasn't just jelly beans and chocolate frogs.
Joshua had another tool in his economics toolkit
to help influence the behavior in his family.
I refer, of course, to the allowance.
Or as this paper from the Journal of Economic Psychology calls it,
Alex, an intergenerational transfer payment.
Are you telling me there's an economics literature on allowances?
There are at least six papers on the economics of allowance
that I have read and I'm sure there are more.
And basically, they all have one thing in common,
which is that they all kind of outline the motives for paying an allowance.
And there are sort of two main ones.
One is as an exchange for service provided.
So, you know, you wash the dishes or walk the dog,
clean your room, you get an allowance.
And the other motive would be to teach budget constraint.
Which I guess is economics for teaching kids
that money doesn't grow on trees.
That's another way of saying it.
They do not use those words in these papers.
So this second motive seemed like it would be really useful
for Joshua around the time B was five
because she was constantly asking for things.
They'd go to stores, she wanted yo-yos,
or she went on a tear about needing heelies,
which are those shoes with wheels on them.
Yeah, I have a couple pairs.
You don't.
And then there was one thing that she wanted all the time.
Yeah, I have a bit of a candy problem.
So Joshua said to B,
okay, if there are things that you want that are not necessities,
you'll have to buy them with your allowance.
And I'll give you an allowance, $5 a week.
And at first, things were going really great.
The first thing she did was actually spend it
on a present for her mother.
Do you remember what it cost?
$5.
So I spent all my allowance on a little key ring for Mommy,
which she still has, except it's kind of fallen apart.
But she won't give it up.
Which I thought was...
which we all got a warm glow as parents
from that nice activity.
What things are covered by allowance and what things aren't?
Our vision with all of this
was that we would be the hard-nosed parents,
we'd set this allowance,
and that we'd say no every single time
a child expressed a preference for something.
However, that just doesn't quite occur.
A child comes forward with a very nice dress
that she's found in a store,
and we think, oh, we agree that's nice as well,
and all of a sudden the credit card's out.
So we haven't quite got to the vision.
But then if she comes forward with a dress that you don't like,
then it has to go to the allowance?
Yes.
Once we don't like,
then it's far more likely to go straight to the allowance.
Although some of those,
especially for our youngest child, are truly horrific,
and I'm not even sure an allowance is going to cover it.
But that seems like that gets in the way
of the idea of teaching budget constraint, right?
If you have arbitrary rules about what you have to pay for yourself,
and what your parents pay for it.
Yes. No, it does.
It is very difficult indeed.
This is one of the problems with parenting in general,
and also with economics,
is that you have plans, you have theories,
you want to stick to it, commit to it,
and you know that if you do that, it'll all work out.
The problem is that you have to implement it,
and that can be really quite difficult,
especially in a moment-by-moment thing.
It sounds like in the system what he ended up teaching was
these are the kinds of dresses that I like,
and if you buy the kind of dresses I like, go get them for free.
Right, as opposed to saving and not spending all of your money.
So this is a problem governments and authorities in a free market
also face all the time.
People in society want things that the leaders don't like,
things that are bad for society or harm the environment.
In Joshua's society, it was the same.
His daughter wanted ugly dresses,
she wanted tons of Harry Potter paraphernalia,
and candy, lots and lots of candy.
But fortunately, there is a great economic tool for that as well,
and here it is described very happily by Bea.
If you want to buy candy with your allowance,
you have to pay to your parents and 100% health tax.
Taxes.
That's right.
So this 100%, Alex, it might sound arbitrary, it is not.
Joshua tried to calculate how much he needed to collect in taxes
to compensate himself and his wife
for any additional expected health costs of this candy consumption.
100%, that's a pretty hefty tax, but you know what?
It seems to have worked.
That said, I've earned no revenue from the health tax whatsoever,
which is a bit of a shame,
because this might have been a way to claw back
the enormous allowance that she's getting.
You've never paid the health tax?
Never.
I realise, well, that's just a rip-off.
Why would I want the candy then?
That's a pointless thing.
And I think she has forecast that if she started buying candy
at the 100% tax rate,
that we might put up the rate of taxes,
and she's probably right.
Now, of course, it's illustrating another poor bit of economics
in that we're not just relying on education
to have our daughter make these decisions,
but in some sense imposing our will through the tax on her.
Because a more free-market economist would say
if she understands the risks of eating candy,
then she should be allowed to make that choice for herself.
That's right.
But I guess we're not convinced that she quite understands those risks,
despite her ability to articulate them.
I think, actually, if we drop the health tax tomorrow,
I think a eating binge would occur.
That's, of course, another way of educating on these things,
but we haven't quite gone that far yet.
This is a pretty serious nanny state
that this economist has got going on his dream world.
I know.
So you have arbitrary rules and decisions
about when you can and can't spend your own money
on Harry Potter posters.
There are subsidies enforcing an arbitrary dress code.
I know.
I know you can only get the dress if he likes it.
And he will match allowance money for books
or things that he deems to have educational benefit,
as opposed to the health costs that he sees in things like candy.
And so what started as a simple economics experiment at home
has evolved into this really complicated system
with taxes and incentives and subsidies.
And Joshua also faces this problem that economists call leakage,
where people can go outside the system and get things cheaper.
So just like people can cross state lines, for example,
to get cigarettes or fireworks cheaper than they could in their own state,
Bea can go to her grandmother's house for tax free candy.
Yeah, to get candy or to birthday parties,
I would assume is also a form of leakage.
And then there's the most basic problem of all,
which Joshua has actually never really solved.
How much to pay? What is an appropriate amount to pay for the allowance?
Because at this point, Bea is 11 years old,
and he just set up the system where you get paid a dollar per year,
so she gets $11 a week,
and she's built up quite a lot of savings.
As soon as I turned about nine,
I realized that's actually quite a bit of money.
When I put it, if there are 52 weeks in a year,
you multiply, and as soon as I'll be 10,
and then I'll be getting $520 a year.
I'm like, yay! That was pretty cool.
I'm thinking I have a shot.
Now you think you're overpaid.
Well, it wasn't our intention that she was going to save the money
as much as she does,
especially given the demand for cash that we usually were receiving from her.
Joshua says when he sat down to design this system,
the point was to teach Bea budget constraint,
and now he's thinking that she learned that so quickly
that he could have gotten away with paying her a lot less.
Like, all the excess saving means he could have taught her
everything he wanted to teach her for way less of his own money.
In economic terms, he wasn't very efficient with his incentives.
Not at all.
I've been working on this story about Basel,
which is this town in Switzerland where the world's banking regulators
gather to come up with new rules for the banking system.
But what's happening in Basel reminds me a lot
of what's going on in the Gans family home.
They're coming up with all these incentives,
but the rules are being gamed.
It's hard to get the incentives right.
What are the proper amounts?
They're all wrestling with the same stuff in Basel.
Yeah, I mean, Joshua says two-year-olds versus parents
are very similar to bankers versus regulators.
The problem is that that actually is not a just
set it and forget it policy.
That's something you have to manage and think about all the time.
And when it comes down to it, that's the scarce resort a parent has.
They don't have the attention to continually manage these things,
whereas it seems the children have unlimited time
to think about how to game the system.
One of the things the governments get trapped on
is that they come up with policies
that they think are going to solve the whole problem.
But when it comes down to it, the policies need constant adjustment.
It's actually an issue of management
rather than just setting the parameters correctly.
Alex?
Yes?
You're a new dad?
I am.
Good luck, man.
Thank you. Thank you. I guess I'm going to need it.
If you're looking to learn more about the economics of allowance,
we're going to link to Joshua Gantz's book, Parentonomics.
I think I'm saying it correctly on our blog, npr.org slash money.
And let us know what you think about allowances
and incentives for kids in general
or how your parents incentivized you.
Was it with allowances or incentives for kids in general?
I think it was with allowances and incentives for kids in general.
I think it was with allowances and incentives for kids in general.
I think my parents incentivized you.
Was it with allowance or was it with spanking?
Or praise.
Or praise.
Oh, right, praise.
We'd love to hear from you at our Facebook page,

I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Hannah Joffe-Walt.
Thanks for listening.
Thank you.
