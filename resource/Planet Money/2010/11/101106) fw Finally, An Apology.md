For two years, we've waited for someone from the financial world to apologize for their role the financial crisis. On today's Planet Money, Jacob Kosoff steps up. Kosoff used to work as an economist for Freddie Mac, and his job was to promote homeownership. He managed an online calculator designed to help people determine whether to rent or buy a house. But Kosoff says there's a big problem with the calculator -- and he's sorry he didn't work harder to fix it.

A former Freddie Mac economist.
Jacob Kosoff

Kosoff used to work as an economist for Freddie Mac's "Mission Department." His job was to promote homeownership, and he was really good at it.

He managed an online calculator designed to help people determine whether to rent or buy a house. Kosoff says there's a big problem with that calculator (which is still online), and he's sorry he didn't work harder to fix it.

It doesn't allow for the possibility that the value of a house might fall over time.
Rent v. Buy
Freddie Mac

That got us wondering: What would a proper calculator to help people decide whether they should buy or rent look like?

So we called up Christopher Mayer, a professor of real-estate finance, thinking he would have the spreadsheets and formulas we were looking for.

He didn't. Mayer says answering this question is only partly about math. A lot of it is psychological.

    The value of a home is the the value you get from living in it and two different people are going to get two different values from the same home. It's a very individual decision.

That said, Mayer still agreed to help tackle this question with a couple of our listeners. Here are some highlights from those conversations:

Richard H.

    I live in Pittsburgh, PA, and I currently rent.  I can definitely get more "house for my money" if I buy.  Pittsburgh is full of great houses.  In fact, I think Pittsburgh was recently ranked as one of the best places to make that switch, as well as being a great place to relocate to.  But, I've never owned before.  I'm also trying to figure out if it makes sense from a tax perspective.  Anyway, Pittsburgh has not been as hit by the bursting of the bubble as a lot of other places (largely because it was not as impacted by the bubble - although I believe it has one of the highest rates of prosecutions for mortgage fraud recently - go figure).  But, home prices have gone down and I'm thinking that the metaphorical iron might be hot right about now.

Brian B.

    I've always enjoyed the flexibility of renting for the last 10 years in DC; however, I just got married 4 months ago. My wife, who turned me on to Planet Money, tells me a month ago she would like to own a place (paint walls, etc) when our lease ends in May. We are now doing the math, and I'm open for anything. I'm still leaning towards renting while she's going to open houses. We have enough for decent down payment, and she's got near perfect credit.

Mark B.

    We own our home and hope to retire soon. When we do we intend to move to Colorado and are seriously considering renting at that time. I certainly wouldn't sign any loan papers without an independent legal review. My calculations show that deferring the cost of purchasing a home outright (paying cash) and instead placing the money in a conservative investment would improve our net worth over time. I still need to evaluate the tax implications.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We've now seen private sector job growth for 10 straight months. That means that since January, the private sector has added 1.1 million jobs.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LION'S TEETH")

THE MOUNTAIN GOATS: (Singing) The king of the jungle was asleep in his car. When your chances fall in your lap like that, you got to recognize them for what they really are.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

And I'm Adam Davidson. Today is Friday, Nov. 5. And that was, of course, President Obama you heard at the top of the show speaking this morning to the press. Today on the podcast, we bring you something we have been searching for desperately, tirelessly for two years - an apology. We bring you a person who works in finance who actually would like to apologize to each and every one of you for the housing crisis in general and his role in it.

JOFFE-WALT: And there's one more thing he'd like to say to all of us - thank you. Thank you for the bailout. That is coming up, but first, our indicator from Jacob Julius Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 4.7%. That's the unemployment rate for people with a college degree, according to the jobs numbers the government put out today. Now, the number we've been hearing everywhere today is 9.6%. That's the overall unemployment rate, the headline number. But, you know, it's interesting. When you dig into these jobs numbers, you see these very different stories. Like, one really striking one is if you compare high school dropouts to college grads. So just a reminder, college grads, the unemployment rate - just under 5%. High school dropouts, the unemployment rate is over 15%.

DAVIDSON: Wow. It's like high school dropouts and college graduates are living in two totally different countries. College graduates are barely in an economic slowdown at all. More than 95% have jobs. And high school dropouts - I mean, that's verging on Great Depression unemployment rates.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, it's really striking, although it's worth noting that, even in good times for this country, the unemployment rate is way higher for high school dropouts than for college grads. And in fact, if you look over the past few years, the unemployment rate has basically doubled for both of these groups. You can see this trend and a bunch of other interesting job trends on our blog. Our production assistant, Jess Jiang, put up some great graphs. The blog is npr.org/money, of course.

JOFFE-WALT: Nice. Thank you, Jacob.

DAVIDSON: Thanks, Jacob. Great plug for the blog.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

DAVIDSON: So, Chana, today's podcast is all a result of this pretty remarkable email that I got a few weeks ago. It was in response to a piece I did on "This American Life" with Ira a few weeks back. Basically, there's this question we have here at PLANET MONEY. Why aren't people on Wall Street at least a little bit grateful? You know, it's pretty clear that in the fall of 2008, most major firms on Wall Street would have collapsed if us taxpayers didn't bail them out. I think that's a fairly uncontroversial thing to say. Yet when we interview people who work on Wall Street, people who work in these financial firms, their attitude is, I mean, I'd say almost never one of gratitude to us taxpayers, to the government.

JOFFE-WALT: And as an illustration of this, on the show "This American Life," you and a producer from the show went to this bar in the heart of the financial district, a place called Pound & Pence, to talk to people there.

DAVIDSON: And I do want to say quickly that at this point in the tape, we had been arguing for quite some time, trying to see if they had any gratitude at all to the U.S. government and U.S. taxpayers.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So let's hear an excerpt.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "THIS AMERICAN LIFE")

DAVIDSON: So you're an institutional investor. You work for a credit rating agency. What do you do?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I work in a bank on Wall Street.

DAVIDSON: All right. I can guarantee your bank would have gone under. Your stock valuation would have collapsed. Your credit rating agencies...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Are out of business.

DAVIDSON: ...Would have been out of business. You - all three of you directly benefited from the bailout.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: What?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: You're crazy.

DAVIDSON: How am I crazy?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: You're crazy, babe. So what do you do? Don't bail it out? That's the question. Do you not bail it out?

JANE FELTES: I don't know.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: OK. So you let it tank. It's up to you.

FELTES: I would like to bail it out, and I would like to walk into a bar in lower Manhattan and have one of you thank me. Thank you, I still have my job, and I appreciate it.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Why do you want that?

FELTES: You guys still have your jobs.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Because I'm a smart person.

FELTES: And you think you got to keep your job because you're smart? You got to keep your job because you guys got bailed out. You guys got bailed...

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: No, no, no, no, no. That's not what happened with my job. I mean, survival of the fittest.

DAVIDSON: I'd say these guys are fairly typical of my experience with talking to people who work in finance, who work on Wall Street. Instead of an apology, instead of a thank you, we get the opposite. They say, oh, the government's beating up on us. The taxpayers are yelling at us. It's all this populist rage. And when I aired the story, I - you know, I felt like everyone who works in finance felt this way. But then I got this email and actually, kind of a testy email from one listener.

JACOB KOSOFF: Well, I guess I was a little annoyed that you didn't mentioned some people were, you know, grateful and apologetic.

DAVIDSON: Some people, specifically, like him, Jacob Kosoff. Jacob is indeed a finance guy, although he didn't work on Wall Street. He worked in D.C. as an economist for Freddie Mac. And he told me that my story was wrong, that there are finance people - or at least he had the evidence of one finance person who would like to say thank you and I'm sorry. And so I promised to give him the opportunity, right here and now, to thank each and every one of you listening, at least each and every one of you who is a U.S. taxpayer. He wants you to know he really is grateful.

KOSOFF: I am. Thank you for the - yeah - for a variety of things. Thanks for the government money for Freddie Mac, which I think kept me employed for, you know, a while after that until I voluntarily left. So thank you for the funding for Freddie and Fannie. Thank you for the general bailout, which I think helped all financial firms, or if not all, then most financial firms. And as somebody who works in that industry and applies for jobs at different ones, you know, a lot of the places I applied to may not have existed if it wasn't for the government stepping in.

JOFFE-WALT: So that right there is Jacob's thank you. And, Adam, you and I talked to Jacob for a while. And in addition to expressing his gratitude, he also asked for the opportunity to say he is sorry. And it's a very specific apology. And you realize, talking to him, that it's a really big deal for him to be able to do this, for him to be able to say I'm sorry, and that, in order to get to this point, he had to go through an entire personal transformation that challenged his most fundamental beliefs.

DAVIDSON: Yes. So let's tell the story of his conversion. It all starts in 2007. Jacob was working as a home ownership evangelical missionary. I don't mean that in the religious sense. Although actually, I guess I do kind of mean it in the religious sense. When you hear him talk about what home ownership meant to him, it was like he was in the religion of home ownership. Although professionally, what he was doing was he was an economist at Freddie Mac. Now, Freddie Mac is one of these weird institutions. It's hard to get your head around it. It was started by the U.S. government to promote home ownership, but - at least, until it was taken over by the U.S. government two years ago when it was on the verge of collapse - it was in the private sector. It was a for-profit company that was supposed to serve a public service mission. And Jacob actually worked in something called the mission department.

KOSOFF: So our job is to make sure we achieve the goals of Freddie Mac, which is - there's affordability, stability and liquidity. And specifically in affordability, the government had set affordable housing goals for us. Like, certain percentages of the mortgages that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae bought had to fit certain low-income requirements.

JOFFE-WALT: So here's how Jacob made sure Freddie Mac achieved the goal of broad homeownership. Every month, traders at Freddie Mac would buy up mortgages from financial companies all over the U.S. And this was great for financial companies because they don't want to hold on to all those mortgages. And it was great for Freddie Mac because all that buying meant that they could exert pressure on the country's lenders.

DAVIDSON: So Jacob would look over the details and make sure that enough of these mortgages went to underserved people - poor people, people in bad neighborhoods. And if not, Jacob was able to get Freddie Mac to call those big banks and the mortgage lenders and say, hey, guys, you have to start lending money to more poor people if you want our business.

JOFFE-WALT: Jacob and his colleagues called themselves housers (ph), meaning they believed buying a house is almost always the right solution for everybody.

KOSOFF: I would think I was putting people in housing that wouldn't be in housing and that I thought that subprime mortgages were great and that they were helping people that were low-income that normally couldn't afford to buy a house, buy a house. And I was very supportive. And I thought subprime was the best thing in the world.

JOFFE-WALT: So you guys were the missionizers.

KOSOFF: Yes, we were very into it - into, you know - very much, we were the true believers.

JOFFE-WALT: So what's amazing about that is that Jacob was promoting subprime mortgages after lots of other people in finance were saying, hey, there's a subprime housing bubble, and it's popping.

DAVIDSON: When did you start working there? What year?

KOSOFF: January 2007.

DAVIDSON: So...

JOFFE-WALT: That's a crazy time to start working there.

KOSOFF: Yeah, exactly.

DAVIDSON: So, I mean, that's - you know, we feel we've established that at least some folks on Wall Street were pretty clear that the bubble was close to popping. But was that not what you knew?

KOSOFF: Yeah, I missed that memo. Yeah, I did not think house prices were popping. I was ready to go. I was like, we need to buy more. Even in the summer of '07, I was very supportive.

JOFFE-WALT: It wasn't until the fall of 2007 that Jacob Kosoff started to have some uncomfortable thoughts. He remembers one weekend he went to a conference, and there were a lot of housers there, lots of people he knew. And that is when it first happened.

KOSOFF: I don't know if there was a specific speaker or a specific paper I read, but that's the first time I started even thinking that you could compare house prices to rents. Like, I remember that clicked in my head. I was like, oh, someone could pay 2,000 a month in a mortgage. Maybe the rent would be a thousand. Maybe that'd be a better deal for the same place. And that was the first time I thought maybe there could be some times ever in your life possibly that renting could maybe be better.

DAVIDSON: So remarkably, this thought had never occurred to him before. But once it entered his brain, it wouldn't leave him alone. The uncomfortable thoughts kept coming.

KOSOFF: I remember then I started trying to do some of the math myself. I was like, oh, well, maybe the benefit of house price appreciation on average really isn't so good because, except for the boom years, that cancels out with all the maintenance costs you put in. And then I stepped back and thought, you know what? A mortgage is really just 80% interest. And interest, like rent, is the right to live somewhere you don't own. And I was like, wow, the rents are lower than the mortgage for all these places. It was a bit like announcing, like, oh, there is no God. Like, the idea that housing was like God. It was like, of course it goes up. Of course it's a great deal. While everyone else said, no, no, no, we need to favor homeownership, favor homeownership. Buying is always better. So I felt very much like an outsider - like an outsider to my friends, but also an outsider to myself. Like, is this really right? Could renting maybe sometimes be better, really?

DAVIDSON: Of course, Jacob learned, as I think we all did when the housing market finally collapsed, that renting is indeed sometimes better. And sometimes a subprime loan is not the best choice for everybody. So Jacob is sorry in general that he didn't realize earlier that homeownership sometimes - no, not all the time, but sometimes - is not such a great idea.

JOFFE-WALT: And when he thinks back on it now, there were consequences to him coming to that realization so late. There was something very specific he could have done - he wishes he had done differently.

KOSOFF: So on the Freddie Mac website...

DAVIDSON: Freddiemac.com, OK.

KOSOFF: ...If you go down to the bottom of the page, there should be something called calculators, maybe on the bottom right.

DAVIDSON: Calculator. Yeah.

KOSOFF: OK. Click on that.

DAVIDSON: OK.

KOSOFF: And the first option - the first calculator should say rent or buy or something.

DAVIDSON: Rent versus buy.

KOSOFF: OK, perfect. Click on that.

DAVIDSON: OK.

JOFFE-WALT: We're sitting at computers, and the online calculator Jacob takes us to is not something he made, but it's something he managed while he was at Freddie Mac. And at the top, there's a question in bright orange letters - am I better off renting?

DAVIDSON: And to answer that question, you plug in these numbers. What are you paying in rent? How much do you think rent is going to go up? And then there's questions about buying a home. How much do homes cost in your neighborhood? What are property taxes? And then there's this box - how much do you think home prices are going to go up every year? You know, what is the home price appreciation rate?

KOSOFF: So where it says - maybe it's the fourth line, fifth line or sixth line, it'll say appreciation rate. Try to type in -1% there.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

DAVIDSON: OK. Negative one.

KOSOFF: And then click calculate.

DAVIDSON: Get your results. OK. Please fix following errors. Appreciation rate must be a number between zero and 100.

KOSOFF: So I should have fixed that.

DAVIDSON: (Laughter).

JOFFE-WALT: It doesn't even let you do it.

DAVIDSON: It doesn't let you.

KOSOFF: So I should have had that fixed, I think. I should have worked harder to get that resolved because that's a - yeah, that's not really being a neutral - you know, being neutral and supporting financial clarity and financial responsibility. So...

DAVIDSON: Wait, wait, wait. So I - so this is the calculator that Freddie Mac has to determine whether or not you should buy a house.

KOSOFF: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: And it does not allow for the possibility of home prices going down.

KOSOFF: Yes, sorry. I'm sorry that I didn't, you know, send an email or work a little harder to get that fixed so the calculator would allow for the possibility of reality.

JOFFE-WALT: A possibility that we all know very well as a reality today. And Jacob worries today that some people may have used the calculator to come to a very bad decision to buy an overpriced house with a subprime mortgage when they should have just rented instead.

KOSOFF: You know, it's not better to have owned and lost than to have never owned at all kind of thing. Like, if somebody has a good chance of going into default, if someone has a good chance of, you know, not being able to stay in the house, it's probably better not to have pushed them into the house in the first place. So that's a kind of regret that, you know, if housing - everything turned out fine, I wouldn't be upset now. I wouldn't be apologetic. I - but being that house prices fell, and a lot of people are stuck in housing, and they could have rented across the street for half the price, and they can't move, and they can't move to where their family is and whatnot - that is what I kind of apologize for.

DAVIDSON: Now, I should say, I did talk to a spokesman at Freddie Mac, and he said a few things. So No. 1, he said, Freddie Mac believes nobody should make major life decisions, like whether or not to buy a home, based solely on an online calculator, even a freddiemac.com online calculator. No. 2 - Freddie Mac believes renting is a very good option for lots of Americans, and they put their money where their mouth is by funding rental units as well as home mortgages. No. 3 - a spokesperson said that they are aware that this calculator doesn't allow for reality, doesn't allow for prices to go down in homes and said that Freddie Mac is working to have it fixed. Now, I will say, I spoke with the guy more than two weeks ago, and I just checked a few minutes ago, and it is still not working. You still can't have home prices go down.

JOFFE-WALT: So what if it was working? We wanted to know, you know, what would a proper calculator look like? You know, this is a decision people make all the time, whether or not to buy or rent. So we wanted to spend some time just thinking about what an ideal calculation would look like. And we called up Chris Mayer. He's a major authority on this. He teaches real estate finance at Columbia University. And we started by just telling him how Freddie Mac's calculator is broken and doesn't allow you to plug in negative numbers in the home appreciation box.

CHRIS MAYER: (Laughter) OK.

DAVIDSON: Why are you laughing?

MAYER: Oh, because I can believe that.

DAVIDSON: So what do you mean you can believe that?

MAYER: You know, their goal was to kind of get people to buy houses. And everybody made money as long as, you know, homeowners were willing to buy a house. So that - the idea that it is better to buy in any circumstance to rent, I think is, you know - I don't want to say it's a ludicrous idea. But...

DAVIDSON: Say what you were going to say. I feel like you...

MAYER: It was what I was going to say. It still is what I'm going to say.

DAVIDSON: I've always wondered about this puzzle about buying and renting. Economics teaches us that when there are two similar and substitutable goods like, I don't know, apples and oranges, that the price should be pretty close to each other. So let's say oranges are suddenly $3 each, and apples are only $1. Then people are going to start buying more apples and fewer oranges. Apple prices will go up, orange prices will go down and they'll eventually be reasonably close together.

JOFFE-WALT: But that is definitely not the case with renting and buying. Like, in Brooklyn, N.Y., where I live and where you live, Adam, and in a lot of coastal cities, renting is a lot more affordable than buying. The two prices do not come together, and it's been like that for years.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. I did the math for myself a couple years ago. I checked it out. And I rent an apartment, and I saw that if I bought a, you know, roughly similar apartment in my neighborhood, my mortgage would be well more than double what I pay in rent. So that made me think it would be insane for me to buy.

JOFFE-WALT: But when you look in rural areas or in the Midwest, it's often the opposite. Buying is way cheaper than renting.

DAVIDSON: Chris Mayer says that housing is just different from other kinds of financial transactions. It's just weirder. It's more personal.

MAYER: If you tell me that you think that IBM is going to earn, you know, $2 a share in earnings, and it's going to grow at 10% a year - I'm just making up numbers; I don't know what IBM's shares sell for - there would be pretty widespread agreement at about what IBM should be worth. That's not true for housing. It's not true, in particular, because your circumstances and mine are going to be different. We're going to have different time horizons, we're going to have different financial circumstances, and we're going to have different willingness to take risk. And so there isn't a single person that you can sort of say, well, if this prototypical person were to buy, then that figures out what the price of a home is. So as everybody knows, when you put a house on the market, you're really looking for a particular person who really likes your home. And so on one day, your house is worth one thing; on another day, it's worth something different, depending on who's looking at it.

DAVIDSON: Right. And you don't buy an IBM stock because you want to live in it, or you want your kids - I mean, you just buy it to make money.

MAYER: That's exactly right.

DAVIDSON: Whereas some people buy houses just to make money, speculators, but other people might buy it for nonfinancial reasons at all. It's in the neighborhood they grew up in, or, you know, they just really, really love, you know, Victorians or whatever it is.

MAYER: The value of a home is exactly as you said. It's the value you get for living in it. And two different people are going to get two different values from the same home, and so it's a very individual decision.

JOFFE-WALT: So how do you plug that into a calculator?

MAYER: Well, that's part of the problem. This is why I sort of think there isn't a single calculator that you can do that can spit out buy or rent.

JOFFE-WALT: So this guy is a big-shot finance professor. I sort of thought we'd call him, and he'd tell us, OK, here's the numbers you need to think about. And there are spreadsheets, and there's formulas. By the end, he sort of said, no. It's all about your psyche.

DAVIDSON: For now, the Freddie Mac calculator still lives on the Freddie Mac website, still not allowing for the possibility of home declines, the possibility of reality.

JOFFE-WALT: Jacob Kosoff no longer works for Freddie Mac. He's moved to Pittsburgh and taken a new finance job, a job, he says - thank you again - he was able to get thanks to the bailout. And I asked him, when he got to Pittsburgh, if he bought a house, and he wrote me an email back which says - Adam, why don't you just read this? Read what he wrote here.

DAVIDSON: (Reading) My wife and I are proud renters by choice. My experience at Freddie Mac really pushed me away from wanting a mortgage. It's like after working at a slaughterhouse, you just want to be a vegetarian for a while.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LION'S TEETH")

THE MOUNTAIN GOATS: (Singing) I am going to regret the day that I was born.

JOFFE-WALT: While we were working on this podcast, we asked to hear from some of you listening who are facing this question - should I rent or should I buy? And we got a lot of great responses. And we actually had Chris Mayer, the real estate finance professor, talk to some of you.

DAVIDSON: Sadly, we did not have time to fit these conversations in the podcast today. Some are pretty great. Here's a snippet that shows how discussing whether to rent or buy leaves the realm of numbers very quickly and heads down some surprising paths.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: We've been doing a lot of thinking about renting and buying. I'm in my early 50s. My wife and I are looking at retiring in about five or six years or so and started thinking about what if we - when we sold our house and moved to our new town, what if we just didn't buy for a while? And being in a position where we nearly have what we think is enough, then there's no point in taking a lot of risk. You know, there's no point in striving for a lot of money that you're just going to hand off to your kids, you know?

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: Wait. I want my parents to do that.

MAYER: My dad might be listening, but I still agree with you.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I told my wife - she used to ask, what's the retirement plan? I said, well, you know, I think at the end, we'll probably be living in one of our son's basements, and he can come by once a day and throw us a cheeseburger. And she says, oh, that's horrible. And I said - and then she thought about a minute. She says, wait a minute. That means we spent all the money, right? I said, exactly.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LION'S TEETH")

THE MOUNTAIN GOATS: (Singing) They blowtorch the doors. I start wailing.

JOFFE-WALT: We've posted these conversations on our blog. If you want to hear them, they are at npr.org/money.

DAVIDSON: We'd really love to hear from other finance people who maybe, just maybe, want to apologize or thank the U.S. taxpayer. Please, prove me wrong again. Send an email to planetmoney@npr.org, or you can all reach us at Facebook, Twitter, on the blog, npr.org/money. I'm Adam Davidson.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Thanks for listening

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LION'S TEETH.")

THE MOUNTAIN GOATS: (Singing) We hold on. We hold on.

Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Fana Jaffee-Walt.
And I'm Adam Davidson.
Today is Friday, November 5th, and it was, of course, President Obama, you heard at the

Today on the podcast, we bring you something we have been searching for desperately tirelessly
for two years, an apology.
We bring you a person who works in finance, who actually would like to apologize to each

And there's one more thing you'd like to say to all of us.
Thank you.
Thank you for the bailout.

So just a reminder, college grads, the unemployment rate just under 5%.
High school dropouts, the unemployment rate is over 15%.
Wow, it's like high school dropouts and college graduates are living in two totally

College graduates are barely in an economic slowdown at all.
More than 95% have jobs.
And high school dropouts, I mean, that's verging on Great Depression unemployment
rates.
Yeah, it's really striking, although it's worth noting that even in good times for
this country, the unemployment rate is way higher for high school dropouts than for
college grads.
In effect, if you look over the past few years, the unemployment rate has basically
doubled for both of these groups.
You can see this trend and a bunch of other interesting job trends on our blog.
Our production assistant, Jess Zhang, put up some great graphs.
The blog is npr.org slash money, of course.
Nice. Thank you, Jacob.
Thanks, Jacob. Great plug for the blog.
Thanks, guys.
Tuchana, today's podcast is all the result of this pretty remarkable email
that I got a few weeks ago.
It was in response to a piece I did on This American Life with Ira a few weeks
back.
Basically, there's this question we have here at Planet Money.
Why aren't people on Wall Street at least a little bit grateful?
You know, it's pretty clear that in the fall of 2008, most major firms on
Wall Street would have collapsed if us taxpayers didn't bail them out.
I think it's a fairly uncontroversial thing to say.
Yet when we interview people who work on Wall Street, people who work in these
financial firms, their attitude is, I mean, I'd say almost never one of gratitude
to us taxpayers, to the government.
And as an illustration of this on the show, This American Life, you and a
producer from the show went to this bar in the heart of the financial
district, a place called Pound and Pence, to talk to people there.
And I do want to say quickly that at this point in the tape, we had been
arguing for quite some time trying to see if they had any gratitude at all to the
U.S. government and U.S. taxpayers.
OK, so let's hear an excerpt.
So you're an institutional investor.
You work for a credit rating agency.
What do you do?
I work in a bank on Wall Street.
All right.
I can guarantee your bank would have gone under.
Your stock valuation would have collapsed.
Your credit rating agencies would have been out of business.
All three of you directly benefited from the bailout.
What?
You're crazy.
You're crazy.
I'm not crazy.
You're crazy, man.
So what do you do?
Don't bail it out?
That's the question.
Do you not bail it out?
I don't know.
OK, so you let it tank.
What's up to you?
I would like to bail it out and I would like to walk into a bar in lower
Manhattan and have one of you thank me.
Thank you.
I still have my job and I appreciate it.
Why do you want that?
You guys still have your jobs.
Because I'm a smart person.
You think you got to keep your job because you're smart?
You got to keep your job because you guys got bailed out.
You guys got bailed out.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's not why I have my job.
I mean, survival of the fittest.
I'd say these guys are fairly typical of my experience of talking to people who
work in finance, who work on Wall Street.
Instead of an apology, instead of a thank you, we get the opposite.
They say, oh, the government's beating up on us.
The taxpayers are yelling at us.
It's all this populist rage.
And when I aired the story, I, you know, I felt like everyone who works in
finance felt this way.
But then I got this email and actually kind of a testy email from one listener.
Well, I guess I was a little annoyed that you didn't mention some people
were, you know, grateful and apologetic.
Some people specifically like him, Jacob Kossoff.
Jacob is indeed a finance guy, although he didn't work on Wall Street.
He worked in D.C. as an economist for Freddie Mac.
And he told me that my story was wrong, that there are finance people, or at
least he had the evidence of one finance person who would like to say
thank you and I'm sorry.
And so I promised to give him the opportunity right here and now to thank
each and every one of you listening, at least each and every one of you
who is a U.S.
taxpayer. He wants you to know he really is grateful.
I am. Thank you for the for a variety of things.
Thanks for the government money for for Freddie Mac, which I think kept me
employed for a while after that until I voluntarily left.
So thank you for the funding for Freddie and Fannie.
Thank you for the general bailout, which I think helped all financial
firms or if not all, then most financial firms.
And as somebody who works in that industry and applies for jobs at
different ones, you know, a lot of the places I applied to may not have
existed if it wasn't for the government stepping in.
So that right there is Jacob's thank you.
And Adam, you and I talked to Jacob for a while.
And in addition to expressing his gratitude, he also asked for the
opportunity to say he is sorry.
And it's a very specific apology.
And he realized talking to him, it's a really big deal for him to be able
to do this, for him to be able to say I'm sorry.
And that in order to get to this point, he had to go through an entire
personal transformation that challenged his most fundamental beliefs.
Yes. So let's tell the story of his conversion.
It all starts in 2007.
Jacob was working as a home ownership evangelical missionary.
I don't mean that in the religious sense, although actually, I guess I
do kind of mean it in the religious sense.
When you hear him talk about what home ownership meant to him, it
was like he was in the religion of home ownership.
Although professionally, what he was doing was he was an
economist at Freddie Mac.
Now, Freddie Mac is one of these weird institutions.
It's hard to get your head around it.
It was started by the US government to promote home ownership, but at least
until it was taken over by the US government two years ago, when it was
on the verge of collapse, it was in the private sector, it was a for
profit company that was supposed to serve a public service mission.
And Jacob actually worked in something called the mission department.
So our job is to make sure we achieve the goals of Freddie Mac,
which is there's affordability, stability and liquidity.
And specifically in affordability, the government had set affordable
housing goals for us, like a certain percentages of the mortgages that
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae bought had to fit certain low income requirements.
So here's how Jacob made sure Freddie Mac achieved the
goal of broad home ownership.
Every month, traders at Freddie Mac would buy up mortgages from
financial companies all over the US.
And this was great for financial companies because they don't want to
hold on to all those mortgages.
And it was great for Freddie Mac because all that buying meant that they
could exert pressure on the country's lenders.
So Jacob would look over the details and make sure that enough of these
mortgages went to underserved people, poor people, people in bad
neighborhoods. And if not, Jacob was able to get Freddie Mac to call
those big banks and the mortgage lenders and say, Hey guys, you have
to start lending money to more poor people if you want our business.
Jacob and his colleagues called themselves housers, meaning they
believed buying a house is almost always the right solution for everybody.
I would think I was putting people in housing that wouldn't be in
housing and that I thought that subprime mortgages were great and
that they were helping people that were low income that normally
couldn't afford to buy a house, buy a house.
And I was very supportive and I thought subprime was the best
thing in the world.
So you guys were the missionizers.
Yes, we were very into it, very much we were the true believers.
So what's amazing about that is that Jacob was promoting subprime
mortgages after lots of other people in finance were saying, Hey,
there's a subprime housing bubble and it's popping.
When did you start working there?
January 2007.
That's a crazy time to start working there.
Yeah, exactly.
So I mean, we feel we've established that at least some
folks on Wall Street were pretty clear that the bubble was close to
popping. But was that not what you knew?
Yeah, I missed that memo.
Yeah, I did not think house prices were popping.
I was ready to go.
I was like, we need to buy more.
Even in the summer of 2007, I was very supportive.
It wasn't until the fall of 2007 that Jacob Kossoff started to
have some uncomfortable thoughts.
He remembers one weekend he went to a conference and there were a
lot of housers there, lots of people he knew.
And that is when it first happened.
I don't know if there's a specific speaker or a specific paper I read, but
that's the first time I saw it.
Even thinking that you could compare house prices to rents.
Like I remember that clicked in my head.
I was like, Oh, someone could pay 2000 a month in a mortgage.
Maybe the rent would be a thousand.
Maybe that'd be a better deal if they're the same place.
And that was the first time I thought maybe there could be some
times ever in your life possibly that renting could maybe be better.
So remarkably, this thought had never occurred to him before.
But once it entered his brain, it wouldn't leave him alone.
The uncomfortable thoughts kept coming.
I remember then I started trying to do some of the math myself.
I was like, Oh, well, maybe the benefit of house price appreciation
on average really isn't so good because except for the boom years
that cancels out with all the maintenance costs you put in.
And then I stepped back and thought, you know what?
A mortgage is really just 80% interest and interest like rent is
the right to live somewhere you don't own.
And I was like, wow, the rents are lower than the mortgage for all these places.
It was a bit like announcing like, Oh, there is no God.
Like the idea that housing was like God.
It was like, of course it goes up.
Of course it's a great deal.
Well, everyone else said, no, no, no.
We need to favor home ownership, favor home ownership.
Buying is always better.
So I felt very much like an outsider, like an outsider to my
friends, but also outsider to myself.
Like, is this really right?
Is it could renting maybe sometimes be better?
Really?
Of course, Jacob learned, as I think we all did when the housing
market finally collapsed, that renting is indeed sometimes better.
And sometimes the subprime loan is not the best choice for everybody.
So Jacob is sorry in general that he didn't realize earlier that home
ownership sometimes now not all the time, but sometimes is not such a great idea.
And when he thinks back on it now, there were consequences to him coming
to that realization so late, there was something very specific he could have done.
He wishes he had done differently.
So on the Freddie Mac website, freddy mac.com, okay.
If you go down to the bottom of the page, there should be something
called calculators, maybe on the bottom, right calculator.
Yeah.
Okay.
Click on that.
Okay.
And the first option, the first calculator should say rent or buy or
rent versus buy.
Okay.
Perfect.
Click on that.
Okay.
We're sitting at computers and the online calculator, Jacob takes us to, it's
not something he made, but it's something he managed while he was
at Freddie Mac and at the top, there's a question in bright orange letters.
Am I better off renting?
And to answer that question, you plug in these numbers.
What are you paying in rent?
How much do you think rent is going to go up?
And then there's questions about buying a home.
How much do homes cost in your neighborhood?
What are property taxes?
And then there's this box.
How much do you think home prices are going to go up every year?
You know, what is the home price appreciation rate?
So where it says, maybe it's the fourth line, fifth line or sixth line, it'll
say appreciation rate, try to type in negative 1% there, negative one, and
then click calculate your results.
Please fix following errors.
Appreciation rate must be a number between zero and 100.
So I should have fixed it.
So I should have had that fixed.
I think I should have worked harder to get that resolved because that's
yeah, that's, that's not really being a neutral, you know, being neutral and
supporting financial clarity and financial responsibility.
So wait, wait, wait.
So I, so this is, this is the calculator that Freddie Mac has to
determine whether or not you should buy a house and it does not allow
for the possibility of home prices going down.
Yes.
Sorry.
I'm sorry that I didn't, you know, send an email or work a
little harder to get that fixed.
So the calculator would allow for the possibility of reality.
A possibility that we all know very well as a reality today.
Jacob worries today that some people may have used the calculator to come
to a very bad decision to buy an overpriced house with a subprime
mortgage when they should have just rented instead.
You know, it's not better to have owned and lost than to have
never owned at all kind of thing.
Like if somebody has a good chance of going into default, if someone
has a good chance of, you know, not being able to stay in the house,
it's probably better not to have pushed them into the house in the first place.
So that's, I kind of, kind of regret that, you know, if housing,
everything turned out fine.
I wouldn't be upset now.
I wouldn't be apologetic, but being that house prices fell and a lot of
people are stuck in housing and they could have rented across the street
for half the price and they can't move and they can't move to where
their family is and whatnot.
That's what I kind of apologize for.
Now, I should say, I did talk to a spokesman at Freddie Mac and he
said a few things.
So number one, he said, Freddie Mac believes nobody should make major
life decisions like whether or not to buy a home based solely on an online
calculator, even a freddymac.com online calculator.
Number two, Freddie Mac believes renting is a very good option for
lots of Americans and they put their money where their mouth is by
funding rental units, as well as home mortgages.
Number three, the spokesperson said that they are aware that this
calculator doesn't allow for reality, doesn't allow for prices to go
down in homes and said that Freddie Mac is working to have it fixed.
Now, I will say I spoke with the guy more than two weeks ago and I
just checked a few minutes ago and it is still not working.
You still can't have home prices go down.
So what if it was working?
We wanted to know, you know, what would a proper calculator look like?
You know, this is a decision people make all the time, whether or not
to buy or rent.
So we wanted to spend some time just thinking about what an ideal
calculation would look like.
And we called up Chris Mayer.
He's a major authority on this.
He teaches real estate finance at Columbia University.
And we started by just telling him how Freddie Mac's calculator is
broken and doesn't allow you to plug in negative numbers in the
home appreciation box.
Okay.
Why are you laughing?
Oh, because I can believe that.
So what do you mean you can believe that?
You know, their goal was to kind of get people to buy houses and
everybody made money as long as, you know, homeowners were willing
to buy a house so that the idea that it is better to buy in
any circumstance to rent, I think is, you know, I don't want to
say it's a ludicrous idea, but say what you were going to say.
I feel like you sensed it.
It was what I was going to say.
It still is what I'm going to say.
I've always wondered about this puzzle about buying and renting.
Economics teaches us that when there are two similar and
substitutable goods, like, I don't know, apples and oranges,
that the price should be pretty close to each other.
So let's say oranges are suddenly $3 each and apples are
only $1, then people are going to start buying more apples
and fewer oranges.
Apple prices will go up, orange prices will go down and
they'll eventually be reasonably close together.
But that is definitely not the case with renting and buying.
Like in Brooklyn, New York, where I live and where you live
at them, and in a lot of coastal cities, renting is a lot
more affordable than buying.
The two prices do not come together.
And it's been like that for years.
Yeah, I did the math for myself a couple of years ago.
I checked it out and I rent an apartment and I saw that if
I bought a, you know, roughly similar apartment in my
neighborhood, my mortgage would be well more than double
what I pay in rent.
So that made me think it would be insane for me to buy.
But when you look in rural areas or in the Midwest, it's
often the opposite.
Buying is way cheaper than renting.
Chris Mayer says that housing is just different from other
kinds of financial transactions.
It's just weirder.
It's more personal.
If you tell me that you think that IBM is going to
earn, you know, $2 a share in earnings and it's going to
grow at 10% a year, I'm just making up numbers.
I don't know what IBM's share to solve for.
There will be pretty widespread agreement at about
what IBM should be worth.
That's not true for housing.
It's not true in particular because your circumstances in
mine are going to be different.
We're going to have different time horizons.
We're going to have different financial circumstances and we're
going to have different willingness to take risk.
And so there isn't a single person that you can sort of say,
well, if this prototypical person were to buy, then that
figures out what the price of a home is.
So as everybody knows, when you put a house on the
market, you're really looking for a particular person who
really likes your home.
And so on one day, your house is worth one thing.
On another day, it's worth something different, depending
on who's looking at it.
Right.
And you don't buy an IBM stock because you want to live
in it or you want your kids to go to school.
I mean, you just buy it to make money.
That's exactly right.
Whereas some people buy houses just to make money,
speculators, but other people might buy it for non-financial
reasons at all.
It's in the neighborhood they grew up in or, you know,
they just really, really love, you know, Victorians or
whatever it is.
The value of a home is exactly as you said, it's the
value you get for living in it.
And two different people are going to get two different
values from the same home.
And so it's a very individual position.
So how do you plug that into a calculator?
Well, that's, that's part of the problem.
This is why I sort of think there isn't a single
calculator that you can do that can spit out buy or rent.
So this guy's a big shot finance professor.
I sort of thought we'd call him and he'd tell us,
okay, here's the numbers you need to think about.
And there's spreadsheets and there's formulas.
But in the end, he sort of said, no, it's all about
your psyche.
For now, the Freddie Mac calculator still lives on the
Freddie Mac website, still not allowing for the
possibility of home declines, the possibility of reality.
Jacob Kossoff no longer works for Freddie Mac.
He's moved to Pittsburgh and taken a new finance job,
a job he says, thank you again.
He was able to get thanks to the bailout.
And I asked him when he got to Pittsburgh, if
he bought a house, and he wrote me an email back,
which says, Adam, why don't you just read
this, read what he wrote here.
My wife and I are proud renters by choice.
My experience at Freddie Mac really pushed me
away from wanting a mortgage.
It's like after working at a slaughterhouse, you
just want to be a vegetarian for a while.
While we were working on this podcast, we asked
to hear from some of you listening who are
facing this question, should I rent or should I
buy? And we got a lot of great responses and
we actually had Chris Mayer, the real estate
finance professor, talk to some of you.
Sadly, we did not have time to fit these
conversations in the podcast today.
Some are pretty great.
Here's a snippet that shows how discussing
whether to rent or buy leaves the realm of
numbers very quickly and heads down some
surprising paths.
We've been doing a lot of thinking about
renting and buying. I'm in my early 50s.
My wife and I are looking at retiring in
about five or six years or so and started
thinking about, what if we, when we sold
our house and moved to our new town, what
if we just didn't buy for a while?
And being in a position where we nearly
have what we think is enough, then
there's no point in taking a lot of risk.
You know, there's no point in striving for
a lot of money that you're just going to
hand off to your kids, you know?
Wait, I want my parents to do that.
My dad might be listening, but I still
agree with you.
She used to ask, what's the retirement
plan? I said, well, you know, I think at
the end we'll probably be living in one
of our son's basements and he can come
by once a day and throw us a cheeseburger.
And she says, oh, that's horrible.
And I said, and then she thought about it
and then she says, wait a minute, that
means we've spent all the money, right?
That's it. Exactly.
We've posted these conversations on our
blog. If you want to hear them, they're
at npr.org slash money.
We'd really love to hear from other
finance people who maybe just maybe
want to apologize or thank the U.S.
taxpayer. Please prove me wrong again.
Send an email to planetmoney at
npr.org or you can all reach
us at Facebook, Twitter, on the blog
npr.org slash money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Plano Jaffee-Walt.
Thanks for listening.
