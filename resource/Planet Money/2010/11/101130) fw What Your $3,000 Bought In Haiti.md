Earlier this year, we reported on l'Artibonite, a rice-growing region in Haiti. The people there were suffering because an influx of free rice from foreign aid groups destroyed the market for their crop. Listeners responded, donating some $3,000 to support a school that figured prominently in the story. That's about 10 years of wages for the average Haitian. The principal, Enselm Simpliste, thought he could use the $3,000 to build a schoolhouse. We recently visited the school to see how things were coming along. The news is bad: All the money has been spent, and all there is to show for it is a foundation, some concrete blocks and some rock and sand.

Earlier this year, we reported on l'Artibonite, a rice-growing region in Haiti. The people there were suffering because an influx of free rice from foreign aid groups destroyed the market for their crop.

Listeners responded, donating some $3,000 to support a school that figured prominently in the story. That's about 10 years of wages for the average Haitian.

The school doesn't have a building; classes are held in a small, one-room church, where blackboards are leaned up against the wall. The principal, Enselm Simpliste, thought he could use the $3,000 to build a schoolhouse.

We recently visited the school to see how things were coming along. The news is bad: All the money has been spent, and all there is to show for it is what's in the photo above — a foundation, some concrete blocks and some rock and sand.

Simpliste was in charge of the project. He says he bought the materials himself, and got bad information from a contractor, who told him the project would be done by October. As he told us through a translator:

    I feel really, really ashamed. Every morning I wake up and I see the foundation and I see those concrete blocks. And people around are like making fun of me, because they were aware that a project started, a school was supposed to start and finalized by October.

The problems with the school project get at some of the broader issues we've been looking at all year in Haiti. Is it better for rich-world donors to work with NGOs, or to give money directly to poor people in developing countries?

Our story about Yvrose Jean Baptiste, whose small business was destroyed by the earthquake, also prompted listeners to donate thousands of dollars. And in her case, there was an entirely different outcome: the money transformed her life.

MARANA ANARAB: Bonjour. (Speaking French), PLANET MONEY.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

CAITLIN KENNEY, HOST:

And I'm Caitlin Kenney. Today is Tuesday, November 30. That was Marana Anarab (ph), who prefers to be called Madame Claude, you heard at the top. On the show today, we're going to take you to a school in Haiti to follow up on money that you, our PLANET MONEY listeners, donated - thousands of dollars to one school. But first, of course, we have Jacob Goldstein with the PLANET MONEY indicator.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator is 5.5%. That's about how much interest Spain has to pay to borrow money for 10 years. Now, by comparison, Germany is paying less than 3% to borrow money for 10 years. So you can think of Spain like a guy with bad credit. You know, people will lend him money, but they say, we're going to charge you a lot of interest to do that.

DAVIDSON: Now, it is no surprise at all that Spain would have to pay more, that the world of investors would charge Spain more to lend them money. I mean, that's been the case for - since before there was a Germany. I mean, Spain, like - what was it? - the 16th century when they were an economic powerhouse bigger than the German nations. But what is troubling is that the amount Spain has to pay to borrow - in other words, the measure of how much people are freaked out about Spain - has increased in the last week. Last weekend, the European Union announced its big bailout of Ireland, and the whole goal was actually, in part, to help people feel calmer about Spain. The idea was, hey, we're going to stop this contagion. Don't worry so much. The euro is going to survive. The euro is going to be strong. So the fact that investors around the world are more worried about Spain this week is really troubling.

GOLDSTEIN: It is. And Spain is an especially big deal. You know, Greece went earlier this year, and there was a bailout for Greece. And everybody kind of knew the Ireland bailout was coming - Portugal maybe going to need a bailout too. But all of those countries - you take Greece, Ireland and Portugal - take them all and double them. That's about how big Spain is, right? So Europe can bail out Greece. Europe can bail out Ireland. Europe can bail out Portugal. But if Spain needs a bailout, that is a big deal that is going to cause massive economic trouble in Europe.

DAVIDSON: And here - I mean, that - we in the U.S. are really not going to feel the pain of a bankrupt Greece or Ireland or a bailed-out Greece or Ireland. But if Spain goes and the entire eurozone is thrown into that level of turmoil, our companies aren't going to be able to sell stuff to Europe. The European financial institutions are not going to be able to do the same level of investment with American companies. I mean, that's going to really hurt the whole world.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And as we found out a couple years ago, the whole financial system is so interconnected that who knows what'll happen here, essentially, if Spain goes down. So I should add here that our own Chana Joffe-Walt, today, was making calls to Spain, and we hope she will be on a plane to Spain in the next few weeks to figure out for us what's really going on there.

DAVIDSON: And we'll certainly be bringing you much about Spain and Europe and the U.S. and the economic crisis that never seems to end. Thank you, Jacob.

KENNEY: Thanks, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

DAVIDSON: All right. So on today's podcast, we're going to do this follow-up with the school you and I visited. But in doing that, I think we're going to be able to tackle this big question that we at PLANET MONEY have thought a lot about this year, which is, what is the best way for people in wealthy countries help people in really, really poor countries? The main way that happens now is government-to-government, so the U.S. government gives the Haitian government money, and the Haitian government uses it this way or that, or individuals will give money to big NGOs like Oxfam or whatever, UNICEF, and they will then divvy up the money. But there is an argument that economists make and some activists make that the most efficient thing, the best thing is just give the money directly to the poor people. Let them decide how to spend it. Don't use this massive NGO infrastructure between the donors and the recipients.

KENNEY: We've been doing a lot of reporting from Haiti over the last few months, and one of the stories we did created a natural experiment to test this question - what happens when you give the money to the people directly? A few months ago, we profiled a school in Latibonit, Haiti. And after that story aired, you listeners wanted to donate money. Let's hear a little from that first story.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

UNIDENTIFIED TEACHER: (Non-English language spoken).

KENNEY: While we're in the classroom, I noticed that the teacher spends a lot of time writing full paragraphs on the chalkboard. It was nearly full. And later he tells us that's because he wants the kids who can't afford the books to be able to write down the lesson.

DAVIDSON: The school certainly can't afford to give the kids textbooks or even notebooks. They can't afford to pay the teachers every month. The principal, Enselm Simpliste (ph), tells us that the teachers stick around because they all went to school here and want to help.

KENNEY: Here's what else the school can't afford - a school building. Classes are taking place in a small, one-room church. There's blackboards precariously leaning against the walls. Kids are sitting in pews, and they're trying to awkwardly take notes in their laps.

(CROSSTALK)

KENNEY: Outside, in back, the little kids are under a tarp. And everywhere you go, it's so hot that it's hard to breathe.

DAVIDSON: Principal Simplice takes out the school's financial records, all written by hand on a few sheets of loose-leaf paper. It shows how much each family owes the school. Tuition is 350 Haitian dollars. That's around 45 bucks U.S. Each sheet of paper has a list of all the kids from a grade. Next to each kid's name is a number - how much his or her parents owe the school.

So this is, like, sixth grade - Charles (ph) - 350, Fenard (ph) - 150, Jerome (ph) - 250, Toros (ph) - 50. So in the entire sixth grade, one kid paid most of his account, and the majority paid nothing.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). Yes, yes - exactly.

DAVIDSON: So that story aired on Morning Edition, and we started getting all these emails. This had actually happened to us a few months earlier with another story we did about someone in Haiti. And, you know, we're reporters. Our job is to report. We personally and NPR, we don't set up NGOs. We don't directly contribute money to the people we report on. But something we felt comfortable doing was advising the principal of the school, Enselm Simpliste, that he should set up a bank account that could accept international donations, and we let listeners know how they could send money.

KENNEY: The money started coming in, and the principal had told us that if he could just get $800, that would change everything. He thought with $800 he could buy new textbooks and desks. And he even had this dream of building a small addition onto the classroom to put a roof over where the little kids are sitting in the back. He thought $800 would let him do so much for the school.

DAVIDSON: And actually, you listeners donated not $800 but over $3,000, which was sort of an amazing amount. And, you know, I'll be honest, it's - you know, again, it's an awkward position. We're not supposed to help people, but you and I were really thrilled, Caitlin. I mean, we were really moved by the principal and the kids and this whole school. And it felt just wonderful to think that our reporting could lead to a real transformation of life for the school and its students. And also we're intellectually curious and thought this is a great way to test this question. You know, what happens when you give $3,000 directly to a school that needs it?

KENNEY: Exactly. So a couple months after the money was donated, I actually went back to Haiti to see what had changed.

(SOUNDBITE OF CAR KEYS)

KENNEY: (Non-English language spoken).

ENSELM SIMPLISTE: (Non-English language spoken).

KENNEY: Principal Simpliste told me through a translator that he was amazed when he went to the bank to get the money, and he started to realize that he could do more than he had dreamed of. He could do more than buy notebooks and desks. He could build a brand-new school. The kids are currently taking classes in a church. This would be the first time they had their own school building. And so he told the parents and the kids, that's what we're going to do. We're going to build a brand-new school.

SIMPLISTE: (Through interpreter) The way the children reacts here, it's like, after school, when you're walking by with the other comrades from other schools, they're talking like, yeah, I'm going to have a new school, man. I'm going to have a new school. It's going to build by - we got the fund from American people. So American people are behind us, and they're helping us to build our new school. So come on, man, we're going to be fresh also.

KENNEY: Work on the new building began in September, and Principal Simpliste told the students it would be completed one month later in October. But that hasn't happened.

So we're standing across the street in this foundation. There's a bunch of concrete blocks in the middle. So tell me how this is going to be set up.

SIMPLISTE: (Through interpreter) This big classroom - with this big classroom, we're going to have the fifth and sixth grade here.

KENNEY: Four months after the money came in, Adam, it's all been spent - all $3,000. And all the school has to show for it is a foundation and a stack of concrete blocks. There's a hole in the back of this foundation where the principal hoped to put bathrooms, and it's starting to fill up with trash. And there are no walls, so goats and chickens are just roaming around everywhere. You weren't able to come with me on this trip, but I brought a picture in here in studio with me to show you of what it looks like now.

DAVIDSON: Oh, God, it's so sad 'cause it - you can see it's a big foundation for what would be a really nice school. There's a pile of cinderblock, and I can see the potential, but I can also see there is no school there. This is completely useless. This is like...

KENNEY: Dirt and rocks.

DAVIDSON: ...Dirt and rocks.

KENNEY: And we're going to post some of these pictures on our blog, npr.org/money. And it may not look like much to you, but compared to the way the school is operating right now, this new building would have been a huge step up.

DAVIDSON: All right. So this is it. The foundation and the pile of not enough cinderblocks, that's all they have from the $3,000.

KENNEY: That's all they have. And since visiting the school, I've spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out what happened, how the project could have been so mismanaged. The one thing I know for sure is that this was a much bigger project than Principal Simpliste had ever been in charge of. Three thousand dollars is about what a typical Haitian earns in 10 years. It's many, many times bigger than the school's annual budget.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. When you told me about this, I thought, it's like if someone came up to me or one of our listeners and said, hey, here's $10 million, go build yourself a skyscraper. Like, we have no idea if that's enough money or nowhere near enough money, is - how many bricks do you need? How much glass? How do you build a foundation? It would be a bigger project than we've ever handled, and that's the position he was in.

KENNEY: Exactly. He tried to be responsible. He told me that he bought all the materials himself, but he doesn't have any construction experience, and he was wrong about how much rock and sand he would need. He thought three truckloads of each would be enough, but it wasn't even close. And the contractor he hired wasn't much help either. He just kept saying, oh, yeah, sorry, this is going to be a lot more than we talked about.

DAVIDSON: Right, which sounds like contractors everywhere. They underbid to get the job, and then suddenly, the real cost comes in. Now, we should say when we first started hearing from listeners that they wanted to help, some people we know who do this kind of work said, well, you need to get an NGO to partner with him. You need some outside expert who can help him. And we actually made some phone calls. We called - I can't remember everyone we called. But a lot. We called Oxfam and the U.N. and a few other NGOs. I even called, like, the Baptist church - the national Baptist church 'cause his church is a Baptist church - trying to see if there was any NGOs who could help him with building projects.

But l'Artibonite is a desperately poor area. The cholera is centered there. They have a lot of needs. But all those NGOs you hear about, they're all in Port-au-Prince, in the capital. L'Artibonite is two hours north of where the earthquake struck. And so we couldn't find any NGOs within a hundred miles of him who were in a position to help him, so he really was on his own.

KENNEY: And that means he had the sole responsibility for the project, and now he's the one taking all the blame for it going wrong.

SIMPLISTE: (Through interpreter) I feel ashamed. I feel really, really ashamed. Every morning, I wake up, and I see the foundation. And I see those concrete blocks the way they are. And people around are, like, making fun out of me, you know, because they were aware that a project started. The schools were supposed to start and finalize by October or something. But I feel really, really ashamed. It's like - it's a kind of pressure for me, also.

KENNEY: Principal Simpliste had a friend who's a contractor come look at the building. And he's pretty sure that for another $3,000 he could finish it. But he just doesn't know where that money would come from. As we heard in the first story, the parents can barely pay tuition, so they don't have any extra money to donate to finish the school.

DAVIDSON: So it just looks like there's just not going to be a school. That 3,000 is just gone.

KENNEY: It's hard to imagine right now that they'll be able to finish and move classes into that new building.

DAVIDSON: So the story of the school is a really strong data point in favor of the argument, hey, don't give money directly to poor people. If you want them to do transformative things - sort of by definition, they don't know how to do the transformative things because they haven't yet been transformed. You really need this framework of NGOs, and you need this framework of outside helpers to help them spend that money properly.

Although as we reported - like, Chana and I did all that reporting on the mango processing centers - we learned that those NGOs bring with them a ton of red tape and a ton of bureaucracy that slows things down. And that story we did about Yvrose Jean Baptiste - she was the very poor, incredibly savvy entrepreneur, the one who would borrow money, then ride a bus to the Dominican border, buy a bunch of, like, spaghetti and tomato sauce and stuff, bring it back to Port-au-Prince, sell it for a tiny profit, then make the trip again. Listeners were moved by her story as well. They sent money for her as well - same way, using a microfinance bank, the same Fonkoze bank. And she actually got a little more than the school, a little more than $3,000.

And she is, like, the poster child of the argument, hey, just give the money directly to the poor people. She did it exactly right. She paid off the little debt that she had. She spent money to get her kids in school. And she saved a big chunk 'cause, as she said, a lot of tragedies seem to happen in Haiti. And when you don't have savings - and she had never had savings before - you can't really weather those tragedies. And then, she spent about 1,500 bucks buying a stall in a popular market and really building a much more successful business than the one she had before. It's hard, in the case of Yvrose, to imagine an NGO could have helped her any more than she helped herself.

KENNEY: And we thought the story of the school and Principal Enselm Simpliste would be another great example, another huge success story, that these kids would be much better off than the first time we met them. But they aren't. Nothing has really changed at all. And so if we've proven anything, I guess, in this podcast, it's that sometimes, it works to give people the money directly, and sometimes, it doesn't.

DAVIDSON: Which, by the way, is what the data shows. I mean, I've read a fair bit of reports on this. Economists study this kind of thing - giving money directly or not giving money directly. And it does seem that it can be incredibly beneficial, that many poor people, even some of the poorest, least-educated people in the world, are incredibly savvy about what they need to make their lives better. And they know much better than some foreign NGO who flies in. At the same time, there are projects that are beyond the capacity of local people that, you know - construction projects, water sanitation projects, health and medical projects, that the local community typically does not have that capability. So I am still fascinated by this issue, and I'd love to keep an eye on it. As you know, I'm going to go back to Haiti in January, and I'm hoping to visit the school and see if there's been any progress at all.

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Caitlin Kenney.
Today is Tuesday, November 30th.
That was Marana Anarab, who prefers to be called Madame Claude, you heard at the top.
On the show today, we're going to take you to a school in Haiti to follow up on money
that you, our Planet Money listeners, donated, thousands of dollars to one school.
First, of course, we have Jacob Goldstein with the Planet Money Indicator.
Today's Planet Money Indicator is five and a half percent.
That's about how much interest Spain has to pay to borrow money for ten years.
Now, by comparison, Germany is paying less than three percent to borrow money for
ten years.
So, you can think of Spain like a guy with bad credit, you know, people will
lend them money, but they say, we're going to charge you a lot of interest to
do that.
Now, it is no surprise at all that Spain would have to pay more, that the world
of investors would charge Spain more to lend them money.
I mean, that's been the case for since before there was a Germany.
I mean, Spain, like, what, the 16th century when they were an economic
powerhouse bigger than the German nations.
But what is troubling is that the amount Spain has to pay to borrow, in
other words, the measure of how much people are freaked out about Spain, has
increased in the last week.
Last weekend, the European Union announced this big bailout of Ireland, and
the whole goal was actually in part to help people feel calmer about Spain.
The idea was, hey, we're going to stop this contagion.
Don't worry so much.
The euro is going to survive.
The euro is going to be strong.
So, the fact that investors around the world are more worried about Spain
this week is really troubling.
It is. And Spain is an especially big deal.
You know, Greece went earlier this year and there was a bailout for
Greece and everybody kind of knew the Ireland bailout was coming.
Portugal may be going to need a bailout, too.
But all of those countries, you take Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, take them
all and double them.
That's about how big Spain is, right?
So, Europe can bail out Greece.
Europe can bail out Ireland.
Europe can bail out Portugal.
But if Spain needs a bailout, that is a big deal that is going to cause
massive economic trouble in Europe.
And here, I mean, we in the US are really not going to feel the pain of
a bankrupt Greece or Ireland or a bailed out Greece or Ireland.
But if Spain goes and the entire eurozone is thrown into that level of
turmoil, our companies aren't going to be able to sell stuff to Europe.
The European financial institutions are not going to be able to do the same
level of investment with American companies.
I mean, that's going to really hurt the whole world.
Right. And as we found out a couple of years ago, the whole financial
system is so interconnected that who knows what will happen here,
essentially, if Spain goes down.
So, I should add here that our own Khanna Jaffee-Walt today was making
calls to Spain.
And we hope she will be on a plane to Spain in the next few weeks to figure
out for us what's really going on.
And we'll certainly be bringing you much about Spain and Europe and the
US and the economic crisis that never seems to end.
Thank you, Jacob.
Thanks, Jacob.
Thanks, guys.
All right. So, on today's podcast, we're going to do this follow up with
the school you and I visited.
But in doing that, I think we're going to be able to tackle this big
question that we at Plant Money have thought a lot about this year,
which is what is the best way for people in wealthy countries help people
in really, really poor countries?
The main way that happens now is government to government.
So, the US government gives the Haitian government money and the
Haitian government uses it this way or that.
Or individuals will give money to big NGOs like Oxfam or whatever,
UNICEF, and they will then divvy up the money.
But there is an argument that economists make and some activists make,
that the most efficient thing, the best thing, is just give the money
directly to the poor people.
Let them decide how to spend it.
Don't use this massive NGO infrastructure between the donors and the recipients.
We've been doing a lot of reporting from Haiti over the last few months.
And one of the stories we did created a natural experiment to test this question.
What happens when you give the money to the people directly?
A few months ago, we profiled a school in La Thibaut, Haiti.
And after that story aired, you listeners wanted to donate money.
Let's hear a little from that first story.
While we're in the classroom, I noticed that the teacher spends a lot
of time writing full paragraphs on the chalkboard.
It was nearly full.
And later, he tells us that's because he wants the kids who can't
afford the books to be able to write down the lesson.
The school certainly can't afford to give the kids text books or
even notebooks.
They can't afford to pay the teachers every month.
The principal on some simply tells us that the teachers stick around
because they all went to school here and want to help.
Here's what else the school can't afford.
A school building.
Classes are taking place in a small one room church.
There's blackboards precariously leaning against the walls.
Kids are sitting in pews and
they're trying to awkwardly take notes in their laps.
Outside and back, the little kids are under a tarp.
And everywhere you go, it's so hot that it's hard to breathe.
Principal Simplese takes out the school's financial records,
all written by hand on a few sheets of loose leaf paper.
It shows how much each family owes the school.
Tuition is 350 Haitian dollars.
That's around 45 bucks US.
Each sheet of paper has a list of all the kids from a grade.
Next to each kid's name is a number.
How much his or her parents owe the school.
So this is like sixth grade, Charles 350,
Fennard 150, Jérôme 250, Deroz 50.
So in the entire sixth grade, one kid paid most of his accounts.
And the majority paid nothing.
Yes, yes, exactly.
So that story aired on Morning Edition and
we started getting all these emails.
This had actually happened to us a few months earlier with another story we did
about someone in Haiti.
And we're reporters, our job is to report.
We personally, and PR, we don't set up NGOs.
We don't directly contribute money to the people we report on.
But something we felt comfortable doing was advising the principal of the school
and Sam Simplese that he should set up a bank account that could accept
international donations.
And we let listeners know how they could send money.
The money started coming in and the principal had told us that if he could
just get $800, that would change everything.
He thought with $800, he could buy new textbooks and desks.
And he even had this dream of building a small addition onto the classroom to
put a roof over where the little kids are sitting in the back.
He thought $800 would let him do so much for the school.
And actually, you listeners donated not $800, but over $3,000,
which was sort of an amazing amount.
And I'll be honest, again, it's an awkward position.
We're not supposed to help people.
But you and I were really thrilled, Caitlin.
I mean, we were really moved by the principal and the kids and this whole
school. And it felt just wonderful to think that our reporting could lead to
a real transformation of life for the school and its students.
And also, we're intellectually curious and thought this is a great way to
test this question. You know, what happens when you give $3,000 directly to a
school that needs it?
Exactly. So a couple months after the money was donated, I actually went back
to Haiti to see what had changed.
Principal Simplice told me through a translator that he was amazed when he
went to the bank to get the money.
And he started to realize that he could do more than he had dreamed of.
He could do more than buy notebooks and desks.
He could build a brand new school.
The kids are currently taking classes in a church.
This would be the first time they had their own school building.
And so he told the parents and the kids, that's what we're going to do.
We're going to build a brand new school.
The way the children react here, it's like after school, when they're
working with the other comrades from other schools, they're talking like,
I'm going to have a new school, man. I'm going to have the new school.
It's going to be built by, we got that fund from American people.
So American people are behind us and they're helping us to build
their new school. So come on, man.
We're going to be fresh also.
Work on the new building began in September, and Principal Simplice
told the students it would be completed one month later in October.
But that hasn't happened.
So we're standing across the street in this foundation.
There's a bunch of concrete blocks in the middle.
So tell me how this is going to be set up.
This big classroom, with this big classroom,
we're going to have the fifth and sixth grade here.
Four months after the money came in, Adam, it's all been spent,
all $3,000.
And all the school has to show for it is a foundation and a stack of
concrete blocks.
There's a hole in the back of this foundation where the principal
hoped to put bathrooms, and it's starting to fill up with trash.
And there are no walls.
So goats and chickens are just roaming around everywhere.
You weren't able to come with me on this trip, but I brought a
picture in here in studio with me to show you of what it looks like now.
Oh, God, it's so sad, because you can see it's a big foundation
for what would be a really nice school.
There's a pile of cinder block.
And so I can see the potential, but I can also see there is no
school there.
This is completely useless.
This is like dirt and rocks.
Dirt and rocks.
And we're going to post some of these pictures on our blog,
npr.org slash money.
And it may not look like much to you, but compared to the way the school is
operating right now, this new building would have been a huge step up.
All right, so this is it.
The foundation and the pile of not enough cinder blocks.
That's all they have from the $3,000.
That's all they have.
And since visiting the school, I've spent a fair amount of time trying to
figure out what happened, how the project could have been so mismanaged.
The one thing I know for sure is that this was a much bigger project
than Principal Simplist had ever been in charge of.
$3,000 is about what a typical Haitian earns in 10 years.
It's many, many times bigger than the school's annual budget.
Yeah, when you told me about this, I thought it's like if someone came up
to me or one of our listeners and said, hey, here's $10 million.
Go build yourself a skyscraper.
We have no idea if that's enough money or nowhere near enough money.
How many bricks do you need?
How much glass?
How do you build a foundation?
It would be a bigger project than we've ever handled.
And that's the position he was in.
Exactly.
He tried to be responsible.
He told me that he bought all the materials himself.
But he doesn't have any construction experience.
And he was wrong about how much rock and sand he would need.
He thought three truckloads of each would be enough.
But it wasn't even close.
And the contractor he hired wasn't much help either.
He just kept saying, oh, yeah, sorry.
This is going to be a lot more than we talked about.
Right, which sounds like contractors everywhere.
They underbid to get the job.
And then suddenly the real cost comes in.
Now, we should say when we first started hearing from listeners
that they wanted to help, some people we know who do this kind of work
said, well, you need to get an NGO to partner with him.
You need some outside expert who can help him.
And we actually made some phone calls.
We called, I can't remember everyone we called, but a lot.
We called Oxfam and the UN and a few other NGOs.
I even called the Baptist Church, the National Baptist Church,
because his church is a Baptist Church,
trying to see if there was any NGOs who could help him
with building projects.
But La Tibonite is a desperately poor area.
The cholera is centered there.
They have a lot of needs.
But all those NGOs you hear about,
they're all in Port-au-Prince in the capital.
La Tibonite is two hours north of where the earthquake struck.
And so we couldn't find any NGOs within 100 miles of him
who were in a position to help him.
So he really was on his own.
And that means he had the sole responsibility for the project.
And now, he's the one taking all the blame for it going wrong.
I feel ashamed.
I feel really, really ashamed.
Every morning I wake up and I see the foundation
and I see those concrete blocks the way they are.
And people around are like making fun of me, you know,
because they were aware that a project started.
The schools were supposed to start and finalize
by October or something.
But I feel really, really ashamed.
It's like, it's a kind of pressure for me also.
Principal Simplese had a friend who's a contractor
come look at the building.
And he's pretty sure that for another $3,000,
he could finish it.
But he just doesn't know where that money would come from.
As we heard in the first story,
the parents can barely pay tuition.
So they don't have any extra money
to donate to finish the school.
So it just looks like there's just not going to be a school.
That $3,000 is just gone.
It's hard to imagine right now that they'll be able to finish
and move classes into that new building.
So the story of the school is a really strong data point
in favor of the argument,
hey, don't give money directly to poor people.
If you want them to do transformative things,
sort of by definition,
they don't know how to do the transformative things
because they haven't yet been transformed.
You really need this framework of NGOs
and you need this framework of outside helpers
to help them spend that money properly.
Although, as we reported,
like Hannah and I did all that reporting
on the mango processing centers,
we learned that those NGOs bring with them
a ton of red tape and a ton of bureaucracy
that slows things down.
And that story we did about Yves Rose Jean-Baptiste,
she was the very poor, incredibly savvy entrepreneur,
the one who would borrow money
then ride a bus to the Dominican border,
buy a bunch of like spaghetti
and tomato sauce and stuff,
bring it back to Port-au-Prince,
sell it for a tiny profit,
then make the trip again.
Listeners were moved by her story as well.
They sent money for her as well.
Same way, using a microfinance bank,
the same Funko's day bank.
And she actually got a little more than the school,
a little more than $3,000.
And she is like the poster child of the argument,
hey, just give the money directly to the poor people.
She did it exactly right.
She paid off the little debt that she had.
She spent money to get her kids in school
and she saved a big chunk,
because as she said,
a lot of tragedies seem to happen in Haiti
and when you don't have savings
and she had never had savings before,
you can't really weather those tragedies.
And then she spent about 1,500 bucks
buying a stall in a popular market
and really building a much more successful business
than the one she had before.
It's hard in the case of Yves Rose
to imagine an NGO could have helped her
any more than she helped herself.
And we thought the story of the school
and principal and Samson Police
would be another great example,
another huge success story
that these kids would be much better off
than the first time we met them.
But they aren't.
Nothing has really changed at all.
And so if we've proven anything,
I guess in this podcast,
it's that sometimes it works
to give people the money directly
and sometimes it doesn't.
Which by the way, is what the data shows.
I mean, I've read a fair bit of reports on this,
economists study this kind of thing,
giving money directly or not giving money directly.
And it does seem
that it can be incredibly beneficial
that many poor people,
even some of the poorest least educated people
in the world are incredibly savvy
about what they need to make their lives better.
And they know much better
than some foreign NGO who flies in.
At the same time, there are projects
that are beyond the capacity of local people
that construction projects,
water sanitation projects,
health and medical projects
that the local community typically
does not have that capability.
So I am still fascinated by this issue
and I'd love to keep an eye on it.
As you know, I'm gonna go back to Haiti in January
and I'm hoping to visit the school
and see if there's been any progress at all.
