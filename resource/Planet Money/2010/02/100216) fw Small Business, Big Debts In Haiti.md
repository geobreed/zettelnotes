We meet Yvrose Jean Baptiste, a small-time Haitian wholesaler. Yvrose has a unique business model. She borrows money from a microcredit bank and every two weeks takes a bus to the Dominican Republic border, where she buys a bunch of produce and products to bring back to Port-au-Prince. She then lends out her goods out to various small shop owners and people who sell things on the street. She gives them two weeks to sell everything and then comes back to pick up the money. Yrose says it's been a successful model in the past, but the earthquake has been a big hit to her business. Most of her inventory has been destroyed and now she has to scramble to pay the loan back.

**faster whisper:**
It's understandable why when you're sitting at your kitchen table and your wife or husband
lost their job and you're worried about your job, where you're not sure you can send your
kid back to college this year, where you can't get any help to care for your elderly parent,
there's no wonder you're sitting there and feeling angry.
But there's going to be tangible evidence, tangible evidence of the path we put the
country on, that we're moving in the right direction has become more and more apparent
by the time we get on.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm Alex Bloomberg.
It's Tuesday, February 16th.
That was Vice President Joe Biden, you heard at the top, defending the Obama administration's
strategy for fixing the economy that was on Meet the Press on Sunday.
On our show today, sophisticated entrepreneurship among the poorest people in Haiti.
But first, Alex, we have a Planet Money indicator.
It is $10,000, a huge rise in prices that actually may be good news.
It will cost you $10,000 more each day if you want to rent a standard cargo ship,
the kinds you see in ports all over the world.
The ones that are three times bigger than the Statue of Liberty.
You can rent one, most people don't know that, but by the end of the year it will
cost you $39,000 a day versus $29,000 a day at the end of last year.
That is a 31% increase.
Now for those of us who are not renting massive cargo ships, this is actually probably good
news because it's a sign that global trade is picking up.
Demand for ships is going up, so the price is going up.
And it actually gives me an idea for the Planet Money holiday party.
I'm interested.
Cargo ship, Port of Newark, Newers Eve, 1,000 people, $39 a head.
BYOB, I love it.
It pays for itself.
All right.
Let's move on to the subject of today's podcast, which is more from your and Chana Jaffee-Waltz
trip to Haiti.
Last week you guys were talking about small and medium-sized businesses in Haiti and
how hard it is for those types of businesses to expand.
Today we're going to hear about business, but in a way we don't normally think about
it.
We're talking business at almost a subsistence level, the smallest businesses basically in
the world.
Yeah.
Today we're going to meet an entrepreneur that Chana and I met in Port-au-Prince.
And while the dollar value of her business is incredibly small, I found her to be so
sophisticated, like as sophisticated as a lot of the people we've interviewed who deal
with millions and billions of dollars of business.
And you happened upon her by accident, right?
You were on a tour with the economic advisor to the prime minister.
Yeah.
Chana and I were spending the day with Jean-Palais Maturin.
He's Haiti's prime minister's chief economic advisor.
And he wanted to show us how the economy of Haiti works.
So he took us on a tour of Port-au-Prince, and the first stop was actually his old office
where the prime minister worked up until a few weeks ago.
It's a gorgeous Italian designed villa on a cliff overlooking downtown Port-au-Prince,
although right now it's being used for a very different purpose.
This is a garden.
This is a beautiful patio.
There's a nice swimming pool.
You have trees, you have shade, you have everything.
I can picture lovely parties here with...
Normally, it's used to have lovely parties.
After January the 12th, all these things have changed.
Because right now, we are seeing one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven...
You can't count.
You can't count.
No, no.
But we are seeing dozens and dozens of tents on this lawn, directly in front of
us.
There's a family getting dressed and showering.
I mean, it's like we're standing in this family's bedroom.
Yeah.
They don't have any bedroom.
They don't have any privacy.
And you see, there is no more life, no more dignity.
I don't want to be undignified, but we just saw this woman.
She was naked from the top up while she was showering out in public.
There's babies being changed.
There's people trying to make breakfast.
No, not breakfast.
People are trying to sell their goods.
So it turns out, as Jean-Paul Lem explained, in all these tent cities, there are these
little one-person businesses, people carrying around plastic tubs filled with food.
And right when Jean-Paul Lem and I were talking, we saw this woman selling stuff
to that family that was changing their baby right next to us.
And I have to tell you, she was this really skinny, really muscular woman.
And she was carrying this massive tub on her head.
Yeah, I actually have a photo on our website, NPR.org slash money.
And it's incredible seeing this thing bounce right on the top of her head there.
Yeah, I actually asked her how she got such a heavy thing onto her head.
She answered, of course, in Creole.
So Jean-Paul Lem did the translating.
Well, sometimes it is too heavy.
I request some people to help me to lift it on my head.
Can you show me what's inside?
It's a big box of chicken neck.
It's a box of chicken.
Yeah.
And the box says, frozen chicken neck from Argentina.
It's 15 kilos.
That's like 35 pounds, 40 pounds.
35 to 40 pounds.
And you have a cutting board and a machete.
Yeah.
By the way, quick correction, I looked up 15 kilos is closer to 33 pounds.
Nice fact checking.
Still, it's very heavy on your head.
So Jean-Paul Lem and I stopped and talked with her and had her explain how her business
works.
Her name is Yves-Rose Jean-Baptiste, and she explained that this business of carrying
chicken necks in a tub around a tent city is a huge step down for her.
Before the earthquake, she had a thriving small business.
Which she explained to you guys how it worked.
There's a small microcredit bank that would lend her 5,000 Haitian dollars.
That's around 600 US.
She would take that money and go to the border of the Dominican Republic.
Remember that Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola.
Dominican Republic is certainly not wealthy by US standards, but it's a far more prosperous
country than Haiti is.
So Yves-Rose would take the bus a few hours to the border, buy some goods that
were not available in Port-au-Prince, or at least were cheaper in the Dominican
Republic, and bring them back.
All sorts of goods.
Corns, oats meal, flour meal.
So that's partly alimentation products.
So she's a wholesaler?
A very small level wholesaler?
Very small level.
She goes to the Dominican Republic, she buys with the 5,000 Haitian dollars that
she has borrowed from the microcredit institutions.
So she comes back here and she retails to those people who have shops and small boutiques.
And after that, every 15 days she gets back to them to collect her money back.
So she extends credit?
Yeah, she prior from the bank, she goes to the Dominican Republic, comes back,
she retails to those resellers, and 15 days later she gets back.
So she has close to two tons of the money per month.
So just to make clear, she's not just borrowing the money, buying stuff, and selling the stuff.
She's borrowing the money and then lending it out again, basically.
She's giving these shop owners the goods on credit, and then she's collecting money
once they sell the goods.
This is a common business practice all over the U.S., you know, consignment.
It's done in bookstores and supermarkets and wine shops.
And Wall Street.
Exactly.
It's actually a really good example, because like any banker, she is borrowing at one
rate and lending out at a higher rate and keeping the difference.
And instead of lending out mortgages, she's lending out foodstuffs.
But it's the same basic business model.
It's interest rate arbitrage.
And that alone is really complicated and hard to keep track of.
But she also has 10 different clients, those shop owners that she sells the goods
through.
She sells a bunch of different products with obviously different prices and different levels
of demand.
She has to monitor interest rates.
She has to monitor customer demand, cash flow, loan maturities.
And she's doing all of this without a computer.
Do you have a notebook where you keep down, I lent him this, I have this?
Because you have to balance so many figures.
She said that she has her book where she has the list of all her clients.
Do you have it on you?
No, no, no, no.
She said that she has her book, she has her book.
She hides this book somewhere, even though her house was collapsed, but she still has
the book.
Eve Rose got back from her last trip to the Dominican Republic the day before the
earthquake.
She bought about 500 US dollars worth of goods.
So the next morning she distributed most of those goods to her various clients and she
left some of them at home.
Then that afternoon the earthquake hit.
It destroyed her house and all the goods she had there.
It actually destroyed pretty much all the businesses of all of her clients.
So it destroyed all the goods she had brought back from the Dominican Republic.
Several of her clients died in the earthquake and none of them are in a position
to pay her back for what she had lent them.
So all her inventory, what she bought with that loan, is gone.
But the bank that gave her the loan is still open for business and of course still expects
her to pay it back.
So now she is thinking what she is going to do by tomorrow.
Because normally on the 7th, the money that she has borrowed from the microcrediting
institutions, on every 7th of the month, she should pay back.
Wait, tomorrow is the 7th?
No, today is the 7th.
As it is Sunday.
So you are due today.
And tomorrow she doesn't know what she is going to say to the bank.
How much do you owe them tomorrow?
700.
Tomorrow morning she should pay 700 US dollars.
How many US is that?
It is close to 100.
100 US dollars?
80, 90, 12 to 95 US dollars.
And how close are you?
How much do you have?
She is not close to it because it is only with this she is trying to turn around and
see if she can get some money back.
By this he means the bucket full of chicken necks.
The chicken necks, it turns out, were Yves Rose's only hope.
She had bought them from a local dealer, they were frozen from Argentina, and to buy them
she had to take out another loan.
But this loan was not from a microcredit institution, it was from a loan shark.
And the interest rate was 20% in two weeks.
That is versus the 12% she owed the microcredit bank and that was in eight months.
So it is a huge, huge difference in interest rate.
So now she is deeper in debt.
She has a loan due to the microcredit bank and to the loan shark.
And if everything goes perfectly.
If she sells all the chicken necks she has, she will only clear about $3 or $4 US in profit.
And then maybe she could buy another box of chicken necks tomorrow and get another
$3 or $4.
So she is not going to make anything close to the $100 she owes.
If she is lucky, she can probably stay ahead of the loan shark, but she has no possible
way of paying off the microcredit bank.
Now remember, Jean Parlem is the chief economic advisor to the Prime Minister of Haiti.
This day that he spent with us was his first chance to check in on the post-earthquake
economy because he had spent the previous few weeks saving lives, getting food and
water to needy people.
So now he said it was time to start helping people like Yves Rose.
Now we need to come back in the reality of these people who tried to come back
in business, tried to take care of themselves instead of staying waiting for some food.
And you see, whenever you find people fighting for a better living or to rebuild themselves
without any assistance, you see, she went to take a credit with a very, very high
interest rate and a very, very short term, trying to rebuild her capital to recapitalize.
That's things that we will have to look at very, very importantly.
Are you going to tell the Prime Minister about her?
I have to talk about that.
So you and Jean Parlem talked to Yves Rose for a little bit, and she told you
Basically, she has a plan.
The reason she's doing all this, the business, is for her kids.
They're in school, which in Haiti is supposed to be free, but which ends up with uniforms
and books and the occasional bribe, being prohibitively expensive for much of Haiti's
poor, which is to say for much of Haiti.
Remember, well over two-thirds of Haitians live on less than $2 a day.
Yves Rose has a fifth grade education, but before the earthquake, she said she was
making $100 a week, $100 US.
That is unbelievable for someone from her background in Haiti, and probably about as
rich as she could ever hope to be.
But her dream was that her kids would finish high school, that they would be on a whole
other income bracket than she could ever hope to be.
And if she's able to provide that future for her kids, then Jean Parlem says maybe
she's also part of providing a future for her entire country.
That's what he's going to tell the prime minister, that we need, that Haiti needs
to do all it can to help people like Yves Rose.
If somewhere we can develop kind of financial support to decrease the interest rate for
such people and to increase the magnitude of their business, it's simple.
With less than $1,000 US, she has more than 10 clients, and she is having business every
week between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
And she's paying school for her children, house for them, clothes, food, and everything.
So if she were in a better position to do much more business, let's say double
the business, she told you that by week she has $600 to $700 Haitian dollars back,
close to $100.
That's a lot of money for her, given her situation.
So it means that with a little push, how useful could we be to work beside these people?
I know you said that that can happen, that her children will move her into the
middle class. Does it happen?
Like, is that something that really does happen?
It does happen. It does happen.
I'm not going to go through all the history with you, but maybe I'm one of the cases.
You're one of the cases. Wait, no, no. Tell us about you.
Maybe. I don't know for him and I don't know for those people, but my mom,
dad, when I was very young.
Your mom died.
Yeah. And she left six children.
I was the last one.
And so my dad, he's a peasant, peasant from living on agricultural, on his agricultural land.
Does he have education?
He's been maybe at school for five years, like this lady, six to five years.
So you talk to her and how do you feel when you talk to her, you feel?
Very close to what I know.
And for that reason, I can talk to her with so freely.
So the dream that she has is not too complicated.
It's your father's dream.
My father told us that I am not going to buy land to live for you because in the
country, the wealth that a family can transmit to his children was partly the land.
And he told us that even if I have some money, I'm not going to buy land for any one of you.
I'm putting your wealth in your head.
So I send you to school.
Make your do your best to learn is everything that I can give you is that thing.
So take it and take it very seriously.
Was that a good idea?
I think that was the best advice that I've got in my life.
At Planet Money, we've been talking about global poverty for months.
But this conversation with Yves-Rose really helped me understand it on such a deeper level.
There's this Creole word that I kept hearing all the time in Haiti, Brasse.
And it means something like squeezing every penny out of every nickel, trying to make
every little bit of money you have earn a little bit more.
It's a very entrepreneurial idea and Yves-Rose epitomized it.
She's clearly a master at Brasse.
But even someone as good as she is, is in such a tenuous position.
The earthquake obviously was a huge shock to her and to the entire country.
But almost any kind of shock, let's say she broke her leg or she got robbed on
the way back from the Dominican Republic or one of her kids got sick or one of her
clients ripped her off, anything like that, and she would be wiped out.
She is on such a thin margin.
So her only shot is to have nothing go wrong ever for her entire life.
Jean Palin said this thing to you, Adam, that he's where he is today because he
got one lucky break.
His sister decided to work harder and pay for his schooling.
That's why he has a PhD and isn't an illiterate peasant like some of his cousins.
And he says Yves-Rose is hoping to give her kids that one lucky break, the same
one that he got.
And he says most Haitians, they don't even get that.
They get zero lucky breaks.
But most people in wealthy countries, we get so many breaks.
We forget we're even lucky sometimes.
We're going to check back in with Yves-Rose in the coming weeks and find out how her
business is doing, how her loans to the banks are doing.
And we'll bring you more on that as soon as we find out.
I think that wraps it up for us today, though.
