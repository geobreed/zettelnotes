A few years back, when the housing market was going nuts, people didn't know we were in the middle of a gigantic bubble.

That, of course, is how we wound up with Toxie, Planet Money's pet toxic asset.

On today's podcast, we travel back to 2005, the year Toxie was created from thousands of home mortgages.

And we talk to Lisa Liberator-Kinney, who bought a home in Bradenton, Florida during the bubble — and whose mortgage wound up in our toxic asset.

Here's Lisa on what it felt like to buy a house in Florida during the boom:

    It was actually exciting for most people because people were like, "Yeah, I bought my house years ago and its triple — it's worth triple what it was worth." . . .

    How do you know it's not just a growing area and the time to get in on something, versus this is gonna burst and it's not going to be worth it in the end? . . .

    It was like, if there is a bubble and if it does go, the market's just going to stop growing as fast, or the values will just remain what they are at the moment it bursts.

Of course, that's not what happened. Here's the Case-Shiller home-price index for the Miami area:

JAMES GAMMON: (Singing) Did she find you on Wall Street and follow you home? Was she left at your door in a basket of loans? She's Toxie, the toxic asset.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. Today's Tuesday, September 14. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. That was a song called "Toxie The Toxic Asset" you heard at the top of the podcast, written for us by listener Andrew Breton. It showed up one day on our Facebook page. Thanks, Andrew.

JOFFE-WALT: Today on the show, episode number one.

KESTENBAUM: (Vocalizing to "The Imperial March").

JOFFE-WALT: Are you doing "Star Wars" now?

KESTENBAUM: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: This here is our origin story for Toxie. We're going to fill in a missing chapter in Toxie's life that somehow we have skipped up until now.

KESTENBAUM: Our toxic asset for new listeners is something we at PLANET MONEY bought as a sort of pet back in January. It's a piece of a huge mortgage bond. And bonds like these were central to the financial crisis. Our bond was created in 2005 during the housing bubble. Wall Street made it by buying up thousands of home mortgages all over the country, packaging them together and selling off pieces to investors.

JOFFE-WALT: For a while, it was going great. In fact, we have a time warp indicator today from Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: This time warp PLANET MONEY indicator comes to us from 2005, the year of Toxie's birth. And the indicator is 1,371, which is how many private mortgage-backed securities were created that year, along with Toxie. So we had 1,371 Toxies. Just for comparison, this year there have been a total of five new private mortgage-backed securities that were created through the end of August.

KESTENBAUM: Just five.

GOLDSTEIN: Right?

KESTENBAUM: That's amazing.

GOLDSTEIN: The baby boom is over.

KESTENBAUM: But there are some new Toxies being born.

GOLDSTEIN: Being born, yes. Toxie, I would not say - you know, one of these new assets was described earlier this year, and it was, like, ridiculously safe, the anti-Toxie. The homeowners had very low debt. They had very good credit, which, of course, is totally different than what these things looked like back in the day. Tons of them were full of subprime mortgages, and the market was huge. I mean, for 2005, all of the Toxies created were worth over $1 trillion - a trillion dollars - I mean, really a phenomenally large market, right? And by the way, I should thank the guys at Asset-Backed Alert. They pulled together this data for me to talk about today.

JOFFE-WALT: Ah, 2005. Those were the good old days. Thank you, Jacob Goldstein.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

JOFFE-WALT: So on with the show. Toxie's birth, chapter one in the life of our toxic asset. So, of course, we all know now that Toxie is a toxic asset and that she's caused a lot of problems. What's been interesting about learning more about the chapter one of her life is that if you read carefully, there are all these signs that this story, this whole idea of bundling mortgages together and selling them to investors - there were signs along the way that it wasn't going to end well.

KESTENBAUM: But most of the first chapter is about really happy times. And our story begins with a homeowner or, actually, a woman who really wanted to be a homeowner. Her name is Lisa Liberator-Kinney. She's a pharmaceutical rep. She's married to a police officer. And in March of 2005, she and her husband were in Florida, doing what people all over the country were doing - looking for a home.

LISA LIBERATOR-KINNEY: You couldn't find homes at that time. So we got kind of lucky and felt very fortunate when we first purchased our house.

JOFFE-WALT: Lisa and her husband started going to open houses, and there were always so many people at these open houses. And she was never fast enough. They weren't having any luck. So then she and her husband just started driving around trying to find something, some home that other people hadn't seen yet.

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: We had bid on quite a few houses, and we would sign the paperwork, and it would be taken right out from under you. You know, legal or not, we had it happen quite a few times because someone would come along and pay cash and pay more than the asking price. And you could - you just couldn't find a home. And it would go up for sale, and you could be in there that hour, and it would still get taken out from under you.

KESTENBAUM: So when that didn't work, Lisa and her husband moved on to a new strategy. No houses available - fine. They would build one. All they needed was some land. But even that was so competitive. There were so many people looking to buy land that the owners were doing lotteries.

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: You know, you just put your name in, and you hoped that it got drawn out. So to purchase any land and even build a house, it was all by lottery.

KESTENBAUM: And they never won the lottery.

JOFFE-WALT: Lisa and her husband did eventually find a house that they liked on East Dover Drive in 2005, and they jumped on it. They got a loan from the local bank. But that loan is no longer at that bank down the street. It got sold to Wall Street. And it got thrown into a pile with thousands of other mortgages and put into a bond, a bond that you all now know as Toxie.

KESTENBAUM: Lisa is one of the homeowners in Toxie, although she didn't know that until just last month, when she read about our Toxie project in the local paper.

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: It sounds so foreign when you hear it on the news. And it doesn't sound real. But then when you're a part of it and you kind of follow along, you're like, OK, now I can see how that happens.

JOFFE-WALT: Did you know that it ended up in one of these things?

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: No. And, you know, you just think, hey; I'm buying a home. But, you know, on the other end, they just turn around and sell you to somebody else, and then you kind of float out there to the best - you know, whoever wants to buy you, apparently.

KESTENBAUM: It's hard to imagine it now, but this was a time when Toxie was beloved.

JOFFE-WALT: Because Toxie and all of her mortgage-backed security pals had a wonderful way of connecting people who wanted to invest money - big pension funds and hedge funds - with people who needed to borrow money, like Lisa.

KESTENBAUM: Back in 2005, everyone loved Toxie. Wall Street loved her. The people there were collecting fees every time they put one of these bonds together. Hedge funds, pension funds, insurance funds loved her because these bonds were supposed to be safe and they paid a decent return. And homebuyers loved her also because they got to get a nice low-interest loan to buy a new house.

JOFFE-WALT: So all of a sudden, there are oceans of new money moving into the real estate world, available to a large portion of the public who wanted to buy a home. And that is why every time Lisa looked at a home, there were so many people to compete with at all the open houses and all the lotteries. They were just mobbed because of this.

KESTENBAUM: So, Chana, remember how we said there are things in this chapter that, in retrospect, look like really heavy-handed foreshadowing? For instance, I'm looking at this chart of housing prices in Florida. And in 2005, they are shooting up like crazy. A house in Miami, for instance, over just the past three years before - the average house would have increased in value by 65%.

JOFFE-WALT: And if you, like Lisa, are going to open house after open house, the stories that you are hearing there are even more dramatic.

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: It was actually, you know, exciting for most people because people were like, yeah, I bought my house two years ago and now it's triple. You know, it's worth triple what it was worth.

KESTENBAUM: Do you look back and say, oh, it should have been obvious that was a bubble?

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: You know, yeah. You know, I don't know that you can ever tell. How do you spot it, you know? How do you know it's not just a growing area and, you know, the time to get in on something versus, you know, this is going to burst and it's not going to be worth at the end?

KESTENBAUM: How weird would it be to, like, get in a time machine and go back? You would feel like everyone was on some sort of strange drug or something, you know?

LIBERATOR-KINNEY: Yeah, I think so. And, you know, I could probably, you know, shout at the top of my lungs of what was to come and I don't think anyone would have paid any attention. You know, you think about it. When everyone's working so much and they're making so much money, people don't want to hear about that. You know, it's the last thing they want to hear. And if there were talks of a bubble, it was like, you know, if there is a bubble and if it does go, it's only just - you know, the market's just going to stop growing as fast. Or it's just going to - you know, the values will just remain what they are at the moment it bursts.

JOFFE-WALT: Houses were going up all over the place. Developers were buying up citrus groves and putting in new housing developments and immediately selling all those new houses.

KESTENBAUM: But here is warning sign number two - a lot of the time, those new houses, they'd be bought, but no one would move in.

JOFFE-WALT: So Tony Polito saw this firsthand. We went to talk to him. He's with a housing market research firm in Florida called Metrostudy. And what they would do is they would do more than just look at the sales data. They would actually go out and see, is there a car in the driveway? Did someone really move into this new house? And a lot of the time, the answer was no. They were bought by investors.

TONY POLITO: There isn't a profile of who an investor is. It's not a Wall Street-type fund that's going out and buying a home. It was literally any mom-and-pop, anyone that could find mortgage money, going out and buying it. It could be an executive at a power company. It could be a dishwasher at a restaurant. All of them were out trying to buy homes in this marketplace.

JOFFE-WALT: Not to live in.

POLITO: Correct. Just to buy them, flip them, make some money and move on.

JOFFE-WALT: These were some of the people who were making it hard for Lisa to buy a home. So Tony Polito says 30 to 40% of Lisa's competition were investors. So he told us builders would be building all these new homes, and they'd get curious, putting in air conditioner after air conditioner and more drywall after drywall. Is anyone coming? Because the houses kept getting bought as soon as they were built, but a lot of those air conditioners never got used. No one ever hung anything on the drywall or even opened the front door. They were empty in 2005, and they're still empty now.

POLITO: Absolutely. A lot of those are older homes, 3 and 4 years old, that were bought during the boom time - never been occupied.

KESTENBAUM: What's it like to walk around those neighborhoods?

POLITO: It's, quite honestly, a little scary. They're overgrown. In fact, I've seen newspaper stories down in Fort Myers where they had all kinds of big, large lizards living in these homes. There were stories of people just coming across all kinds of animals and vermin that are in these neighborhoods and areas. But the fact is, they're unkept. They're not appealing. There's not a great chance of selling them for anything even near market rate today.

JOFFE-WALT: So you would think that Tony Polito and the folks at Metrostudy who are going out and seeing that no one was moving into these homes saw this bubble forming. But they did not. At the time, what they told people who asked was that they expected some sort of decline in the housing market, but not a cliff.

KESTENBAUM: So how did everyone miss this? Well, let's take a look at those warning signs. Warning sign number one was sort of that chart of home prices shooting up crazily. There were ways to explain that. For instance, you had Toxie. And Toxie was helping connect pension funds and insurance funds, people who had money with homeowners who needed to borrow. So that was making it easier for people to buy homes. That was providing new money for people who wanted to buy homes. And that was going to push the price of houses up.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. So warning sign number two, investors were buying homes, but they weren't moving in. They weren't living in them.

Well, OK. But they had this story that they were telling themselves, which is that people were going to move to Florida. You know, didn't you hear point one? Everyone was going to have all this money to buy homes, and then they were going to retire in Florida.

KESTENBAUM: Tony Polito says this is a story people were telling themselves. Everyone was going to come for the sun and the coastline and the easy life. But then he turned to his laptop, and he pulled up something really chilling.

POLITO: I want to show you something. This is just an aerial, you know, photograph of one area of Charlotte County.

JOFFE-WALT: This is really eerie. Tony pulls up a mapping program on his laptop, and we're looking at an aerial photo of a neighborhood. And we're basically looking at a different kind of warning sign. This is a warning sign that people in Florida didn't have to add up data about rising home prices, didn't have to count how many people at an open house were investors. All they would've had to do to see this warning sign would be to drive a couple neighborhoods over, get off the highway at probably a rarely used exit, and open their eyes.

KESTENBAUM: The aerial photo shows what looks like a typical Florida development, you know, cul-de-sacs, the little winding roads arranged in row after row after row, except there are no homes. There is nothing. And this is not the wreckage of the 2005 bubble. This is from 1970.

POLITO: These were lots that were put in in the 1970s. A lot of this was general development and developed in the '70s, part of that come to Florida, fly and buy, buy land cheap in Florida.

KESTENBAUM: So this isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened in Florida.

POLITO: Yeah. The difference, though, in the past was it was the land development side. This time it was actual homes being built and being speculated upon.

KESTENBAUM: So these are like - these are streets that have been named and put up exactly where you'd expect, like, identical house after identical house. But there are just trees there. No one's actually built on them.

POLITO: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: It's weird. It's weird. It's like a grid for the suburb, but there are no houses put on it.

POLITO: And that's why there is a hundred-plus year supply of lots in Charlotte County.

JOFFE-WALT: A hundred-plus years' supply?

POLITO: Yes. In fact, it's probably over that now.

KESTENBAUM: It's so creepy. I can't imagine what it's like to walk around.

POLITO: That one's nothing. You got to come down in Lehigh Acres. Actually, some of these streets have been there so long with nothing going on you can see trees growing up in the roads.

JOFFE-WALT: Tony told us in the 1970s, developers advertised these places as having playgrounds and schools. In the 2005 boom, they were advertising golf courses, sunshine and wheelchair ramps.

POLITO: The funny thing is it was still the same target buyer. It was the baby boomer, at that time turning 25 to 30 years old, as opposed to turning 65 years old now.

JOFFE-WALT: So it was the same exact person.

POLITO: A lot of it was marketed towards that same age group demographic back then that they're still marketing to them today.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOXIE THE TOXIC ASSET")

GAMMON: (Singing) She's a complex lady. She's sketchy. She's shady. And AAA-rated she ain't. No, she ain't. She's way underwater. They broker her. You bought her. The TARP never caught her. How great. For the moment...

KESTENBAUM: So, Chana, we've been asking a lot around here, why do we suck so much at spotting what, in retrospect, seemed like clear warning signs of a bubble? Is this just some bad movie that we're going to replay every generation or so?

JOFFE-WALT: And it seems like a particularly appropriate question now that Toxie, our toxic asset, is nearing the end of her life. And we can tell Toxie is sick because the last couple months we've gotten payments for $0.00.

KESTENBAUM: So the way it works for us as investors is that there are 2,000 or so homeowners whose mortgages are in Toxie. Every month, they make their mortgage payments, and we get some part of that in the check, although the last couple of months that has not been happening. We got $0.00.

Lisa Liberator-Kinney is still making her payments, but more than half the homeowners are not. And a lot of the homes are getting taken over and sold for a loss.

JOFFE-WALT: There are a lot of losses. So now that we have covered the first chapter of Toxie's life, the only Toxie chapter left is the last. And we would like your help in writing it. We plan to remember her with a sort of ceremonial podcast next week. And here's what we want to know from you. How do you think Toxie should be remembered? Like, what would you say at her funeral? You can send us a couple lines at planetmoney@npr.org.

KESTENBAUM: Or you can call a special Toxie memorial hotline we've set up. That's 202-408-1271.

JOFFE-WALT: 202-408-1271. And you can see that aerial photograph of named but completely unoccupied suburban streets in Florida on our blog, npr.org/money. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "TOXIE THE TOXIC ASSET")

GAMMON: (Singing) ...Was digging in deeper. You wanted to keep her but couldn't. For all of your cursing, there's no reimbursing. There's no way of nursing her back. Our Toxie will perish. We'll look back and cherish before things were bearish and black. It's Toxie, the toxic asset. She's selling a risky mortgage basket. It recently dawned you may have been conned. They delivered your bond in a casket.

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome to Planet Money, today's Tuesday, September 14th.
I'm Khanna Jaffee-Walt.
And I'm David Kestinbaum.
That was a song called Toxy the Toxic Asset you heard at the top of the podcast written
for us by listener Andrew Bretton.
It showed up one day on our Facebook page.
Thanks, Andrew.
Today on the show, episode number one.
You're doing Star Wars now?
This here is our origin story for Toxy.
We're going to fill in a missing chapter in Toxy's life that somehow we have skipped
up until now.
Our toxic asset for new listeners is something we at Planet Money bought as a sort of pet
back in January.
It's a piece of a huge mortgage bond, and bonds like these were central to the
financial crisis.
Our bond was created in 2005 during the housing bubble.
Wall Street made it by buying up thousands of home mortgages all over the country, packaging
them together and selling off pieces to investors.
For a while, it was going great.
In fact, we have a Time Warp indicator today from Jacob Goldstein.
Today's Time Warp Planet Money indicator comes to us from 2005, the year of Toxy's
indicator is 1,371, which is how many private mortgage-backed securities were created that
year along with Toxy.
So we had 1,371 Toxys.
Just for comparison, this year there have been a total of five, five new private
mortgage-backed securities that were created through the end of August.
Just five?
That's amazing.
Right?
The baby boom is over.
But there are some new Toxys being born.
Yes, Toxy, I would not say.
One of these new assets was described earlier this year, and it was like ridiculously safe,
the anti-Toxy.
The homeowners had very low debt, they had very good credit, which of course is totally
different than what these things looked like back in the day.
Tons of them were full of subprime mortgages, and the market was huge.
For 2005, all of the Toxys created were worth over $1 trillion, a trillion dollars.
Really a phenomenally large market, right?
And by the way, I should thank the guys at Asset-Backed Alert.
They pulled together this data for me to talk about today.
Ah, 2005.
Those were the good old days.
Thank you, Jacob Goldstein.
Thanks, guys.
So on with the show, Toxy's birth, chapter one in the life of our toxic asset.
So of course we all know now that Toxy is a toxic asset and that she's caused
a lot of problems.
What's been interesting about learning more about the chapter one of her life is
if you read carefully, there are all these signs that this story, this whole idea of
bundling mortgages together and selling them to investors, there were signs along the
way that it wasn't going to end well.
But most of the first chapter is about really happy times.
And our story begins with a homeowner, or actually a woman who really wanted to
be a homeowner.
Her name is Lisa Liberator Kinney.
She's a pharmaceutical rep.
She's married to a police officer.
And in March of 2005, she and her husband were in Florida doing what people all
over the country were doing, looking for a home.
You couldn't find homes at that time.
So we got kind of lucky and felt very fortunate when we first purchased our house.
Lisa and her husband started going to open houses.
And there were always so many people at these open houses.
And she was never fast enough.
They weren't having any luck.
So then she and her husband just started driving around trying to find something,
some home that other people hadn't seen yet.
We had bid on quite a few houses and we would sign the paperwork and it would be taken right
out from under you, you know, legal or not.
We had it happen quite a few times because someone would come along and pay cash and
pay more than the asking price.
And you just couldn't find a home.
It would go up for sale and you could be in there that hour and it would still
get taken out from under you.
So when that didn't work, Lisa and her husband moved on to a new strategy.
No houses available.
Fine.
They would build one.
All they needed was some land.
But even that was so competitive.
There were so many people looking to buy land that the owners were doing lotteries.
You know, you just put your name in and you hoped that it got drawn out.
So to purchase any land and even build a house, it was all by lottery.
And they never won the lottery.
Lisa and her husband did eventually find a house that they liked on East Dover Drive
in 2005 and they jumped on it.
They got a loan from the local bank.
But that loan is no longer at that bank down the street.
It got sold to Wall Street and it got thrown into a pile with thousands of other
mortgages and put into a bond.
A bond that you all now know as Toxy.
Lisa is one of the homeowners in Toxy.
Although she didn't know that until just last month when she read about our Toxy
project in the local paper.
It sounds so foreign when you hear it on the news.
And it doesn't sound real.
But then you're a part of it and you kind of follow along.
You're like, OK, now I can see how that happens.
Did you know that it ended up in one of these things?
No.
And, you know, you just think, hey, I'm buying a home.
But, you know, on the other end, they just turn around and sell you to
somebody else.
And then you kind of float out there to the best, you know, whoever
wants to buy you, apparently.
It's hard to imagine it now.
But this was a time when Toxy was beloved.
And all of her mortgage-backed security pals had a wonderful way of
connecting people who wanted to invest money, big pension funds and
hedge funds, with people who needed to borrow money like Lisa.
Back in 2005, everyone loved Toxy.
Wall Street loved her.
The people there were collecting fees every time they put one of
these bonds together.
Hedge funds, pension funds, insurance funds loved her because
these bonds were supposed to be safe and they paid a decent return.
And home buyers loved her also because they got to get a nice
low-interest loan to buy a new house.
So all of a sudden, there are oceans of new money moving into

public who wanted to buy a home.
And that is why every time Lisa looked at a home, there were
so many people to compete with that all the open houses and
all the lotteries, they were just mobbed because of this.
So, Hannah, remember how we said there are things in this
in retrospect look like really heavy-handed foreshadowing?
For instance, I'm looking at this chart of housing prices
in Florida, and in 2005, they are shooting up like crazy.
A house in Miami, for instance, over just the past three
years before, the average house would have increased in
value by 65%.
And if you, like Lisa, are going to open house after open
house, the stories that you are hearing there are even more
dramatic.
It was actually, you know, exciting for most people
because people were like, yeah, I bought my house two
years ago and now it's triple, you know, it's worth triple
what it was worth.
Do you look back and say, oh, it should have been
obvious that was a bubble?
You know, yeah, you know, I don't know that you can
ever tell.
How do you spot it, you know?
How do you know it's not just growing area and, you
know, the time to get in on something versus, you
know, this is going to burst and it's not going to be
worth it at the end.
How weird would it be to like get in a time machine
and go back?
You would feel like everyone was on some sort of
strange drug or something, you know?
Yeah, I think so.
And, you know, I could probably, you know, shout
it at the top of my lungs of what was to come and
I don't think anyone would have paid any
attention.
You know, you think about it when everyone's
working so much and they're making so much
money, people don't want to hear about that.
You know, it's the last thing they want to hear.
And if there were talks of a bubble, it was
like, ah, you know, if there is a bubble and if
it does go, it's only just, you know, the market's
just going to stop growing as fast or it's just
going to, you know, the values will just remain
what they are at the moment it bursts.
Houses were going up all over the place.
Developers were buying up citrus groves and
putting in new housing developments and
immediately selling all those new houses.
But here is warning sign number two.
A lot of the time, those new houses, they'd
be bought, but no one would move in.
So Tony Polito saw this firsthand.
We went to talk to him.
He's with a housing market research firm in
Florida called Metro Study.
And what they would do is they would do more
than just look at the sales data.
They would actually go out and see, is there
a car in the driveway?
Did someone really move into this new house?
And a lot of the time, the answer was no.
They were bought by investors.
There isn't a profile of who an investor is.
It's not a Wall Street type fund that's going
out and buying a home.
It was literally any mom and pop, anyone that
could find mortgage money going out and
buying it.
It could be an executive at a power company.
It could be a dishwasher at a restaurant.
All of them were out trying to buy homes
in this marketplace.
Not to live in.
Correct.
To buy them, flip them, make some money,
and move on.
These were some of the people who were
making it hard for Lisa to buy a home.
So Tony Polito says 30 to 40 percent of
Lisa's competition were investors.
So he told us builders would be building
all these new homes and they'd get curious
putting in air conditioner after air
conditioner and more drywall after drywall.
Is anyone coming?
Because the houses kept getting bought as
soon as they were built, but a lot of
those air conditioners never got used.
No one ever hung anything on the drywall
or even opened the front door.
They were empty in 2005 and they're
still empty now.
Absolutely.
But a lot of those are older homes,
three and four years old, that were
bought during the boom time.
Never been occupied.
What's it like to walk around those
neighborhoods?
It's quite honestly a little scary.
They're overgrown.
In fact, I've seen newspaper stories
down in Fort Myers where they had all
kinds of big, large lizards living in
these homes.
There were stories of people just
coming across all kinds of animals and
vermin that are in these
neighborhoods and areas.
But the fact is they're unkept.
They're not appealing.
There's not a great chance of selling
them for anything even near a market
rate today.
So you would think that Tony Polito
and the folks at Metro Study who were
going out and seeing that no one was
moving into these homes saw this bubble
forming.
But they did not.
At the time, what they told people who
asked was that they expected some sort
of decline in the housing market but
not a cliff.
So how did everyone miss this?
Well, let's take a look at those
warning signs.
Warning sign number one was sort of
that chart of home prices shooting up
crazily.
There were ways to explain that.
For instance, you had Toxi.
And Toxi was helping connect pension
funds and insurance funds.
People had money with homeowners
who needed to borrow.
So that was making it easier for people
to buy homes.
That was providing new money for people
who wanted to buy homes.
And that was going to push the price
of houses up.
OK.
So warning sign number two,
investors were buying homes, but they
weren't moving in.
They weren't living in them.
Well, OK.
But they had this story that they
were telling themselves, which is that
people were going to move to Florida.
You know, didn't you hear point one?
Everyone was going to have all this
money to buy homes.
And then they were going to retire
in Florida.
Tony Polito says this is a story people
were telling themselves.
Everyone was going to come for the sun
and the coastline and the easy life.
But then he turned to his laptop
and he pulled up something really
chilling.
I want to show you something.
This is just an aerial photograph,
you know, photograph of one area of
Charlotte County.
This is really eerie.
Tony pulls up a mapping program on
his laptop and we're looking at an
aerial photo of a neighborhood.
And we're basically looking at a
different kind of warning sign.
This is a warning sign that people
in Florida didn't have to add up
data about rising home prices.
They didn't have to count how many
people at an open house were
investors.
All they would have had to do to
see this warning sign would be to
drive a couple neighborhoods over,
get off the highway at probably a
rarely used exit, and open their
eyes.
The aerial photo shows what looks
like a typical Florida development,
you know, cul-de-sacs, little
winding roads arranged in row after
row after row.
Except there are no homes.
There is nothing.
And this is not the wreckage of
the 2005 bubble.
This is from 1970.
These were lots that were put in
in the 1970s.
A lot of this was general
development and developed in the
70s.
Part of that, come to Florida,
fly and buy, buy land cheap in
Florida.
So this isn't the first time this
kind of thing has happened in
Florida?
Yeah.
The difference though in the
past was it was the land
development side.
This time it was actual homes
being built and being
speculated upon.
So these are like houses, these
are streets that have been
named and put up exactly where
you'd expect like identical
house after identical house, but
they're just trees there.
No one's actually built on
them.
It's weird.
It's weird.
It's like a grid for the
suburb, but there are no
houses put on it.
That's the difference.
That's the difference.
The difference is that the
number is a hundred plus year
supply of lots in Charlotte
County.
That's a hundred plus years
supply?
Yes.
In fact, it's probably over
that now.
That's so creepy.
I can't imagine what it's
like to walk around.
No, that one's nothing
yet to come down.
In Lehigh Acres, actually
some of these streets have
been there so long with
nothing going on.
You can see trees growing up
in the roads.
Tony told us in the
1970s, developers
advertised these places as
having playgrounds and
schools.
In the 2005 boom, they
were advertising golf
courses, sunshine, and
wheelchair ramps.
The funny thing is it was
still the same target
buyer.
It was the baby boomer at
that time turning 25 to 30
years old as opposed to
turning 65 years old now.
It was the same exact
person.
A lot of it was marketed
towards that same age group
demographic back then that
they're still marketing
to them today.
So, Hannah, we've been
asking a lot around here.
Why do we suck so much
at spotting what in
retrospect seem like
clear warning signs of
a bubble?
Is this just some bad
movie that we're going
to replay every
generation or so?
It seems like a
particularly appropriate
question now that Toxy,
our toxic asset, is
nearing the end of
her life.
We can tell Toxy is
sick because the
last couple of months
we've gotten payments
for zero dollars and
zero cents.
So the way it works for
us as investors is that
there are 2,000 or so
homeowners whose
mortgages are in Toxy.
Every month they make
their mortgage payments
and we get some part
of that in a check,
although the last
couple months that has
not been happening.
We got zero dollars
and zero cents.
Lisa Liberator-Kinney
is still making her
payments, but more
than half the
homeowners are not
and a lot of the
homes are getting
taken over and sold
for a loss.
There are a lot
of losses.
So now that we have
covered the first
chapter of Toxy's
life, the only Toxy
chapter left is the
last and we would like
your help in
writing it.
We plan to remember
her with a sort of
ceremonial podcast
next week.
And here is what
we want to know from
you.
How do you think
Toxy should be
remembered?
What would you
say at her funeral?
You can send us
a couple lines
at planetmoney
at npr.org.
Or you can call
a special Toxy
Memorial Hotline
we've set up.
That's 202-408-1271.
202-408-1271.

of named but
completely unoccupied
suburban streets
