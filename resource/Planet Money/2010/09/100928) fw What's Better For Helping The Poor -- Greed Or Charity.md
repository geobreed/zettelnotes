Say you want to make loans to millions of poor women in the developing world, to help them climb out of poverty.

Is it OK to raise money from rich investors, who expect to make a profit?

Muhammad Yunus, the father of microfinance, says no. If you have investors who expect profits, you'll ultimately turn into something more like a loan-shark than a do-gooder.

Vikram Akula, founder of SKS Microfinance — a company that had an IPO earlier this year — says raising money from profit-seeking investors is the only way to spread microfinance quickly around the world.

On today's Planet Money, Akula and Yunus hash out their differences.

The podcast is adapted from a panel discussion that Adam Davidson moderated at last week's Clinton Global Initiative.

For more on the Yunus-Akula debate, check out this blog post from David Roodman, who's working on a book about microfinance.

Here's the panel in its entirety:

ANDREW SHERRILL: We estimate that female managers earned $0.81 on the dollar for every dollar earned by male managers, compared to $0.79 in 2000.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Today is Tuesday, September 28, and that was director Andrew Sherrill of the GAO, talking about what seems to me like a fairly pathetic narrowing gender pay gap, that you heard at the top of the show. On the podcast today, we ask a fundamental economic question - can good come out of greed? And to look at that question, we have a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus.

First, our PLANET MONEY indicator from Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator is 0.6%. That's how much U.S. home prices rose between June and July of this year. That's from the Case-Shiller Index, which is probably the most important measure of home prices in this country.

DAVIDSON: Kind of like the Dow Jones of home prices.

GOLDSTEIN: If you will.

DAVIDSON: All right. So this morning, I saw this number. Housing prices went up 0.6%. And I swear, I had this big smile on my face because, you know, Jacob, you come on this podcast month after month, week after week, and say how horrible the housing market in the U.S. is. And here is perfect proof - 0.6% rise in house prices. The housing market is getting stronger. That means maybe the economy is getting stronger because people are buying houses. They're feeling confident. We're coming back, baby. There is no way you can turn this into your usual bad news.

GOLDSTEIN: It is really good news. It's really good news about what housing prices were doing this spring. It doesn't really tell us anything about what housing prices are doing right now. The housing numbers we got today are for July. That's already a few months back. And then, on top of that, Case-Shiller uses a rolling three-month average. So what that means is, the July numbers are actually an average of May, June and July. So here we are - it's the end of September, and we're seeing numbers influenced by what was going on all the way back in May. And on top of that, in the past few weeks, we've seen all these other housing indicators for July and August that suggest pretty clearly that there is this glut of unsold homes on the market, and those are likely to be putting downward pressure on house prices already.

JOFFE-WALT: So a very long way of saying those monthly gains in the Case-Shiller probably aren't going to continue.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And in fact, housing prices could already have begun to fall. We just won't know it from Case-Shiller for a while yet.

JOFFE-WALT: Always trusty Goldstein style - you think it's good, but I'm actually going to tell you why it's not.

GOLDSTEIN: Makes me a little bit happy.

JOFFE-WALT: Thank you, Jacob.

DAVIDSON: Thanks, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

DAVIDSON: So Chana, I feel like one of the most difficult ideas in capitalism and capitalist economics is the idea that you might be able to help poor people more through greed than through charity. You know, this is an idea Adam Smith wrote about in "The Wealth Of Nations" - that people seeking profit will, often entirely by accident, end up making the world a better place than people seeking to do good. You know, like profit-seeking supermarkets and bakeries end up feeding a lot more people a lot more efficiently than nonprofit food banks - that kind of thing.

JOFFE-WALT: Exactly. So what we're looking at today is, what about efforts to explicitly help the poor? When people try explicitly to help the poor, does that work as well? And today, we're looking at microfinance. So that's lending small amounts of money to very poor people so they can start businesses and try to do better for themselves.

DAVIDSON: Last week, I moderated a panel at the Clinton Global Initiative. That's this annual thing in New York where for three days all these world leaders and business leaders and nonprofit people from all over the world get together and talk about and plan how to make the world a better place. And the panel I moderated was so interesting. I found it really powerful, and I thought that our listeners would enjoy it as well. So we're going to bring you much of that debate today.

Muhammad Yunus was there. He won the Nobel Peace Prize because he is the father of microfinance, one of the biggest revolutions in helping poor people become less poor. And his view is, it is simple - greed will not help the poor. No rich investor should ever make a profit from a business that lends money to poor people. Profit seeking, he says, will always end up hurting the poor.

JOFFE-WALT: In the other corner on this panel is Vikram Akula, the CEO and founder of SKS Microfinance, which is exactly the kind of company Yunus hates. SKS is not only for profit - it's now publicly traded on the stock exchange - and it has lots of rich investors making profits by lending money to very poor people in India. And Akula, who's Indian American, says at first, he was like Yunus. He started working for a nonprofit microfinance NGO that lived off tiny grants instead of investor money, and it sucked.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VIKRAM AKULA: Women from more remote areas would often come and say, can you start in our village? And we'd always have to say, no, you know, it's grant run, so we don't have funds, and we'd have to turn them away and they'd walk away disappointed. Now, on one particular day, a very poor woman - emaciated, torn sari, no chappals - she had clearly walked from quite a distance to ask me the same question. And again, I said, we don't have funds. We can't come into your village. But unlike the other women who simply walked away disappointed, she looked me in the eye and said something that I'll never forget. She said, am I not poor, too? Do I not deserve a chance to get my family out of poverty?

Now, for me, this was a jarring question because here I was thinking I'm doing something to help eradicate poverty, but this woman's question basically put me in my place, basically said, look, what are you doing if you're doing this only in a handful of villages and not doing it in the next set of villages? It's as if you're sending one child to school and holding the other one back. And that's when - I was so shook up by that question, I actually left my NGO, and I came up with the idea of using a highly commercial model so that you could access capital markets and go back to that woman or any poor woman anywhere in the world and say, yes, you, too, can have an opportunity.

JOFFE-WALT: Vikram says that SKS, by offering decent profits to investors, has grown insanely fast in a very short amount of time. It's reached millions of poor people in India who never would've had access to microloans. And he says the more money his investors make, the better his company does, the lower the interest rates he charges to customers.

DAVIDSON: Yunus says he doesn't even want to hear about this business logic because it's just wrong to make money that way. And he knows, even if it's helping them now, it's going to end up hurting the poor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MUHAMMAD YUNUS: So what we are opposed to, when you say profit or commercialization, it's money of the poor going out to somebody else. And you may say, well, what's wrong with taking a small amount of profit? Then I would say, is it small? Who defines that is small? How do you - do you have any rule that will keep it restricted to this percentage? You're not. It's an open thing. So anybody who makes profit can do that. So today, you may say, well, we are making only a small profit. But tomorrow, because of the system that you have, you like to maximize your profit.

You - it's a wrong direction. That's all I'm saying. We are not opposed to making profit - only who makes the profit out of the poor people and how much. That is the issue. If somebody said, oh, we are a restricted profit area, we take only 1% profit or 2% profit, I said, go right ahead. No problem. But the moment you say profit, the sky's the limit.

DAVIDSON: OK. And Vikram, I think, when we look at your personal biography, this is someone who devoted his career and his training to helping poor people. If you were trying to become a big, fancy bank CEO, you made a terrible series of career choices. But how do we trust that, 10 years from now, 40 years from now, SKS will continue to have serving the poor as central to its mission? The phrase in the literature is mission drift. And how is it not inevitable that the pull for profits will, you know, will outlast you and will eventually shift away from caring whether women are the main recipients or positive uses are made of the loans?

AKULA: We see at SKS Microfinance no conflict between the social mission that is our actual mission of helping to eradicate poverty and the commercial approach. Now, let me explain why this makes sense. In a typical financial services company, the idea is you push up loan sizes, for example, because that increases your profits. You raise interest rates to as high as you can because that increases your profits. At SKS Microfinance, to give you an example, our loan officers are not incentivized on loan size. Whether our loan officer gives a $40 loan to a woman - and we work 100% exclusively with women - or a $400 loan to a woman, he gets compensated in exactly the same way. Now, we do that because we want him to give the right loan amount for the right individual and not to push out something that may increase profits, but actually may not be good for her. Likewise, when it comes to interest, we could easily increase our interest rates to a much higher amount and probably not lose a single customer and extract from them because in many cases, we're in a monopoly situation. Yet we don't do so. We don't push out large loan sizes, and we don't charge the - what the market can bear in terms of interest. And we do that because it's socially, in terms of our mission, the right thing to do.

Having said that, let me give you the business logic. The business logic is, you create greater shareholder value not by extracting from someone when she takes a $40 loan, but rather by as she moves up the economic ladder and moves to a $400 loan, moves to taking three, four different insurance products, five, six different credit products from you That's when you create greater shareholder value. So the business logic actually lands you in exactly the same place that the social logic does.

YUNUS: If the Grameen or microcredit program is not owned by the borrowers, my next suggestion is, why didn't you make it - if it's owned by somebody else outside the borrowers - make it as a social business? And social business means we do it to make this loan available to you so that you can help yourself. We have no intention of making a penny out of your loan. So it's very clear upfront. We know that.

So the moment you do the other conventional business - conventional business has its own logic. No matter what Vikram says today, that logic will get him over. He cannot escape that. Today, he's very nice, very frank. He's telling this is his mission.

(LAUGHTER)

YUNUS: He is a good person. There's no problem with that. But he will be caught up by other interest into it because others are shareholders now. They will - give us the return. Where's my return coming up? So under that pressure, he will be gradually moving in. So all I am saying, it's wrong direction, and you'll end up in the wrong target.

DAVIDSON: Now, we should note that Yunus and Grameen Bank - you know, he's the guy who's against the kind of for-profit, investor-driven model - Yunus is in a very special situation. He and Grameen Bank don't have to look for investors to give them capital because they operate as a real bank, as a microbank. They go into a new area in Bangladesh, they open a bank and they take deposits from the poor villagers in that community, and they use that money to make loans to other poor people in that community. And the bank as a whole is owned by the villagers, so if there is any profit, it goes back to the villagers.

JOFFE-WALT: As opposed to investors from the outside.

DAVIDSON: As opposed to outside rich people investors.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. But most microfinance institutions around the world either can't or choose not to operate as banks, and a lot of times because many countries' banking laws make it very difficult to open a bank focused on poor customers. So instead, microfinance companies take charitable grants from foundations or individuals, or they go to investors and use that money to lend to poor people.

DAVIDSON: Yunus wants all those microfinance companies all over the world - the non-profits and the for-profits - to just become regular old-fashioned banks. That way, poor people can have savings accounts and not just loans. No money has to go out to investors as profits.

But the third panelist on this panel, Mary Ellen Iskenderian with Women's World Banking, says it is not so easy. In most countries, if a microfinance company wants to become a bank, they would have to lobby the government for new banking laws because it's basically illegal for them to become a microbank. And also, it's really hard to be a small bank. You need all these complicated computer systems to keep track of borrowers and depositors, and that's really, really expensive.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARY ELLEN ISKENDERIAN: We're working with four of our network members in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Kenya and Pakistan right now, and they're each at varying stages of the transition from NGO to regulated institution. And, you know, the one in Colombia, McKinsey comes in and does a study and tells them, you can't afford to raise deposits from your clientele until year five. You have to start going to the middle class and upper class for deposits. So we're working very hard to make that possible for them. But, you know, I don't think we should sort of gild the lily here. It is difficult to convince microfinance institutions to make that shift, to start taking deposits because it's very expensive.

DAVIDSON: Now, Vikram, why didn't you just become a bank?

AKULA: Well, the reality is that getting a banking license in India is nearly impossible. I think what Professor Yunus has achieved in Bangladesh is quite remarkable, but it is a slightly unique situation. It's a special act of parliament that created a bank that allowed for deposit-taking from borrowers. And it's a remarkable thing. But the reality is, in most developing countries, the central bank simply does not have that structure - certainly not in India. And if we were to lobby for that as we try and do, this is something that is sort of waiting for Godot. It'll take a bit of time before that actually does happen.

One of the challenges that the rest of the microfinance institutions face around the world is access to capital. And because we went to a commercial model, we were able to overcome that challenge in a way that otherwise wouldn't be possible. The fact is that no profit and no dividend would not have enabled us to raise $350 million of equity and disburse $3 billion of loans.

DAVIDSON: Yunus, I want to ask you - if all I care about is there's a poor woman in Port au Prince or Nairobi or Hyderabad who I know, if she got a $200 loan, her life could be changed. Here's what I think I'm hearing - is Vikram saying, I can get some money quickly. I can get it to her. I'll make a few bucks, but she'll do what - she'll make a disproportionately larger share of her own income. Mary Ellen's saying, I have a whole host of ways that can - we can do it fast, but the more for-profit it is, the better. And what - I may be mistaken, but what I hear you saying is, slow down, convince the government to dramatically change the laws. Don't go to those investor - go to those investors and say, invest in us, but you won't make any return. We need to convince you that that's a valid way to use your capital. In other words, it might feel, what you're saying, more morally pure, but it also feels a very, very long way away in most countries. Is that fair?

YUNUS: Well, we have gone through that process. The bank didn't come on one day. We could have done a conventional bank ourselves. We'd assisted. We said, we don't want to. You can - you know, we put pressure. So you have to bring your patience into it and passionately pursue that. Suddenly, you - government didn't create my Grameen Bank, microcredit bank. They didn't even understand what this bank is all about. But we had to push, push. We drafted the law and so on. And finally, we got it, got it done.

So if you don't even try, this will never happen. You said, OK, we have the easy solution. You go to the international market or a money market. They bring it, and so this is a solution for the time being looks good. But ultimately, it's not the good solution. Good solution is the one that you become a bank because microcredit is all about banking, not borrowing in the additional market and lending people - to the poor people. That's not banking. Banking is about intermediation. You are moving away from that very concept of microcredit.

DAVIDSON: You know, Chana, I spent a lot of time talking to these guys preparing for the panel and after the panel and on the panel, and I got to say, it is so hard to figure out where to come down on all this. You know, Yunus is suggesting just be patient. Lobby the government, create a new banking system, create really good banking computer systems, and then create all these tiny microbanks all over the world.

JOFFE-WALT: And Vikram is basically saying in response, Yunus' operation worked in Bangladesh, but it won't work anywhere else. Microfinance without money from investors is just too small and grows too slowly, so let's promote lots of for-profit, investor-driven microfinance institutions.

DAVIDSON: And Mary Ellen was probably where I would say the bulk of the policy experts I talked to are, which is somewhere in the middle. I mean, she says, first of all, there are estimates that more than 3 billion poor people in the world would benefit from access to microfinance. And right now, after 30 years of microfinance, there's only about 150 million people in the world who have access to it. So if you do want to ramp things up to reach most of the poor people in the world, then there really is no choice. Microfinance needs access to the massive amounts of capital available from investors. But investors, of course, don't give you their money unless you give them some sort of profit. But, she says, these banks need to be structured and the laws need to be structured in a way that prevents them from just becoming loan shark operations that just siphon money from the poor and give it to the rich.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

JOFFE-WALT: Which brings us back to our question - can greed be used for good? - which is something I know many people have opinions about. We'd love to hear yours.

DAVIDSON: In fact, we set up a discussion page on the internet. We're working with our friends at the Center for Global Development. David Roodman is a microfinance expert there, and he has this great discussion page specifically for us to discuss this particular debate. So we linked to it on our blog, and we'd love you to check it out at npr.org/money.

JOFFE-WALT: It's part of a book that Roodman is writing about microfinance. It's a crowdsourced book. You can read the whole book for free and make comments, or you can just enter the profit debate. Again, it's at npr.org/money.

DAVIDSON: And if you want to hear this whole conversation with Yunus and Vikram and Mary Ellen, we posted the whole thing, including video, on our blog. I'm Adam Davidson.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Thanks for listening.

We estimate that female managers earned 81 cents on the dollar for every dollar
earned by male managers compared to 79 cents in 2000.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Khanna Jaffee.
Well today is Tuesday September 28th and that was director Andrew Sherrill of
the GAO talking about what seems to me like a fairly pathetic narrowing gender
pay gap that you heard at the top of the show. On the podcast today we ask a
fundamental economic question, can good come out of greed? And to look at that
question we have a Nobel Peace Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus. First our Planet
Money Indicator from Jacob Goldstein. Today's Planet Money Indicator is zero
point six percent. That's how much US home prices rose between June and
July of this year. That's from the Case Schiller Index which is probably
the most important measure of home prices in this country. Kind of like
the Dow Jones of home prices. If you will. Alright so this morning I saw this
number housing prices went up 0.6 percent and I swear I had this big
smile on my face because you know Jacob you come on this podcast month
after month, week after week and say how horrible the housing market in the
US is and here is perfect proof 0.6 percent rise in house prices. The
housing market is getting stronger that means maybe the economy is
getting stronger as people are buying houses. They're feeling confident. We're
coming back baby. There is no way you can turn this into your usual bad
news. It is really good news. It's really good news about what housing
prices were doing this spring. It doesn't really tell us anything
about what housing prices are doing right now. The housing numbers we got
today are for July. That's already a few months back. And then on top of
that Case Schiller uses a rolling three-month average. So what that
means is the July numbers are actually an average of May, June and July. So here
we are. It's the end of September and we're seeing numbers influenced by what
was going on all the way back in May. And on top of that in the past few
weeks we've seen all these other housing indicators for July and August
that suggest pretty clearly that there is this glut of unsold homes on
the market and those are likely to be putting downward pressure on house
prices already. So a very long way of saying those monthly gains in the
Case Schiller probably aren't going to continue.
Right. And in fact housing prices could already have begun to fall. We just
won't know it from Case Schiller for a while yet.
Always trusty Goldstein style. You think it's good but I'm actually
going to tell you why it's not.
Makes me a little bit happy.
Thank you Jacob.
Thanks Jacob. Thanks guys.
So I feel like one of the most difficult ideas in capitalism and
capitalist economics is the idea that you might be able to help poor
people more through greed than through charity. You know this is an
idea Adam Smith wrote about in The Wealth of Nations that people seeking
profit will often entirely by accident end up making the world a better
place than people seeking to do good.
You know like profit seeking supermarkets and bakeries end up feeding
a lot more people a lot more efficiently than nonprofit food banks
that kind of thing.
Exactly. So what we're looking at today is what about efforts to
explicitly help the poor. When people try explicitly to help the poor
does that work as well.
And today we're looking at microfinance.
So that's lending small amounts of money to very poor people so they
can start businesses and try to do better for themselves.
Last week I moderated a panel at the Clinton Global Initiative.
That's this annual thing in New York where for three days all these
world leaders and business leaders and nonprofit people from all over
the world get together and talk about and plan how to make the
world a better place.
And the panel I moderated was so interesting.
I found it really powerful and I thought that our listeners would
enjoy it as well.
So we're going to bring you much of that debate today.
Mohammed Younis was there.
He won the Nobel Peace Prize because he is the father of microfinance
one of the biggest revolutions in helping poor people become less
poor. And his view is it is simple.
Greed will not help the poor.
No rich investor should ever make a profit from a business that lends
money to poor people.
Profit seeking he says will always end up hurting the poor.
In the other corner on this panel is Vikram Akula the CEO and founder
of SKS microfinance which is exactly the kind of company Younis hates.
SKS is not only for profit it's now publicly traded on the stock
exchange and it has lots of rich investors making profits by
lending money to very poor people in India.
And Akula who's Indian-American says at first he was like Younis.
He started working for a nonprofit microfinance NGO that lived off tiny
grants instead of investor money and it sucked.
Women from more remote areas would often come and say can you
start in our village and we'd always have to say no.
You know it's it's grant run so we don't have funds and we'd
have to turn them away and they'd walk away disappointed.
Now in one particular day of very poor women emaciated torn
sari no chepals she had clearly walked from quite a distance to
ask me the same question and again I said we don't have funds
we can't come into your village but unlike the other women who
simply walked away disappointed she looked me in the eye and
said something that I'll never forget.
She said am I not poor too.
Do I not deserve a chance to get my family out of poverty.
Now for me this was a jarring question because here I was
thinking I'm doing something to help eradicate poverty but this
woman's question basically put me in my place.
Basically said look what are you doing if you're doing this
only in a handful of villages and not doing it in the next
set of villages it's as if you're sending one child to
school and holding the other one back and that's when I
was so shook up by that question actually left my NGO
and I came up with the idea of using a highly commercial
model so that you could access capital markets and go
back to that woman or any poor woman anywhere in the world
and say yes you too can have an opportunity.
Vikram says that SKS by offering decent profits to
investors has grown insanely fast in a very short amount of
time. It's reached millions of poor people in India who
never would have had access to microloans and he says the
more money his investors make the better his company
does the lower the interest rates he charges to
customers.
Eunice says he doesn't even want to hear about this
business logic because it's just wrong to make money that
way and he knows even if it's helping them now it's
gonna end up hurting the poor.
So what we are opposed to when you say profit or
commercialization it's money of the poor going out to
somebody else and you may say well what what's wrong
with taking a small amount of profit. Then I'll say is
it a small. Who defines that small. How do you do
you have any rule that will keep it restricted to this
percentage. You're not. It's an open thing. So anybody
who makes profit can do that. So today you may say
well we are making only a small profit but tomorrow
because of the system that you have you like to
maximize your profit. It's a wrong direction. That's
all I'm saying. We are not opposed to making
profit only who makes the profit out of the
poor people and how much. That is the issue. If
somebody says oh we are restricted profit area we
take only one percent profit or two percent
profit. I said go right ahead. No problem. But
the moment you say profit the sky is the limit.
OK. And Vickram I think when we look at your
personal biography this is someone who devoted
his career and his training to helping poor
people. If you were trying to become a big
fancy bank CEO you made a terrible series of
career choices. But how do we trust that 10
years from now 40 years from now SKS will
continue to have serving the poor as central
to its mission. The phrase in the literature is
mission drift. And how is it not inevitable that
the pull for profits will you know will outlast
you and will eventually shift away from caring
whether women are the main recipients or
positive uses are made of the loans. We see
at SKS Microfinance no conflict between the
social mission that is our actual mission of
helping to eradicate poverty and the commercial
approach. Now let me explain why this this
makes sense. In a typical financial services
company the idea is you push up loan sizes for
example because that increases your profits.
You raise interest rates to as high as you
can because that increases your profits. At
SKS Microfinance to give you an example our
loan officers are not incentivized on loan
size. Whether our loan officer gives a 40
dollar loan to a woman and we work 100 percent
exclusively with women or a 400 dollar loan
to a woman he gets compensated in exactly the
same way. Now we do that because we want him
to give the right loan amount for the right
individual and not to push out something that
may increase profits but actually may not be
good for her. Likewise when it comes to
interest we could easily increase our interest
rates to a much higher amount and probably not
lose a single customer and extract from them
because in many cases we're in a monopoly
situation. Yet we don't do so. We don't push
out large loan sizes and we don't charge what
the market can bear in terms of interest and
we do that because it's socially in terms of
our mission the right thing to do. Having
said that let me give you the business logic.
The business logic is you create greater
shareholder value not by extracting from
someone when she takes a 40 dollar loan but
rather by as she moves up the economic
ladder and moves to a 400 dollar loan moves
to taking three four different insurance
products five six different credit products
from you. That's when you create greater
shareholder value. So the business logic
actually lands you in exactly the same
place that the social logic does. If the
Grameen or micro credit program is not
owned by the borrowers. My next suggestion
is why don't you make it if it's owned by
somebody else outside the borrowers make it
as a social business. And social business
means we do it to make your available this
loan available to you so that you can
help yourself. We have no intention of
making a penny out of your loan. So it's
very clear upfront. We know that. So the
moment you do the other conventional
business conventional business has its
own logic. No matter what becomes says
today that logic will get him over. He
cannot escape that. Today he is very
nice very frank. He's telling this is
his mission. He is a good person. There's
no problem with that. But he will be
caught up by other interest into it
because others are shareholders now. They
will give you give us the return. Where
is my return coming up? So under that
pressure he'll be gradually moving in.
So all I'm saying it's the wrong
direction. You'll end up in the wrong
target. Now we should note that Eunice
and Grameen Bank you know he's the
guy who's against the kind of for
profit investor driven model. Eunice is
in a very special situation. He and
Grameen Bank don't have to look for
investors to give them capital because
they operate as a real bank as a
micro bank. They go into a new area in
Bangladesh. They open a bank and they
take deposits from the poor villagers
in that community and they use that
money to make loans to other poor
people in that community. And the bank
as a whole is owned by the
villagers. So if there is any profit
it goes back to the villagers. As
opposed to investors. As opposed to
outside rich people investors. Right. The
most microfinance institutions around
the world either can't or choose not to
operate as banks. And a lot of times
because many countries banking laws
make it very difficult to open a bank
focused on poor customers. So instead
microfinance companies take charitable
grants from foundations or
individuals or they go to investors
and use that money to lend to poor
people. Eunice wants all those
microfinance companies all over the
world the nonprofits and the for
profits to just become regular
old fashioned banks. That way poor people
can have savings accounts and not just
loans. No money has to go out to
investors as profits. But the third
panelist on this panel Mary Ellen
Iskandarian with Women's World Banking
says it is not so easy. In most
countries if a microfinance company
wants to become a bank they would
have to lobby the government for new
banking laws because it's basically
illegal for them to become a micro
bank. And also it's really hard to
be a small bank. You need all these
complicated computer systems to keep
track of borrowers and depositors and
that's really really expensive. We're
working with four of our network
members in Colombia the Dominican
Republic Kenya and Pakistan right
now and they're each at varying
stages of the transition from NGO to
regulate an institution. And you
know the one in Colombia McKinsey
comes in and does a study and
tells them you can't afford to
raise deposits from your clientele
until year five. You have to start
going to the middle class and upper
class for deposits. So we're working
very hard to make that possible for
them. But you know I don't think we
should sort of gild a lily here. It
is difficult to convince microfinance
institutions to make that shift to
start taking deposits because it's
very expensive. Now Vikram why didn't
you just become a bank. Well the
reality is that getting a banking
license in India is nearly impossible.
I think what Professor Yunus has
achieved in Bangladesh is quite
remarkable. But it is a slightly unique
situation. It's a special act of
parliament that created a bank that
allowed for deposit taking from
borrowers and it's a remarkable
thing. But the reality is in most
developing countries the central
bank simply does not have that
structure. Certainly not in India and
if we were to lobby for that as we
try and do this is something that
is sort of waiting for Godot. It'll
take a bit of time before that
actually does happen. One of the
challenges that the rest of the
microfinance institutions face around
the world is access to capital and
because we went to a commercial
model we were able to overcome that
challenge in a way that otherwise
wouldn't be possible. The fact is
that no profit no dividend would not
have enabled us to raise three
hundred fifty million dollars of
equity and disperse three billion
dollars of loans. And Yunus I'm
going to ask you if all I care
about is there's a poor woman in
Port-au-Prince or Nairobi or
Hyderabad who I know if she got a
two hundred dollar loan her life
could be changed. Here's what I
think I'm hearing is is Vikram
saying I can get some money
quickly. I can get it to her. I'll
make a few bucks but she'll do
what she'll make a
disproportionately larger share of
her own income. Mary Ellen saying
I have a whole host of ways that
we can do it fast but the more
for-profit it is the better. And
what I may be mistaken but what I
hear you saying is slow down
convince the government to
dramatically change the laws.
Don't go to those investors go
to those investors and say
invest in us but you won't make
any return. We need to convince
you that that's a valid way to
use your capital. In other words
it might feel what you're saying
more morally pure but it also
feels a very very long way away
in most countries. Is that
fair? Well we have gone through
that process. The bank didn't
come on one day. We could have
done a conventional bank
ourselves. We resisted. We
said we don't want to be a
conventional bank. We put
pressure. So you have to bring
your patience into it and
passionately pursue that.
Suddenly the government didn't
create a microcredit bank. They
didn't even understand what
this bank is all about. But we
had to push, push. We drafted
the law and so on and finally
we got it. Got it done. So if
you don't even try this will
never happen. You said okay we
have the easy solution. You
go to the international market
or money market there bring it
and so on. This is a solution
for the time being looks good
but ultimately it's not the
good solution. Good solution
is the one that you become a
bank because microcredit is all
about banking not borrowing
international market and lending
people to the poor people.
That's not banking. Banking is
about intermediation. You are
moving away from the very
concept of microcredit.
You know, I spent a lot of
time talking to these guys
preparing for the panel and
after the panel and on the
panel and I got to say it is
so hard to figure out where
to come down on all this. You
know, Eunice is suggesting
just be patient, lobby the
government, create a new
banking system, create really
good banking computer systems
and then create all these
tiny micro banks all over
the world.
And Vikram is basically saying
in response, Eunice's operation
worked in Bangladesh but it
won't work anywhere else.
Microfinance without money from
investors is just too small
and grows too slowly.
So let's promote lots of
for-profit investor driven
microfinance institutions.
And Mary Ellen was probably
where I would say the bulk
of the policy experts I talk
to are which is somewhere
in the middle. I mean she
says first of all there are
estimates that more than 3
billion poor people in the
world would benefit from
access to microfinance.
And right now after 30
years of microfinance,
there's only about 150
million people in the world
who have access to it.
So if you do want to ramp
things up to reach most of
the poor people in the
world then there really is
no choice.
Microfinance needs access
to the massive amounts of
capital available from
investors but investors of
course don't give you
their money unless you give
them some sort of profit.
But she says these banks
need to be structured and
the laws need to be
structured in a way that
prevents them from just
becoming loan shark
operations that just siphon
money from the poor and
give it to the rich.
Which brings us back to
our question can greed be
used for good.
Which is something I know
many people have opinions
about. We'd love to hear
yours.
In fact we set up a
discussion page on the
internet. We're working
with our friends at the
Center for Global
Development. David Rudman
is a microfinance expert
there and he has this
great discussion page
specifically for us to
discuss this particular
debate. So we link to it
on our blog and we'd
love you to check it
out at NPR.org slash
money.
It's part of a book that
Rudman is writing about
microfinance. It's a
crowd sourced book. You
can read the whole book
for free and make
comments or you can just
enter the profit debate.
Again it's at NPR.org
slash money.
And if you want to hear
this whole conversation
with Eunice and Vikram
and Mary Ellen we
posted the whole thing
including video on our
blog. I'm Adam
Davidson.
And I'm Hannah
Jeffy-Walt. Thanks for
listening.
