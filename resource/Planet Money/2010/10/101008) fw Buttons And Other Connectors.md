The U.S. is the world's biggest manufacturer -- way bigger than China, according to the National Association of Manufacturing. So why doesn't it feel that way? On today's Planet Money, we visit two factories to find out. Music: V.V. Brown's "Quick Fix"

The U.S. is the world's biggest manufacturer — way bigger than China, according to the National Association of Manufacturing. So why doesn't it feel that way?

On today's Planet Money, we visit two factories to find out.

Factory #1

Back in the day, the Buttonwood Corporation ran double shifts at its New York City factory, with 150 machines cranking out tens of thousands of buttons.

These days, Chinese factories not only have cheaper labor, but also newer, fancier machines. Buttonwood — a family business, owned by two brothers — has just one employee left. They sell small orders of wood buttons, and take orders online at woodbuttons.com.

Factory #2

The Zierick Manufacturing Corporation makes products that are all around us, but we never notice: Little pieces of metal that connect electronics components to control panels.

This sounds like the kind of cheap, commodity item that would be made in China. But it isn't; Zierick's factory is in upstate New York.

Zierick's trick is to keep coming up with new, patentable ideas to make connectors better and better. So if you want a really good, reliable, connector, it's worth it to pay more and get one from them.

The company's doing well. They have lots of employees, lots of customers. They just have to keep coming up with new ideas to stay ahead of everybody else.

AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: This is the deepest hole we ever started in in our lifetime, the worst since 1929. And if you start in that deep of a hole, takes a long time to get out.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "QUICK FIX")

VV BROWN: Hey, honey, honey. I'm not looking for a quick fix.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Adam Davidson.

ALEX BLUMBERG, BYLINE: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Today is Friday, October 8. And that was Austan Goolsbee, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, you heard at the top.

DAVIDSON: On today's podcast, the state of American manufacturing. It is not what you think. Well, actually, it's exactly what you think. But it's also really different, all at the same time. We're going to get into that because we're going to bring you inside two factories to see what works and what really, really doesn't when U.S. manufacturers try to compete in a global economy.

BLUMBERG: But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator with His Excellency, Sir J. Julius of Flatbush (ph), Jacob Goldstein.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Today's PLANET MONEY indicator - 74,000. That's how many jobs local governments around the country cut between August and September. The number includes almost 50,000 jobs in education. So that means we're seeing a lot of school teachers' jobs get cut.

BLUMBERG: Now, I saw this report. And though we are cutting school teachers and other government jobs, the private sector added 64,000 jobs between August and September, which - that's not much, considering it's the whole private sector we're talking about here. But still, it's growth, right?

GOLDSTEIN: It is growth. And this is the pattern that we've basically been seeing all year. You have the private sector adding jobs every month, a few jobs. And local governments have pretty consistently been cutting jobs. It's like what we're seeing is this mini recession for local governments that lags behind the broader economy. So if you look back a few years, you see that when private sector jobs were being cut through 2008 and 2009, jobs with local governments were actually holding steady, even climbing here and there. But then in the past year or so, you know, local governments have started to take a big hit to their tax revenues. And what we're seeing now is a response to that. They're cutting workers and trying to balance their budgets.

BLUMBERG: So it's sort of a second wave employment recession in government.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah, at least in local government. And, you know, in magnitude, it is smaller, right? I mean, there were millions and millions of jobs cut through the private sector. So we're not saying, like, this is a whole huge second wave, but it's definitely noticeable, particularly this month.

BLUMBERG: An aftershock.

GOLDSTEIN: It's an aftershock. That's well said.

BLUMBERG: Thanks, Jacob.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

DAVIDSON: So Alex, what comes to mind when I say these words? American manufacturing.

BLUMBERG: Bad stuff. A lot of bad stuff. Unemployment lines, shuttered factories, jobs fleeing to China. You know, I mean, I think everybody has heard American manufacturing is in decline.

DAVIDSON: Well, actually, I have this handy cheat sheet here that provides a slightly different view. This is courtesy of the National Association of Manufacturers. And I got to say before I read this, if someone had asked me who's the top manufacturer in the world? - I would have said, oh, China. No. It's not. The U.S. is the world's No. 1 manufacturer, above China. In fact, the U.S. makes 21% of all manufactured goods worldwide. China is third behind Japan with 12% of manufactured goods.

BLUMBERG: That is really staggering. So first of all, you're saying the U.S. makes one-fifth of every manufactured good in the world and that they also make twice as much stuff as China is making.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Not quite twice, but close.

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

DAVIDSON: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: So why do we always hear that other story in the media and from politicians that manufacturing in the U.S. is dying or even dead?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. So it turns out both stories are true. A lot of U.S. manufacturing is indeed dying. It's in horrible decline. And at the exact same time, U.S. manufacturing, parts of U.S. manufacturing are thriving. We're making more than anyone else in the world, and everyone else is desperately trying to catch up to us. So both stories are true. And to understand this paradox, we are going to go to two factories today. Each factory represents one of these competing stories - one in decline, one doing pretty good. And we're going to try and shed some light on the actual state of American manufacturing.

BLUMBERG: That sounds like a podcast. So where's our first stop?

DAVIDSON: All right, first stop.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)

BLUMBERG: All right. That sounds like a manufacturer. Where are we?

DAVIDSON: All right. This is Brooklyn, N.Y., Buttonwood Corporation. They make wood buttons, you know, like on your shirt or suit if those were wood buttons. They look like plastic buttons...

BLUMBERG: That's right.

DAVIDSON: ...Unlike most people.

BLUMBERG: You have to point that out for all our listeners. Listeners, he's lying. I have wood buttons. I would never wear plastic buttons.

So that's a button machine that we're hearing there?

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And they're actually pretty cool. They just churn out buttons all day long. Or they would if there was a lot of demand for American-made wood buttons, but there isn't. So Buttonwood Corporation's owner, Dennis Hoffman, turned the machine on just for me so that I could record the sound.

BLUMBERG: So this machine wasn't running when you got there?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, no. His machines don't run a lot of the time. Although before we get to now, let's do some history. Dennis Hoffman and his brother Steve own the business now. It was started by their dad and their uncles back in 1939. This was when New York City was the center of global clothing manufacturing. They had this big factory right in the heart of Manhattan.

DENNIS HOFFMAN: You know, it was a good business in the '40s and the '50s. And I came into the business in 1968. And it was a great business. We made buttons that were made from milk out of casein.

DAVIDSON: Really?

HOFFMAN: Yes. And it was - back in the '80s and the '90s, it was a pretty thriving business, casein buttons. And for instance, Ralph Lauren used casein buttons on men's handmade suits that were made out of London years and years ago. And we made the buttons.

DAVIDSON: What was your life like in the '80s?

HOFFMAN: It was nice. You know, beginning of this business, I went away every summer. For four years, I went to Europe by myself for three weeks and traveled around Europe and got to see the countries and this and that and the other. And it was great.

DAVIDSON: To picture Dennis, picture - I don't know - like a big, friendly cop. He gets a smile when he talks about the 1980s. You know, he was single, making good money, spending it on fun. He was the button king of New York. They were getting these crazy orders - 10,000 buttons, 20,000 buttons. They would have to sometimes run two shifts a day, 16 hours, 150 machines turning out dozens of buttons every second just to keep up with the demand.

BLUMBERG: And I think I know how this story goes. As more and more clothing got made in China, Indonesia, Latin America, it makes sense the buttons that fastened that clothing together - they also move abroad, where they can be made cheaper. And Dennis and his factory become less and less busy.

DAVIDSON: Right. They could not compete with the prices coming out of China. The big orders fell away. And every decade since the '60s, they've moved to a smaller place, then a smaller place. They've had to lay people off every time, get rid of some of their machines. Now they don't even have their own factory space. They're renting a corner way in the back of this business that makes scented candles for high-end stores.

BLUMBERG: And this is where you visited them.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, exactly, on the Brooklyn waterfront. There are cardboard boxes piled everywhere. It's really cramped and tiny. They only have one employee left, Nelson Mendoza (ph). And of the original 150 machines, they have, like - I don't know. Maybe there was a dozen left.

HOFFMAN: And this machine is probably 40 years old.

DAVIDSON: Wow.

HOFFMAN: As well as this one and this one and this one and this one.

DAVIDSON: So these machines you bought in the heyday?

HOFFMAN: Yes.

DAVIDSON: So how often are the machines running now? Is it every day or...

HOFFMAN: It's not every day, no. I wish it was every day.

DAVIDSON: It's not every day because the people he sells to now - they buy very few buttons. He's had to find these little niches. And mostly, it's craftspeople who sew and really like wooden buttons for one reason or another.

HOFFMAN: There's a lot of people that do Civil War reenactments, things like that. And apparently, wood is a button that was, you know, used during the Civil War. But it's not regular business.

DAVIDSON: He showed me his current list of orders. He had two - one for 90 bucks, one for 57.

BLUMBERG: Ouch.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And while I was there, the phone rang.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

DAVIDSON: Exciting. I happened to be there when he got an order. It was for 48 Indian beads.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, That's a far cry from Ralph Lauren with 20,000 buttons. And this is a really familiar story, obviously, and it's happening to a lot of manufacturers who make things like buttons, commodities. A button from one factory is pretty much like a button from another factory. So button manufacturers - to succeed, they have to compete, basically, on price.

DAVIDSON: And Dennis explained to me that if you want to make buttons cheaper, if you want to cut down on the manufacturing costs, there's two main ways you can do it. You can do labor, or you can do machinery. So back in the '80s and '90s as China and other low-wage countries started to compete, they had much worse machinery, but they had really, really cheap labor. But Dennis would invest or try to invest in newer, cooler machines that made buttons faster with fewer errors. And while the machines cost a lot, over time, they would make buttons cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.

But now, in the last decade, it's something new. China not only has the cheap labor. They also have the best machines, like these amazing Bonetti machines that come out of Italy. And Dennis can't afford what he's been craving. What do you picture when you picture a Chinese button factory?

HOFFMAN: A hundred Bonetti machines just sitting there, constantly, you know, running 24 hours a day. The new models - the new models with laser eyes, and, you know, if the button's on the wrong side or if the button has a blemish in it or something, it picks it out and knocks it off and so forth and so, I mean, I don't know.

DAVIDSON: Can you make a living now in the way this...

HOFFMAN: Not really, no. It's not easy, you know?

DAVIDSON: Are you losing money?

HOFFMAN: Are we losing money? I don't know.

DAVIDSON: Somewhere between losing and breaking even?

HOFFMAN: Somewhere around there.

DAVIDSON: So why not just give it up?

HOFFMAN: I don't know. It's hard to give it up. It's hard. I mean, I'm not - you know, I'm 63 years old. I'm far from feeling even ready to retire. I mean, it would be nice.

DAVIDSON: What else would you do?

HOFFMAN: Me? I have no idea. Become a waiter. I don't have too much, you know, ambition.

DAVIDSON: I mean, you know buttons.

HOFFMAN: What I'd like to do? I don't know. I'd like to be - I'd like to win that lottery that that girl won the other day, you know? And then I'd be happy.

NELSON MENDOZA: (Inaudible) $22 million.

HOFFMAN: Getting $22 million.

DAVIDSON: So your retirement plan is win the lottery.

HOFFMAN: Right. Would be to win the lottery and - right. I'd be happy. I'd be happy with...

MENDOZA: Without playing the numbers.

HOFFMAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: So you can hear Nelson in the background saying, but you don't even play the numbers. His retirement plan is to win a lottery that he doesn't actually even play.

DAVIDSON: Now, I want to say a few things about Dennis Hoffman quickly. First off, I just am really grateful he was so open and honest with us. Like, weirdly, a lot of manufacturers just wouldn't even return our calls. They wouldn't meet with us. And he really opened his heart to us. It was very cool.

And also, I want to say Dennis says that despite everything we've described, he's happier than he's ever been in his life. And that's because a few years ago, he fell in love with a wonderful woman. He got married for the first time in his 60s. Now, they can't afford to go on vacation. They've never been on a vacation together. They couldn't afford a honeymoon. But he says they really are happy.

BLUMBERG: So I think that's a beautiful lesson for today. American manufacturing. You know, business success is overrated. Love is what's important.

DAVIDSON: No, Alex, that is not the lesson. We're PLANET MONEY. We don't care about love.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Now, I know that you're a big softie inside, and you care a lot about love. But let's break down what the lesson is.

What Buttonwood is facing every American manufacturer is facing. China, other places in Asia, Latin America - they have cheaper labor. They have the same or even newer machines. So how do we compete? How do American manufacturers compete?

DAVIDSON: All right. To answer that question, I think it would be helpful to go to our next factory.

BLUMBERG: Let's do it.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)

BLUMBERG: All right, so where are we now?

DAVIDSON: We're an hour north of Brooklyn in Mount Kisco, N.Y., at Zierick Manufacturing.

BLUMBERG: So you told me this was going to sound really different, but actually, to my ears, it sounds sort of the same as the button factory.

DAVIDSON: All right. I guess because I've been to both places.

BLUMBERG: Right.

DAVIDSON: They're very, very different, you know? Buttons in the corner, very small. Two guys. Zierick is a huge plant. Seventy or so people work there. There's these massive machines just stamping out their little products, one after another after another.

BLUMBERG: And while we're on the subject, what are those products? What do they make here?

DAVIDSON: Actually, I love learning about products like this because I would guess that in your entire life, you are never more than three feet from the kind of product Zierick makes. In fact, I would guess there are dozens of them in this room right now. But I would bet that you have never heard of the product they make. You have never thought about it. And there's a chance you have never seen it.

BLUMBERG: Wow, this is a riddle. All right. What do they make, air?

DAVIDSON: Well, no. You've heard of air.

BLUMBERG: I guess I have heard of air. Some sort of microscopic, flying government spy robots?

DAVIDSON: No, that's a different company that I visited. No. All right.

Here's what Zierick makes. Think about breaking open your TV or this monitor here or your phone and, you know, any electronic thing. And you know how there's that, like, little plastic panel that has all the electronic guts attached to it?

BLUMBERG: Oh, yeah. The control panel. That like, little - like, it's like a circuit board. It's usually green, I think. I think I've seen those. So that's what they make?

DAVIDSON: No, no, no. Far more obscure. All right. So on that circuit board, there's those little electronic things, like a capacitor or a resistor or whatever...

BLUMBERG: Diodes or whatever.

DAVIDSON: Diodes. I don't know what they are. And it's sitting on the plastic panel, and there's this tiny piece of metal that's connecting that electronic thing to the panel.

BLUMBERG: That's what they make?

DAVIDSON: Yes. They make the little metal thing that connects electronics to panels.

BLUMBERG: That is really obscure. So what is that thing called?

DAVIDSON: It's called a connector.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Makes sense. So they're, like, the buttons of the electronics world.

DAVIDSON: You brought it all together.

BLUMBERG: I did.

DAVIDSON: And much like buttons, they're all around us all the time, and we don't really think about them very much.

JANOS LEGRADY: You see, every car has more and more electronic, and there are Zierick connectors in it, for instance, you know?

DAVIDSON: Wait. Every car in America?

LEGRADY: Every U.S.-made car, yes.

DAVIDSON: Has your inventions in it.

LEGRADY: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.

DAVIDSON: That's cool.

LEGRADY: Well, it's a good feeling, you know? It's a good feeling.

DAVIDSON: That's Janos Legrady. He's the head of R&D at Zierick.

BLUMBERG: And a vampire?

DAVIDSON: No, no. He's a U.S. citizen. He's an immigrant from Hungary, came here 40 years ago or so.

BLUMBERG: That was a cheap joke. But OK, but how is this company succeeding? I don't get it. It seems like - aren't connectors just like buttons? Can't China make connectors? It doesn't seem that complicated.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, and China does make lots and lots and lots of connectors, and they make them much more cheaply than Zierick does. But one of the secrets of Zierick's success is that OK, yes, they're in the business of making connectors. But much more than that, they're in the business of innovation, of creating new kinds of connectors, of inventing new products. In fact, Janos says he has a quota. It's his job to come up with at least one new invention, one brand new idea in connector technology at least once a year.

LEGRADY: Sometimes, you just wake up middle of the night, and wow. It is - you know, it's comes to your mind.

BLUMBERG: So wait a minute. How many new ideas in connectors can there be? Once you figured out how to connect one thing to another, isn't the job done?

DAVIDSON: Well, yeah. Like with buttons, sure. I mean, there's new technology in button making, but the button itself, I would guess, probably peaked in its innovation sometime in the 13th century. You know, a button then probably looks an awful lot like a button now.

But that's one of the big differences between the businesses that can succeed in America and those that are in trouble. And I think a good rule of thumb is if your great-grandparents or actually even just your parents can understand the product you make, there's a good chance someone in China is making it a lot cheaper.

BLUMBERG: So OK, fine. But what is new, then, in the connector business?

DAVIDSON: So many things, man. I got to say, Alex, you don't know the first thing about connector technology.

BLUMBERG: Dude, neither did you a week ago.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, well, it's now, baby. I'm an expert now because Janos got me all excited. Actually, he really, really did. It was kind of cool because I learned that the connector business is really dynamic. It's constantly changing, and it's been changing continuously since he first got into the business.

LEGRADY: The most exciting invention, what really put Zierick and me on the map was 20 years ago when we had the Soviet Union and good reliable enemy, and the biggest, most important thing was the supercomputers.

DAVIDSON: And, Jess, can you lower it? Because I'm going to step in here because his inventions are so technical and complicated. I - you can't - actually, no nonexpert can even understand what they do exactly. Even like this. He's talking about his proudest moment, his greatest achievement. And he - I don't understand what it is. It's some - there's these incredibly tiny, wavy tubes made out of gold that create a special kind of strong connection between these two other gold plates. And somehow, this was essential to keeping supercomputers running.

BLUMBERG: Wow. So does anyone use these connectors anymore?

LEGRADY: Well, that's the thing. Everything he invents becomes outdated really quickly, like everything in electronics. Like, have you seen a supercomputer lately?

BLUMBERG: I have one in my pocket. It's called an iPhone.

DAVIDSON: Yeah, that's exactly the point, actually. Because, I mean, just think about that. Think about the connector needs of a giant mainframe versus the connector needs of the iPhone. And he's been through so many revolutions, like the automatic soldering revolution of the 1990s. And lately, there's been the solderless connection revolution.

BLUMBERG: Wow. How did I miss all these revolutions?

DAVIDSON: Well, I think you let your subscription to Connector Magazine lapse.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) That's exactly - I knew I shouldn't have done that. Now, of course, these revolutions are important. When Janos creates a new revolution by creating a new product, he gets that product patented. And for a while, Zierick is the only company that has this brand-new product. They can charge a nice premium for it. They make a nice profit.

DAVIDSON: But they have to get all of that profit really quickly because as soon as a new idea is out there, there's this clock ticking because it's going to become outdated soon, or some company out there will come along and steal the idea.

LEGRADY: It's just question of time before they figure out a way to go around the patents, you know? So...

DAVIDSON: Is that tough? Are you like, (vocalizing)?

LEGRADY: No, it's not tough. It's just question of time, you know? It's really not - we know what's going to happen, so it's happened, you know?

BLUMBERG: And, of course, as soon as someone steals Zierick's idea, Zierick becomes just like the button business. They're just competing on speed and price, and China will win that war. So it's a lot of pressure on Janos to come up with new ideas all the time, right?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, it really is. And he talked about that. But he also says he loves it. It's exciting to have to constantly stay on the edge of the connector technology, although he did say the pace has picked up quite a bit. Back in the '80s and the '90s, he could ride out a good idea for three or four or five years. Now if he doesn't have a good idea at least once a year, Zierick's going to have to let people go. They're going to have to lay off some of their workers. And if he ever had a two- or three-year spell of no new ideas, Zierick might go out of business.

BLUMBERG: All right. But here's this other thing I don't understand. If I go to Zierick, I'd see 70 people working at these big machines. And I'd think, oh, this business is making its money by making stuff, actual things. But you're telling me no. Actually, the thing that's making them money is this one guy and his ideas.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. And he's way in the back in this small office. You probably wouldn't even notice him. And he's going to get mad at me if I don't mention there is a larger engineering team that supports and works with him. But this idea of the one guy in the back having ideas and then that fueling all the profits that allow a manufacturing business to succeed - that really is the new model for U.S. manufacturing. U.S. manufacturers that succeed make things, sure, but they really make their money by coming up with new ideas.

BLUMBERG: So, for example, Apple Computer, Nike - they keep inventing, innovating stuff in-house. But here's what I don't understand. Those companies keep the innovation here in America, but a lot of the manufacturing is done abroad. You know, they invent the stuff here, and then they have it manufactured abroad. Why doesn't Zierick do that?

DAVIDSON: Yeah, I actually talked to the owner of the company, Gretchen Zierick, about that. And she says that would not work for them at all. She's not even considering it. First off, a lot of their customers are here in the U.S. They're large companies that make really high-end stuff - airplanes, medical equipment, military hardware. And Janos is on the phone with them all the time, asking them what connector problems they have. What new ideas would they want to see? So it's really good to have Janos near them. But she also says that workers in America have more education and more skills than most workers in poorer countries. And they make better, more reliable products. Yeah, they cost more. But those big companies that make high-value stuff are willing to pay more for them.

BLUMBERG: But aren't we talking about connectors? I mean, how reliable do they need to be? How much skilled labor do you really need to make a connector?

DAVIDSON: Have you ever screamed at your stupid phone that broke or your TV remote that doesn't work, and there's something rattling inside? There's a decent chance that whatever electronic thing you have that breaks, it broke because they used a cheap, inferior connector.

LEGRADY: I know that connection, interconnection is still the weakest link in electronic assembly. And working on that field, I have a real contribution. You know, I am not doing routine work. It's a significant part, and I enjoy it. You know, I enjoy to come to work. I enjoy to talk to the customers, to the customers, engineers about their problems.

DAVIDSON: So, I mean, I feel like you have made the world a tiny bit more efficient, I guess.

LEGRADY: Yes. I - we can say that.

BLUMBERG: So Adam, I have to say I feel both good and bad about what we learned here, which I guess isn't surprising since we started out saying it's a paradox. I have paradoxical feelings. I feel bad for Dennis, sure, but I feel good to learn that there really is a way for the U.S. to stay competitive in manufacturing, although it seems like the way to do that is to constantly come up with new ideas, constantly be thinking of new ways to do business, constantly staying one step ahead of Chinese and other cheaper, faster global competitors. It's sort of exhausting to think about.

DAVIDSON: Exactly. And all the evidence suggests that this is only going to speed up, you know? Technology, computers make the invention process faster. There's more people all over the world because of globalization trying to solve the same types of problems, so you have more competition. It's easy to imagine that 10 years from now, Janos or whoever succeeds him will have to come up with a new idea, like, every six months or - I don't know - every three weeks.

BLUMBERG: I mean, a new idea every three weeks? Oh, my God.

DAVIDSON: It certainly doesn't work for us here on PLANET MONEY.

BLUMBERG: It does not. All right. Well, I think that does it for us now. On future podcasts, we are going to look into what the government can do about helping U.S. manufacturing. Hint - maybe not much. We will talk about why tariffs and quotas and things that are designed to help manufacturing usually cause more trouble than they're worth.

DAVIDSON: Although, Alex, just quickly, I also want to say that this has made me really want to look into education and immigration. It made me understand how crucial that is to this story. because clearly, for America to succeed, we want a lot more Janoses. And that means everything from better preschool through graduate school education. It means fixing all the problems there. Or maybe it means just importing more and more smart engineers.

BLUMBERG: So the official PLANET MONEY position - massively subsidizing education, cutting all tariffs and opening the borders.

DAVIDSON: I think that's a little too much controversy for right here at the end. We don't have a position. We're going to explore it. We're going to learn more. But later. Right now, you can check out links to Zierick and the buttons and see what we're talking about all at npr.org/money.

BLUMBERG: Send us an email at planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Alex Blumberg.

DAVIDSON: And I'm Adam Davidson. Thank you for listening.

**faster whisper:**
This is the deepest hole we ever started in, in our lifetime. The worst since 1929. And
if you start in that deep of a hole, it takes a long time to get out.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson and I'm Alex Bloomberg. Today
is Friday, October 8th and that was Austin Gouldie, chair of the Council of Economic
Advisers under President Obama. You heard it up on today's podcast, The State of
American Manufacturing. It is not what you think. Well, actually it's exactly what you
think. But it's also really different. All at the same time, we're going to get into
that because we're going to bring you inside two factories to see what works and what
really, really doesn't when U.S. manufacturers try to compete in a global economy.
But first, the Planet Money Indicator with His Excellency, Sir J. Julius of Flatbush,
Jacob Goldstein. Today's Planet Money Indicator, 74,000. That's how many jobs local
governments around the country cut between August and September. The number includes
almost 50,000 jobs in education. So that means we're seeing a lot of school teachers
jobs get cut. And now I saw this report and though we are cutting school teachers
and other government jobs, the private sector added 64,000 jobs between August and
September, which that's not much considering it's the whole private sector we're
talking about here. But still, it's growth, right?
It is growth. And this is the pattern that we've basically been seeing all year.
You have the private sector adding jobs every month, a few jobs, and local
governments have pretty consistently been cutting jobs. It's like what we're
seeing is this mini recession for local governments that lags behind the
broader economy. So if you look back a few years, you see that when
private sector jobs were being cut through 2008 and 2009, jobs with local
governments were actually holding steady, even climbing here and there.
But then in the past year or so, you know, local governments have started to
take a big hit to their tax revenues. And what we're seeing now is a
response to that. They're cutting workers and trying to balance their
budgets. So it's sort of a second wave employment recession in
government. Yeah, at least in local government. And, you know, in
magnitude it is smaller, right? I mean, there were millions and millions of
jobs cut through the private sector. So we're not saying like this is a
whole huge second wave, but it's definitely noticeable, particularly this
month. An aftershock. It's an aftershock. It's well said. Thanks, Jacob.
Thanks, guys. So, Alex, what comes to mind when I say these words?
American manufacturing. Bad stuff. A lot of bad stuff. Unemployment lines,
shattered factories, jobs sling to China. You know, I mean, I think
everybody has heard American manufacturing is in decline. Well,
actually, I have this handy cheat sheet here that provides a slightly
different view. This is courtesy of the National Association of
Manufacturers. And I got to say before I read this, if someone had
asked me who's the top manufacturer in the world, I would have said, Oh,
China. No, it's not. The US is the world's number one manufacturer
above China. In fact, the US makes 21% of all manufactured goods
worldwide. China is third behind Japan with 12% of manufactured goods.
That is really staggering. So first of all, you're saying the US makes
one fifth of every manufactured good in the world, and that they also
make twice as much stuff as China is making. Yeah, not quite twice,
but close. Yeah, exactly. So why do we always hear that other story
in the media and from politicians that manufacturing in the US is
dying or even dead? Yeah. So it turns out both stories are true.
A lot of US manufacturing is indeed dying. It's in horrible decline.
And at the exact same time, US manufacturing, parts of US
manufacturing are thriving. We're making more than anyone else in
the world. And everyone else is desperately trying to catch up to us.
So both stories are true. And to understand this paradox, we are
going to go to two factories today. Each factory represents one of
these competing stories, one in decline, one doing pretty good.
And we're going to try and shed some light on the actual state of
American manufacturing. That sounds like a podcast. So where's our
where's our first stop? All right, first stop.
All right. That sounds like a manufacturer. Where are we? All
right. This is Brooklyn, New York, Buttonwood Corporation. They
make wood buttons, you know, like your shirt or suit. If those
were wood buttons, you'd have plastic buttons. That's right.
You have to point that out for all listeners. Listeners,
he's lying. I have wood buttons. I would never wear plastic
buttons. So that's a button machine that we're hearing there?
Yeah, and they're actually pretty cool. They just churn out
buttons all day long, or they would if there was a lot of
demand for American made wood buttons. But there isn't. So
Buttonwood Corporation's owner, Dennis Hoffman, turned the
machine on just for me so that I could record the sound.
Oh, so this machine wasn't running when you got there?
Yeah, no, his machines don't run a lot of the time.
Although before we get to now, let's let's do some
history. Dennis Hoffman and his brother Steve own the
business now. It was started by their dad and their
uncles back in 1939. This was when New York City was the
center of global clothing manufacturing. They had this
big factory right in the heart of Manhattan.
You know, it was a good business in the 40s and the
50s. And I came into the business in 1968. And it was
a great business. We made buttons that were made from
milk out of casein.
Really?
Yes. And it was back in the 80s and the 90s. It was a pretty
thriving business, casein buttons. And for instance,
Ralph Lauren used casein buttons on men's handmade
suits that were made out of London years and years ago.
And we made the buttons.
And what was your life like in the 80s?
It was nice, you know, getting of this business. I
went away every summer for four years. I went to
Europe by myself for three weeks and traveled around
Europe and got to see the countries and this and that.
And it was great.
To picture Dennis, picture, I don't know, like a
big friendly cop. He gets a smile when he talks about
the 1980s. You know, he was single, making good
money, spending it on fun. He was the button king of
New York. They were getting these crazy orders,
10,000 buttons, 20,000 buttons. They would have to
sometimes run two shifts a day, 16 hours, 150
machines turning out dozens of buttons every second
just to keep up with the demand.
And I think I know how this story goes. As
more and more clothing got made in China,
Indonesia, Latin America, it makes sense. The
buttons that fasten that clothing together, they
also move abroad where they can be made cheaper.
And Dennis and his factory become less and less
busy.
Right. They could not compete with the prices
coming out of China. The big orders fell away.
And every decade since the 60s, they've moved to
a smaller place than a smaller place. They've
had to lay people off every time, get rid of
some of their machines. Now they don't even
have their own factory space. They're renting
a corner way in the back of this business
that makes scented candles for high end stores.
This is where you visited them. Yeah, exactly.
On the Brooklyn waterfront, there are cardboard
boxes piled everywhere. It's really cramped and
tiny. They only have one employee left,
Nelson Mendoza. And of the original 150
machines, they have, like, I don't know,
maybe there was a dozen left.
And this machine is probably 40 years old,
as well as this one and this one.
So these machines you bought in the heyday.
Yeah. So how often are the machines running
now? Is it every day or? It's not every day
now. I wish it was every day. It's not every
day because the people he sells to now,
they buy very few buttons. He's had to find
these little niches. Mostly it's crafts
people who sew and really like wooden
buttons for one reason or another. There's
a lot of people that do civil war
reenactment, things like that. And
apparently wood is a button that was
used during the Civil War. But it's not
regular business. He showed me his
current list of orders. He had two,
one for 90 bucks, one for 57. Yeah.
And while I was there, the phone rang.
Exciting. I happened to be there when
he got an order. It was for 48 Indian
beads. Yeah, that's a far cry from
Ralph Lauren with 20,000 buttons. And
this is a really familiar story,
obviously. And it's happening to a lot
of manufacturers who make things like
buttons, commodities. A button from
one factory is pretty much like a
button from another factory. So button
manufacturers to succeed, they have to
compete basically on price. And Dennis
explained to me that if you want to
make buttons cheaper, if you want to
cut down on the manufacturing costs,
there's two main ways you can do it.
You can do labor or you can do
machinery. So back in the 80s and 90s,
as China and other low-age countries
started to compete, they had much
worse machinery, but they had really,
really cheap labor. But Dennis would
invest or try to invest in newer,
cooler machines that made buttons
faster with fewer errors. And while
the machines cost a lot over time,
they would make buttons cheaper and
cheaper and cheaper. But now in the
last decade, it's something new. China
not only has the cheap labor, they
also have the best machines like
these amazing Benetti machines that
come out of Italy and Dennis can't afford,
but he's been craving. What do you
picture when you picture a Chinese
button factory?
A hundred Benetti machines just sitting
there constantly, you know, running
24 hours a day. New models, a new
model with laser eyes and the
buttons on the wrong side or the
button has a blemish in it or something.
It picks it out and knocks it off and
so forth.
Can you make a living now in the way
it is?
Not really, no. It's not easy, you
know.
Are you losing money?
Are we losing money?
I don't know.
Somewhere between losing and breaking
even?
Somewhere around there.
So why not just give it up?
I don't know. It's hard to give it up.
It's hard.
I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm
I'm 63 years old.
I'm far from feeling even ready to
retire.
I mean, it would be nice.
What else would you do?
Me?
I have no idea.
Become a waiter.
I don't have too much ambition.
I mean, you know, buttons.
What I'd like to do?
I'd like to be
I'd like to win that lottery that
that girl won the other day, you
know, and then I'd be happy.
So your retirement plan is win the
lottery.
Right.
We'll be the one to lottery.
Right.
I'd be happy.
I'd be happy with.
So you can hear Nelson in the
background saying, but you don't even
play the numbers.
His retirement plan is to win a
lottery that he doesn't actually
even play.
Now, I want to say a few things
about Dennis Hoffman quickly.
First off, I just am really
grateful. He was so open and
honest with us.
Like, weirdly, a lot of
manufacturers just wouldn't even
return our calls.
They wouldn't meet with us.
And he really opened his heart
to us.
It was very cool.
And also, I want to say
Dennis says that despite
everything we've described, he's
happier than he's ever been in
his life.
And that's because a few years
ago he fell in love with a
wonderful woman.
He got married for the first
time in his 60s.
Now they can't afford to go on
vacation.
They've never been on a
vacation together.
They couldn't afford a
honeymoon.
But he says they really are
happy.
So I think that's a beautiful
lesson for today.
American manufacturing, you
know, business success is
overrated.
Love is what's important.
No, Alex, that is not
the lesson.
We're planet money.
We don't care about love.
Now, I know that you're a big
softy inside and you care a
lot about love.
But let's break down what
the lesson is.
What buttonwood is facing
every American manufacturer is
facing.
China, other places in Asia,
Latin America, they have
cheaper labor.
They have the same or even
newer machines.
So how do we compete?
How do American
manufacturers compete?
All right. To answer that
question, I think it'd be
helpful to go to our next
factory.
Let's do it.
All right. So where are we
now?
We're an hour north of
Brooklyn in Mount Kisco,
New York, at Xeric
Manufacturing.
So you told me this was
going to sound really
different, but actually to
my ears, it sounds sort of
the same as the button
factory.
All right. I guess because
I've been to both
places, they're very, very
different, you know.
Buttons in the corner,
very small, two guys.
Xeric is a huge plant.
Seventy or so people
work there.
There's these massive
machines just stamping out
their little products one
after another after
another.
And while we're on the
subject, what are those
products? What do they make
here?
Actually, I love learning
about products like this
because I would guess that
in your entire life, you
are never more than three
feet from the kind of
products here it makes.
In fact, I would guess
there are dozens of
them in this room right
now, but I would bet that
you have never heard of
the product they make.
You have never thought
about it, and there's a
chance you have never seen
it.
Wow. This is a riddle.
All right. What do they
make? Air?
Well, no, you've heard
of air.
I guess I haven't heard
of air. Some sort of
microscopic, flying
government spy robots.
No, that's a different
company that I visited.
No. All right.
Here's what Zirk makes.
Think about breaking open
your TV or this monitor
here or your phone
and any electronic
thing. And you know how
there's that little
plastic panel that has
all the electronic guts
attached to it?
Oh, yeah. The control
panel, that little like
it's like a circuit board.
It's usually green, I
think. I think I've seen
those. So that's what
they make?
No, no, no.
Far more obscure.
All right. So on that
circuit board, there's
those little electronic
things like a capacitor
or resistor or
diodes. I don't know
what they are. And it's
sitting on the plastic
panel. And there's this
tiny piece of metal
that's connecting that
electronic thing to the
panel.
That's what they make?
Yes. They make the
little metal thing that
connects electronics to
panels.
That is really obscure.
So what is that thing
called?
It's called a connector.
Makes sense.
So they're they're like
the buttons of the
electronics world.
Ah, you brought it all
together and much like
buttons. They're all
around us all the time
and we don't really
think about them very
much.
You see every car, every
car has more and more
electronic and then
there are Zürich
connectors in it, for
instance, you know.
Wait, every car in
America?
Every U.S. made car.
Yes.
Has your inventions in
it?
Yes. Yeah, yeah, that's
that's correct.
That's cool.
Well,
it's a good feeling, you
know, it's a good
feeling.
That's Janos Legadi.
He's the head of R&D at
Zürich.
And a vampire?
No, he's a U.S. citizen.
He's an immigrant from
Hungary, came here 40
years ago or so.
That was a cheap joke.
But OK, but how is
this company succeeding?
I don't get it.
It seems like aren't
connectors just like
buttons? Can't China
make connectors?
It doesn't seem that
complicated.
Yeah, and China does
make lots and lots and
lots of connectors and
they make them much
more cheaply than
Zürich does.
But one of the secrets
of Zürich success is
that OK, yes, they're
in the business of
making connectors.
But much more than
that, they're in the
business of innovation,
of creating new kinds
of connectors, of
inventing new products.
In fact, Janos says
he has a quota.
It's his job to come
up with at least one
new invention, one
brand new idea and
connector technology at
least once a year.
Sometimes you just
wake up in the middle of
the night and wow,
it comes to your mind.
So wait a minute, how
many new ideas and
connectors can there be
once you've figured out
how to connect one
thing to another?
Isn't the job done?
Well, yeah, like with
buttons, sure.
I mean, there's new
technology in button
making, but the
button itself, I would
guess, probably peaked
in its innovation
sometime in the 13th
century. You know, a
button then probably
looks an awful lot
like a button now.
But that's one of the
big differences between
the businesses that can
succeed in America and
those that are in
trouble. And I think
a good rule of thumb
is if your great
grandparents or actually
even just your parents
can understand the
product you make,
there's a good chance
someone in China is
making it a lot cheaper.
So, OK, fine.
But what is new then
in the connector
business?
So many things, man.
I got to say, Alex,
you don't know the
first thing about
connector technology.
Dude, neither did you
a week ago.
Yeah, well, it's now,
baby. I'm an expert
now because Janos got
me all excited.
Actually, he really,
really did.
It was kind of cool
because I learned that
the connector business
is really dynamic.
It's constantly changing
and has been changing
continuously since he
first got into the business.
The most exciting
invention, what really
put Zurich and me on
the map was 20 years
ago when we had
the Soviet Union
and a good reliable
enemy. And the biggest,
most important thing
was the supercomputers.
And Jess, can you lower it?
Because I'm going to
step in here because
his inventions are so
technical and complicated.
You can't actually know
a non-expert can even
understand what they do
exactly, even like this.
He's talking about
his proudest moment,
his greatest achievement.
And I don't understand
what it is.
It's some, there's
these incredibly tiny
wavy tubes made out
of gold that create
a special kind of
strong connection
between these two
other gold plates.
And somehow this was
essential to keeping
supercomputers running.
Wow. Wow.
So does anyone use
these connectors anymore?
Well, that's the thing.
Everything he invents
becomes outdated
really quickly,
like everything
in electronics.
Like, have you seen
a supercomputer lately?
I have one in my pocket.
It's called an iPhone.
Yeah, that's exactly
the point, actually,
because I mean,
just think about that.
Think about the connector
needs of a giant main frame
versus the connector
needs of the iPhone.
And he's been through
so many revolutions,
like the automatic
soldering revolution
of the 1990s.
And lately there's been
the solderless
connection revolution.
Wow.
How did I miss
all these revolutions?
I think you let your
subscription to
Connector Magazine
laugh.
That's exactly.
I knew I shouldn't
have done that.
Now, of course,
these revolutions
are important when
Janusz creates
a new revolution
by creating a new product.
He gets that product
patented.
And for a while,
Zirik is the only company
that has this
brand new product.
They can charge
a nice premium for it.
They make a nice profit.
But they have to get
all of that profit
really quickly,
because as soon as
a new idea is out there,
there's this clock ticking
because it's going to
become outdated soon
or some company out there
will come along
and steal the idea.
It's just a question of time
before they figure out
a way to go around
the patents, you know, so.
Is that tough?
Are you like, oh, no,
it's not tough.
It's just a question of time.
You know, it's really not.
We know it's going to happen.
So it's happened, you know.
And of course,
as soon as someone steals
Zirik's idea,
Zirik becomes just like
the button business.
They're just competing
on speed and price
and China will win that war.
So it's a lot of pressure
on Janusz to come up
with new ideas all the time, right?
Yeah, it really is.
And he talked about that.
But he also says he loves it.
It's exciting to have to
constantly stay on the edge
of the connector technology,
although he did say
the pace has picked up
quite a bit back in the 80s
and the 90s.
He could ride out a good idea
for three or four or five years.
Now, if he doesn't have a good idea
at least once a year,
Zirik is going to have to
let people go.
They're going to have to
lay off some of their workers.
And if he ever had a two
or three year spell
of no new ideas,
Zirik might go out of business.
All right.
But here's this other thing
I don't understand.
If I go to Zirik,
I'd see 70 people
working at these big machines
and I'd think, oh,
this business is making its money
by making stuff, actual things.
But you're telling me, no,
actually, the thing
that's making the money
is this one guy and his ideas.
Yeah.
And he's way in the back
in this small office.
You probably wouldn't even notice him.
And he's going to get mad at me
if I don't mention
there is a larger engineering team
that supports and works with him.
But this idea of the one guy
in the back having ideas
and then that fueling
all the profits that allow
a manufacturing business to succeed,
that really is the new model
for U.S. manufacturing.
U.S. manufacturers that succeed
make things short,
but they really make their money
by coming up with new ideas.
So, for example, Apple Computer, Nike,
they keep inventing
innovating stuff in-house.
But here's what I don't understand.
Those companies keep the innovation
here in America,
but a lot of the manufacturing
is done abroad.
You know, they invent the stuff here
and then they have it
manufactured abroad.
Why doesn't Zurich do that?
Yeah, I actually talked
to the owner of the company,
Gretchen Zurich, about that.
And she says that would not work
for them at all.
She's not even considering it.
First off, a lot of their customers
are here in the U.S.
They're large companies
that make really high end stuff.
Airplanes, medical equipment,
military hardware.
And Janusz is on the phone
with them all the time
asking them what connector
problems they have,
what new ideas would they want to see.
So it's really good
to have Janusz near them.
But she also says
that workers in America
have more education
and more skills than most workers
in poorer countries.
And they make better,
more reliable products.
Yeah, they cost more.
But those big companies
that make high value stuff
are willing to pay more for them.
But aren't we talking about connectors?
I mean, how reliable
do they need to be?
How much skilled labor
do you really need to make a connector?
Have you ever screamed
at your stupid phone
that broke or your TV remote
that doesn't work
and there's something rattling inside?
There's a decent chance
that whatever electronic thing
you have that breaks,
it broke because they used
a cheap inferior connector.
I know that that
connection, interconnection
is still the weakest link.
In an electronic assembly
and working on that field,
I have a real contribution.
You know, I
not doing a routine work.
This is a significant part
and I enjoy it.
You know, I enjoy to come to work.
I enjoy to talk to the customers,
to the customers,
engineers about their problems.
So, I mean, I feel like you have made
the world a tiny bit more
efficient, I guess.
Yes, we can say that.
So, Adam, I have to say
I feel both good and bad
about what we learned here,
which I guess isn't surprising
since we started out saying
it's a paradox.
I have paradoxical feelings.
I feel bad for Dennis, sure,
but I feel good to learn
that there really is a way
for the U.S.
to stay competitive
in manufacturing.
Although it seems like the way
to do that is to constantly
come up with new ideas,
constantly be thinking
of new ways to do business,
constantly staying
one step ahead of Chinese
and other cheaper,
faster global competitors.
It's sort of exhausting
to think about.
Exactly.
And all the evidence suggests
that this is only going
to speed up, you know,
technology, computers
make the invention process faster.
There's more people
all over the world
because of globalization
trying to solve
the same types of problems.
So you have more competition.
It's easy to imagine
that 10 years from now,
Janos or whoever succeeds him
will have to come up
with a new idea
like every six months
or, I don't know,
every three weeks.
I mean, a new idea
every three weeks.
Oh, my God.
It certainly doesn't work for us.
It does not.
All right.
Well, I think that does it
for us now.
On future podcasts,
we are going to look into
what the government can do
about helping U.S. manufacturing.
Hint, maybe not much.
We will talk about
why tariffs and quotas
and things that are designed
to help manufacturing
usually cause more trouble
than they're worth.
Although, Alex, just quickly,
I also want to say that
this has made me really
want to look into education
and immigration.
It made me understand
how crucial that is
to this story,
because clearly for America
to succeed, we want
a lot more Janosh's.
And that means
everything from better preschool
through graduate school education.
It means fixing
all the problems there.
Or maybe it means
just importing more
and more smart engineers.
So the official
planet money position,
massively subsidizing education,
cutting all tariffs
and opening the borders.
I think that's a little
too much controversy
for right here at the end.
We don't have a position.
We're going to explore it.
We're going to learn more.
But later, right now,
you can check out links
to Zurich and the buttons,
see what we're talking about
all at npr.org money.
Send us an email at
planet money at npr.org.
I'm Alex Bloomberg
and I'm Adam Davidson.
Thank you for listening.
Here for me.
Hey, sweetie, sweetie,
do you think you can control me?
