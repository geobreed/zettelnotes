We dive into the SEC's lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, and Goldman's emphatic arguments in its defense. We consider the similarities between this case and that Magnetar story that aired recently on This American Life. And our long quest to unite financial reporting with Broadway theater continues. (Spoiler: It's a dramatic reading of a Goldman executive's convoluted answer to a key question about the case.) For more, listen to a recording of the conference call Goldman hosted this morning, and read our posts explaining the SEC's case and hashing out one piece of Goldman's defense. You can also read the SEC's complaint and Goldman's response.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS DODD: Obviously, the events of the last week or so, including a major investment firm in New York, without getting into the decision, a legal matter, that there be no doubt in my mind, our bill would have prevented that kind of events from happening, in my view. And that's what the public needs to know.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME")

THE RACONTEURS: (Singing) You don't understand me.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, HOST:

And I'm Jacob Goldstein. Today is Tuesday, April 20. And that was Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd you heard at the top, talking about the Senate's Financial Regulations Bill.

BLUMBERG: Welcome, Jacob. It's good to have you behind the microphone and away from - out of the blog cave.

GOLDSTEIN: I'm glad to be here, Alex. I'm glad to hear I won't be sent back to the blog cave.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Exactly. You're here to stay for today's podcast.

GOLDSTEIN: Real excited.

BLUMBERG: Which is a good one. On the program today, did Goldman Sachs defraud its customers? And we will continue on our quest to bring a little bit of Broadway to financial reporting. But first, Jacob, you want to start us off with the indicator?

GOLDSTEIN: Today's indicator, Alex, $3.5 billion.

BLUMBERG: I know what that figure is. It's been all over the news today.

GOLDSTEIN: It's been all over the news today. It's how much profit Goldman made in the first quarter of 2010. It's a number that was a lot higher than analysts were expecting.

BLUMBERG: Now, this might be the first time in history where a financial company's executives were actually a little bit bummed about good earnings because, you know, this earnings news comes on the heels of revelations last Friday that the SEC had sued Goldman Sachs for fraud, saying that they violated securities law.

GOLDSTEIN: I'm not sure Goldman's execs were bummed about a $3.5 billion problem.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Right. Maybe not. It's just bad optics, as they say on Wall Street. One day, you're getting sued for fraud; the next day, you're making unexpectedly huge profits. It doesn't look good.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. So today on the show, we're going to talk about the charges against Goldman. And we're also going to talk about that big PLANET MONEY story on "This American Life" recently about the hedge fund, Magnetar, which was working with other Wall Street banks, doing very similar transactions to the transaction that the SEC is suing Goldman over.

BLUMBERG: And you have been following these events very closely. You've been following the SEC's case. And so, Jacob, could you just break it down for us? According to the SEC, how did Goldman defraud its clients?

GOLDSTEIN: So the SEC, they really set this up like a story in the complaint they filed against Goldman. It starts with a hedge fund called Paulson & Co. Paulson & Co. wants to bet against the housing market. One way to do that is with something called a synthetic CDO. So Paulson goes to Goldman and says, can you help us create this thing, create this synthetic CDO? Now, in order to create a synthetic CDO, you not only need somebody betting against the housing market; you need somebody to bet on the housing market. Now, according to the SEC, Goldman says, well, yeah, we can help you create this thing. But, you know, if we tell the whole world, well, we created this thing because some hedge fund came to us and wanted to bet against it, no one's going to want to invest in it.

BLUMBERG: No one's going to want to take the other side of that bet and say, we will bet on the housing market, if they know that hedge fund - this hedge fund, Paulson & Co., had come to Goldman Sachs and said, create this for me.

GOLDSTEIN: Exactly. So what Goldman Sachs does is it goes to this company called ACA. ACA is in the business of putting together these CDOs.

BLUMBERG: They're called CDO manager - they're a CDO manager.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And Goldman basically hires ACA to put this CDO together. ACA puts it together. Paulson bets against it. Other investors bet on it. The CDO blows up. Paulson makes a lot of money. The other investors lose a lot of money.

BLUMBERG: So is that the fraud, that this thing just blew up?

GOLDSTEIN: It's not the fraud.

BLUMBERG: OK (laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: In fact, it's going to take us a while to get to the fraud.

BLUMBERG: OK. There's still more to the story.

GOLDSTEIN: So they're actually, so far, so good, according to the SEC.

BLUMBERG: OK.

GOLDSTEIN: So the thing is, this hedge fund - which is, you know, run by this guy, John Paulson, who became famous for betting against the housing market and making a ton of money. So according to the SEC, Paulson, he didn't just bet against this CDO; he actually helped build it.

BLUMBERG: And that's a big deal, right?

GOLDSTEIN: Well, yeah, certainly according to the SEC is - it is. I mean, it's really central to the SEC's case. The SEC is saying, look; this guy, this hedge fund, had a lot of input into what went into the CDO. Presumably, if the hedge fund is betting against it, they're going to want to put really risky stuff in it.

BLUMBERG: But even though this is a big deal, it still actually doesn't get to the fraud, right?

GOLDSTEIN: Right. But I can tell you, we're there. I'm going to get...

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) We're almost at the fraud. OK.

GOLDSTEIN: ...You there right now. So here's the fraud, according to the SEC. The SEC says Goldman should have told investors about Paulson's role in building this thing, but Goldman didn't do that.

BLUMBERG: So Paulson comes to Goldman saying, I need a way to bet against the housing market. Goldman says sure, hires ACA to build a CDO, which Paulson can use as a vehicle for betting against the housing market. And then Goldman has to go out and find people who want to bet on the housing market - essentially, to take the other side of Paulson's bet. And that part, the finding of the other people to take the other side of Paulson's bet, that is where the SEC says the fraud was.

GOLDSTEIN: Yeah. The SEC says Goldman had a responsibility to tell people who are buying this thing that Paulson played a significant role in putting it together. And by failing to tell investors about Paulson's role, the SEC says Goldman defrauded those investors.

BLUMBERG: Now, this SEC case reminded a lot of us around here about the story that I recently did on "This American Life." It was a PLANET MONEY story on "This American Life." It aired about a week ago on the "This American Life" episode called "Inside Job." And I reported that story with two investigative reporters from the outfit ProPublica, which is a nonprofit investigative reporting group. The two reporters were Jake Bernstein and Jesse Eisinger. And in that story, we talked about a hedge fund that seemed to be doing very similar things to what Paulson was doing. And we also talked about some other Wall Street banks that seem to be doing very similar things to what the SEC says Goldman was doing.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. The hedge fund had that name that stuck in my head, Magnetar.

BLUMBERG: Right. It was a story about Magnetar. And Magnetar was asking Wall Street banks to create CDOs that it then bet against, similar to what Paulson did. And in the story that we did on "This American Life," we compared sort of what they were doing to the plot of "The Producers" - you know, that Mel Brooks movie and musical. Magnetar, the hedge fund, in cooperation with Wall Street banks, was putting on a play that they wanted to flop because they'd make more money if it failed than if it succeeded.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And of course, the "This American Life" piece took that idea and ran with it. There's the whole Broadway show tune about this whole story that - you can listen to that on thisamericanlife.org. You can read the print version of the story at propublica.org.

BLUMBERG: So Adam Davidson and I called up one of the reporters that we worked with on that story, Jake Bernstein. He's at ProPublica. And he's been following the SEC's investigation very closely. And we asked him, you know, what Paulson was doing with Goldman, how close was that to what Magnetar was doing with the Wall Street firms that it was working with?

JAKE BERNSTEIN: The similarities are that in the case of the Goldman-Paulson deal, John Paulson is - you know, he has influence on the deal, what kinds of assets go into the deal. You know, he's at the table making those kinds of decisions or helping to make those kinds of decisions, it appears. And then he's betting against that deal. So certainly, our reporting has indicated, you know, that Magnetar had some influence in what these deals looked like. And they also, in many cases, bet against the very same deals.

BLUMBERG: So they - so Magnetar was sort of filling the same function as Paulson.

BERNSTEIN: Exactly.

BLUMBERG: So in the Goldman case, it was Paulson. In the - in our reporting, it was Magnetar. They were the...

BERNSTEIN: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...Same role.

BERNSTEIN: But there's a key difference here. It appears from reading the SEC complaint that Paulson was just short ABACUS. He did not actually...

ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE: You mean he only bet against it.

BERNSTEIN: He only bet against ABACUS. He didn't actually buy any equity or be on the other side of that deal in any way.

DAVIDSON: Now, Magnetar's argument has always been, hey, we were long - meaning we believed in these CDOs that were being created with our encouragement, but we shorted them just in case we had a hedge - we had an insurance policy just in case they went bad. Paulson could not make that argument.

BERNSTEIN: Right. Paulson is - it's a one-directional bet, it appears. He's betting against - you know, he basically went to Goldman and said, you know, I want to bet against this stuff. I don't believe in it. And they helped him construct the deal.

BLUMBERG: So, Jake, it seems like for the SEC to make its case, it comes down to the same issue in both of these examples, both the Magnetar case and the Goldman case, which is there's a concept of materiality. The investment bank has to disclose everything that will be of material interest to a potential investor so that the investor is fully informed about - when they make their investment decision. And in this case, the SEC is essentially arguing it was material for other investors to know that Paulson had come to us and asked us to create the CDO. And if they had known that...

DAVIDSON: For the purposes of shorting it.

BLUMBERG: For the purposes of shorting that. And if they had known that, then perhaps investors would have thought twice about buying into this investment. And that is the same situation that we raised in the Magnetar story. I'm going to just play a quick little clip from that. Here's you and Jesse talking about this.

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, "THIS AMERICAN LIFE")

JESSE EISINGER: So if the investment bank came to an investor and said, we have got an investment for you; a hedge fund actually asked us to create it, and they asked us to put riskier assets into the deal, and oh, by the way, they're betting against it - would you like to buy it? And the answer is going to be obvious. They're not going to do it.

BERNSTEIN: The role of Magnetar, both as equity investor and in their bets against the very CDOs they helped create, were not disclosed in any way to investors in the written documents about the deals - not the marketing material, not the prospectuses, not in the hundreds of pages that an investor could get to see information about the deal - was it disclosed? - that it was, in fact, Magnetar who had helped create the deal and who bet against it.

I mean, it's the same kinds of disclosure issues. You know, what did the investment banks have to tell investors about the nature of these deals? And it's one of those issues that is, frankly, a little gray and a little muddy.

BLUMBERG: So, Jacob, let's just dive into the gray mud here (laughter). Goldman denies the charges that the SEC has leveled against it, right?

GOLDSTEIN: Goldman is, you know, mounting a vigorous defense, and they're making a few arguments. One is that, look; there is this company, ACA. ACA got paid to choose what assets went into the CDO. It was their responsibility. They made the call. And Goldman told investors ACA is the company that decided what went into this.

BLUMBERG: So even if Paulson had suggested whatever, you know, he wanted to go into these CDOs, it doesn't matter, that it's ACA's job to judge that and to put them in or not put them in if it sees fit.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. Goldman's saying, look; ACA was there. It wasn't our - it wasn't Goldman's responsibility to tell investors, you know, Paulson said this. Paulson said that. It's ACA's call, and we're telling everybody that it was ACA's call. And this is what ACA does. This is what this company does. Goldman also makes another argument. They say, look; we also told all the investors in this thing what the underlying assets were, how it was going to be put together. You know, the investors - which were big banks, not mom and pop - had all the information they needed, all the savvy they needed, to decide whether or not to put their money into this thing or not.

BLUMBERG: And now what's interesting is, so far, what we're talking about, there's actually no disagreement about the facts, right?

GOLDSTEIN: That's exactly right. They agree on the same set of facts, right?

BLUMBERG: SEC and Goldman.

GOLDSTEIN: Right. They - you know, the whole story so far is basically the same story. And it's just the SEC saying, well, Goldman, given this story, you have this responsibility to tell investors, hey, Paulson gave this input. And Goldman is saying, no, given this whole story, we don't have that responsibility. It was ACA's call.

BLUMBERG: It all comes down to that issue that was - we just heard about, materiality.

GOLDSTEIN: That's right. Now, there is one detail where the SEC and Goldman do seem to disagree on the facts.

BLUMBERG: Now, I've heard you talking about this detail. You feel like this detail could possibly end up being important?

GOLDSTEIN: It certainly really caught my attention today. I wrote about it this morning on the blog. And I'm really interested. I'm really curious what the answer is going to be.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) OK.

GOLDSTEIN: So this is basically the deal. The SEC - in addition to everything we've been talking about, the SEC also says that Goldman actually misled ACA into thinking that Paulson was betting on the CDO instead of betting against it. So in Wall Street lingo, they led ACA to believe that Paulson was long, meaning betting that housing prices would, you know, stay high or keep going up, rather than telling ACA that Paulson was short, betting against the CDO, betting that housing prices will fall.

BLUMBERG: And in a statement Goldman Sachs made last Friday, they flatly denied this. They said - and I'm quoting - "Goldman Sachs never represented to ACA that Paulson was going to be a long investor."

GOLDSTEIN: Cut to this morning when I'm listening to Goldman Sachs' conference call.

BLUMBERG: And it was this - this was the call where they announced the incredible profits that they made.

GOLDSTEIN: That's right. But the incredible profits notwithstanding, all the Wall Street analysts who listen and ask questions on these calls actually seemed more interested in the SEC lawsuit than in Goldman's blockbuster profits, which was nice for me because, also, I was, frankly, a little bit more interested in the lawsuit.

BLUMBERG: Right.

GOLDSTEIN: So then this one analyst asked about that denial that Goldman issued on Friday and that we're talking about. And the way this Goldman exec on the call answered that question was really convoluted, you know, and not so much like that very crisp, clear denial that we had last week.

BLUMBERG: And in fact, we've been listening to this exchange over and over here at PLANET MONEY. There's a lot of long pauses and tortured syntax and fumbling. You can almost imagine the lawyer and the executive sort of pressing mute and whispering back and forth and then coming back on the call.

GOLDSTEIN: Unfortunately, we can't play the tape. We asked Goldman for permission, but we didn't hear back. You can hear it if you want to online. I'll post a link from the blog.

BLUMBERG: Npr.org/money.

GOLDSTEIN: Thank you. And as a special service to our podcast listeners, we got an actor to read this one particular exchange.

BLUMBERG: And now, PLANET MONEY regulars might know when we say the word actor around here, that could only mean one thing - Adam Davidson's father, Broadway actor Jack Davidson. But, you know, that's a little bit nepotistic. So instead, we got Adam Davidson's cousin, Broadway actor Jonathan Hadary. And we are going to play this little exchange. In it, Jonathan Hadary will play the role of the Goldman lawyer Greg Palm, and our very own David Kestenbaum will play the role of the intrepid UBS analyst Glenn Schorr, who asks the question that starts the whole exchange off. That question? Wait - what exactly did Goldman say to ACA about Paulson?

DAVID KESTENBAUM, BYLINE: (As Glenn Schorr) I'm curious on one thing. If there was no misrepresentation about Paulson being a long, how were they introduced into the process? In other words, they were obviously making suggestions into what securities ACA should include. But under what capacity were they introduced? If it wasn't a long or a short, what were they doing?

JONATHAN HADARY: (As Greg Palm) My first comment would be - and I think you probably know this very well - which is in this market, there has to be a - you know, a long and short that is perfectly clear. The other point I really emphasize is that in order to have a transaction in this market, you have to have, you know, some reference portfolio of securities which is satisfactory to both the longs who are looking at the portfolio - they're not really looking at anything else - and the shorts who are looking at the same portfolio deciding that. And as you know, whether the shorts are us or anyone else, Paulson entered the process here with ACA, and at least based on the record we know, we actually have no idea where ACA got - assuming they did, because that's what's alleged here - the impression that Paulson was a, quote, "equity investor."

KESTENBAUM: (As Glenn Schorr) But how did they know that there was a transaction going on? Meaning, I know Paulson approached you and wanted certain exposure. How did ACA get introduced to Paulson?

HADARY: (As Greg Palm) I'm sure we would have put them in contact with each other. But to get into the - you know, do I recall precisely what date that occurred on? How that - no, there is no evidence that's been introduced to us as to exactly what that involved. But, you know...

KESTENBAUM: (As Glenn Schorr) OK. I think I read...

HADARY: (As Greg Palm) And I'm sorry. Your - also, your question is, what was ACA thinking? I don't know, you know, for sure what they were thinking simply because, as I've described, we've been part of this case, and the only evidence we've been given is - to what they were, quote, "thinking" is the SEC's statement as to what they were thinking and as to how we influenced that thinking as to what they were thinking. You see it in the complaint. So I have no knowledge beyond that.

BLUMBERG: That certainly clears it up.

GOLDSTEIN: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDSTEIN: Now, our listeners should know we made that dramatic recreation as close to the real thing as possible, down to those two long pauses. We tried to make them the exact same length as the original conference call. Every um, you know, stumble was recreated to the best of our ability.

BLUMBERG: And I listened to the real thing, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Jonathan Hadary should get a Tony for the performance.

GOLDSTEIN: I think that probably wraps it up here for us today. We'll leave it with Alex Blumberg's drama criticism. I'll be following this story on the blog, npr.org/money. Send us your thoughts, questions, comments to planetmoney@npr.org.

I'm Jacob Goldstein.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thank you for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME")

THE RACONTEURS: (Singing) Reason. But in the core of my heart, your ignorance is treason. And there's always another point of view, a better way to do the things we do. And how can you know me and I know you if nothing is true?

Obviously, the events of the last week or so, including a major investment firm in New
York, without getting into the decision, a legal matter, let there be no doubt in my
mind.
Our bill would have prevented that kind of events from happening, in my view.
And that's what the public needs to know.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And I'm Jacob Goldstein.
Today's Tuesday, April 20th.
And that was Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, you heard at the top, talking
about the Senate's financial regulations bill.
Welcome, Jacob.
It's good to have you behind the microphone and away from out of the blog cave.
Glad to be here, Alex.
I'm glad to hear I won't be sent back to the blog.
Exactly.
You're here to stay for today's podcast.
Really excited.
Which is a good one.
On the program today, did Goldman Sachs defraud its customers?
And we will continue on our quest to bring a little bit of Broadway to financial reporting.
But first, Jacob, you want to start us off with the indicator?
Today's indicator, Alex, $3.5 billion.
I know what that figure is.
It's been all over the news today.
It's been all over the news today.
It's how much profit Goldman made in the first quarter of 2010.
It's a number that was a lot higher than analysts were expecting.
Now this might be the first time in history where financial companies executives were
actually a little bit bummed about good earnings because, you know, this earnings
news comes on the heels of revelations last Friday that the SEC had sued Goldman
Sachs for fraud, saying that they violated securities law.
I'm not sure Goldman's execs were bummed about a $3.5 billion profit.
Maybe not. It's just bad optics, as they say on Wall Street.
One day you're getting sued for fraud, the next day you're making
unexpectedly huge profits.
It doesn't look good.
Right. So today on the show, we're going to talk about the charges
against Goldman.
And we're also going to talk about that big planet money story on This
American Life recently about the hedge fund Magnetar, which was working with
other Wall Street banks doing very similar transactions to the transaction
that the SEC is suing Goldman over.
And you have been following these events very closely.
You've been following the SEC's case.
And so, Jacob, could you just break it down for us?
According to the SEC, how did Goldman defraud its clients?
So the SEC, they really set this up like a story in the complaint they
filed against Goldman.
It starts with a hedge fund called Paulson and Company.
Paulson and Company wants to bet against the housing market.
One way to do that is with something called the synthetic CDO.
So Paulson goes to Goldman and says, can you help us create this thing,
create this synthetic CDO?
Now, in order to create a synthetic CDO, you not only need somebody
betting against the housing market, you need somebody to bet on the
housing market.
Now, according to the SEC, Goldman says, well, yeah, we can help you
create this thing.
But, you know, if we tell the whole world, well, we created this
thing because some hedge fund came to us and wanted to bet against it.
No one's going to want to invest in it.
No one's going to want to take the other side of that bet, say, we
will bet on the housing market.
If they know that this hedge fund, Paulson and Company had come to
Goldman Sachs and said, create this for me.
Exactly.
So what Goldman Sachs does is it goes to this company called ACA.
ACA is in the business of putting together these CDOs.
They're called CDO Manager.
They're a CDO Manager.
Right.
And Goldman basically hires ACA to put this CDO together.
ACA puts it together.
Paulson bets against it.
Other investors bet on it.
The CDO blows up.
Paulson makes a lot of money.
The other investors lose a lot of money.
So is that the fraud that this thing just blew up?
It's not the fraud.
In fact, it's going to take us a while to get to the fraud.
There's still more to the story.
It's so far so good, according to the SEC.
So the thing is this hedge fund, which is run by this guy, John
Paulson, who became famous for betting against the housing market
and making a ton of money.
So according to the SEC, Paulson, he didn't just bet against this CDO.
He actually helped build it.
And that's a big deal, right?
Well, yeah.
Certainly, according to the SEC, it is.
I mean, it's really central to the SEC's case.
The SEC is saying, look, this guy, this hedge fund,
had a lot of input into what went into the CDO.
Presumably, if the hedge fund's betting against it,
they're going to want to put really risky stuff in it.
But even though this is a big deal,
it still actually doesn't get to the fraud, right?
Right.
But I can tell you, we're there.
I'm going to get you there right now.
We're almost at the fraud.
OK.
So here's the fraud, according to the SEC.
The SEC says Goldman should have told investors
about Paulson's role in building this thing.
But Goldman didn't do that.
So Paulson comes to Goldman saying,
I need a way to bet against the housing market.
Goldman says, sure, hires ACA to build a CDO,
which Paulson can use as a vehicle for betting
against the housing market.
And then Goldman has to go out and find people
who want to bet on the housing market,
essentially to take the other side of Paulson's bet.
And that part, the finding of the other people
to take the other side of Paulson's bet,
that is where the SEC says the fraud was.
Yeah, the SEC says Goldman had a responsibility
to tell people who were buying this thing
that Paulson played a significant role
in putting it together.
And by failing to tell investors about Paulson's role,
the SEC says Goldman defrauded those investors.
Now, this SEC case reminded a lot of us around here
about the story that I recently did on This American Life.
It was a Planet Money story on This American Life.
It aired about a week ago
on the This American Life episode called Inside Job.
And I reported that story with two investigative reporters
from the Outfit Pro Publica,
which is a nonprofit investigative reporting group.
The two reporters were Jake Bernstein
and Jesse Isinger.
And in that story, we talked about a hedge fund
that seemed to be doing very similar things
to what Paulson was doing.
And we also talked about some other Wall Street banks
that seemed to be doing very similar things
to what the SEC says Goldman was doing.
Right, the hedge fund had that name
that stuck in my head, Magnetar.
Right, it was a story about Magnetar.
And Magnetar was asking Wall Street banks
to create CDOs that it then bet against,
similar to what Paulson did.
And in the story that we did on This American Life,
we compared sort of what they were doing
to the plot of the producers,
you know, that Mel Brooks movie and musical.
Magnetar, the hedge fund,
in cooperation with Wall Street banks
was putting on a play that they wanted to flop
because they'd make more money if it failed
than if it succeeded.
Right, and of course this American Life piece
took that idea and ran with it.
There's the whole Broadway show tune
about this whole story.
You can listen to that on thisamericanlife.org.
You can read the print version of the story
at propublica.org.
So Adam Davidson and I called up
one of the reporters that we worked with
on that story, Jake Bernstein.
He's at ProPublica.
And he's been following the SEC's investigation
very closely.
And we asked him, you know,
what Paulson was doing with Goldman,
how close was that to what Magnetar was doing
with the Wall Street firms that it was working with?
The similarities are that in the case
of the Goldman-Paulson deal,
John Paulson is, you know,
he has influence on the deal.
What kinds of assets go into the deal?
You know, he's at the table
making those kinds of decisions
or helping to make those kinds of decisions, it appears.
And then he's betting against that deal.
So certainly our reporting has indicated,
you know, that Magnetar had some influence
in what these deals looked like.
And they also, in many cases,
bet against the very same deals.
So Magnetar was sort of filling
the same function as Paulson.
Exactly.
So in the Goldman case it was Paulson
and in our reporting it was Magnetar.
They were the same role.
Right, but there's a key difference here.
It appears from reading the SEC complaint
that Paulson was just short abacus.
He did not actually-
You mean he only bet against-
He only bet against abacus.
He didn't actually buy any equity
or be on the other side of that deal in any way.
Now Magnetar's argument has always been,
hey, we were long,
meaning we believed in these CDOs
that were being created with our encouragement,
but we shorted them just in case.
We had a hedge.
We had an insurance policy just in case they went bad.
Paulson could not make that argument.
Right.
Paulson is a one directional bet, it appears.
He is betting against, you know,
he basically went to Goldman and said,
you know, I want to bet against this stuff.
I don't believe in it.
And they helped him construct the deal.
So Jake, it seems like for the SEC to make its case,
it comes down to the same issue in both of these examples,
both the Magnetar case and the Goldman case,
which is there's a concept of materiality.
The investment bank has to disclose everything
that will be of material interest to a potential investor
so that the investor is fully informed
about when they make their investment decision.
And in this case, the SEC is essentially arguing
it was material for other investors to know
that Paulson had come to us and asked us to create the CDO.
And if they had known that-
For the purposes of shorting it.
For the purposes of shorting that.
And if they had known that,
then perhaps investors would have thought twice
about buying into this investment.
And that is the same situation
that we raised in the Magnetar story.
I'm going to just play a quick little clip from that.
Here's you and Jesse talking about this.
So if the investment bank came to an investor
and said, we have got an investment for you,
a hedge fund actually asked us to create it.
And they asked us to put riskier assets into the deal.
And, oh, by the way, they're betting against it.
Would you like to buy it?
And the answer is going to be obvious.
They're not going to do it.
The role of Magnetar, both as equity investor
and in their bets against the very CDOs
they helped create,
were not disclosed in any way to investors
in the written documents about the deals.
Not the marketing material, not the prospectuses,
not in the hundreds of pages
that an investor could get
to see information about the deal.
Was it disclosed that it was in fact Magnetar
who had helped create the deal and who bet against it?
I mean, it's the same kinds of disclosure issues.
What did the investment banks have to tell investors
about the nature of these deals?
And it's one of those issues
that is frankly a little gray and a little muddy.
So Jacob, let's just dive into the gray mud here.
Goldman denies the charges
that the SEC is leveled against it, right?
Goldman is mounting a vigorous defense
and they're making a few arguments.
One is that, look, there is this company, ACA.
ACA got paid to choose what assets went into the CDO.
It was their responsibility.
They made the call.
And Goldman told investors ACA is the company
that decided what went into this.
So even if Paulson had suggested
whatever he wanted to go into these CDOs,
it doesn't matter that it's ACA's job to judge that
and to put them in or not put them in if it sees fit.
Right, Goldman saying, look, ACA was there.
It wasn't our, it wasn't Goldman's responsibility
to tell investors, Paulson said this,
Paulson said that it's ACA's call
and we're telling everybody that it was ACA's call
and this is what ACA does.
This is what this company does.
Goldman also makes another argument.
They say, look, we also told all the investors
in this thing what the underlying assets were,
how it was gonna be put together.
You know, the investors, which were big banks,
not mom and pop, had all the information they needed,
all the savvy they needed to decide
whether or not to put their money into this thing or not.
And now what's interesting is so far
what we're talking about,
there's actually no disagreement about the facts, right?
That's exactly right.
They agree on the same set of facts, right?
The SEC and Goldman.
Right, they, you know, the whole story so far
is basically the same story and it's just the SEC saying,
well, Goldman, given this story,
you have this responsibility to tell investors,
hey, Paulson gave this input.
And Goldman is saying, no, given this whole story,
we don't have that responsibility.
It was ACA's call.
It all comes down to that issue
that was, we just heard about materiality.
That's right.
Now there is one detail where the SEC
and Goldman do seem to disagree on the facts.
Now I've heard you talking about this detail.
You feel like this detail could possibly
end up being important?
It certainly really caught my attention today.
I wrote about it this morning on the blog
and I'm really, I'm really interested.
I'm really curious what the answer is gonna be.
Okay.
So this is basically the deal.
The SEC, in addition to everything
we've been talking about,
the SEC also says that Goldman actually misled ACA
into thinking that Paulson was betting on the CDO
instead of betting against it.
So in Wall Street lingo,
they led ACA to believe that Paulson was long,
meaning betting that housing prices would stay high
or keep going up,
rather than telling ACA that Paulson was short,
betting against the CDO,
betting that housing prices will fall.
And in a statement Goldman Sachs made last Friday,
they flatly denied this.
They said, and I'm quoting,
Goldman Sachs never represented to ACA
that Paulson was going to be a long investor.
Cut to this morning when I'm listening
to Goldman Sachs conference call.
And it was this, this was the call
where they announced the incredible profits
that they made.
That's right, but the incredible profits
not withstanding all the Wall Street analysts
who listen and ask questions on these calls
actually seemed more interested in the SEC lawsuit
than in Goldman's blockbuster profits,
which was nice for me because also I was,
frankly, a little bit more interested in the lawsuit.
So this one analyst asked about that denial
that Goldman issued on Friday
and that we're talking about.
And the way this Goldman exec on the call
answered that question was really convoluted,
and not so much like that very crisp, clear denial
that we had last week.
In fact, we've been listening to this exchange
over and over here at Planet Money.
There's a lot of long pauses
and tortured syntax and fumbling.
You can almost imagine the lawyer
and the executive sort of pressing mute
and whispering back and forth
and then coming back on the call.
Unfortunately, we can't play the tape.
We asked Goldman for permission,
but we didn't hear back.
You can hear it if you want to online.
I'll post a link from the blog.
And pr.org slash money.
Thank you.
And as a special service to our podcast listeners,
we got an actor to read this one particular exchange.
And now Planet Money regulars might know
when we say the word actor around here,
that could only mean one thing,
Adam Davidson's father, Broadway actor, Jack Davidson.
But you know, that's a little bit nepotistic.
So instead we got Adam Davidson's cousin,
Broadway actor, Jonathan Hadari.
And we are going to play this little exchange in it.
Jonathan Hadari will play the role
of the Goldman lawyer, Greg Palm.
And our very own David Kestenbaum
will play the role of the intrepid UBS analyst,
Glenn Shore, who asks the question
that starts the whole exchange off,
that question, wait, what exactly did Goldman say
to ACA about Paulson?
I'm curious on one thing.
If there was no misrepresentation
about Paulson being a long,
how were they introduced into the process?
In other words, they were obviously making suggestions
into what securities ACA should include,
but under what capacity were they introduced?
If it wasn't a long or a short, what were they doing?
My first comment would be,
and I think you probably know this very well,
which is in this market, there has to be a,
you know, a long and short that is perfectly clear.
The other point I really emphasize
is that in order to have a transaction in this market,
you have to have, you know,
some reference portfolio of securities,
which is satisfactory to both the longs
who are looking at the portfolio.
They're not really looking at anything else.
And the shorts who are looking at the same portfolio
are deciding that.
And as you know,
whether the shorts are us or anyone else.
Paulson entered the process here with ACA
and at least based on the record we know,
we have no idea where ACA got, assuming they did,
because that's what's alleged here,
the impression that Paulson was a quote, equity investor.
But how did they know
that there was a transaction going on?
Meaning, I know Paulson approached you
and wanted certain exposure.
How did ACA get introduced to Paulson?
I'm sure we would have put them in contact
with each other, but to get into the, you know,
do I recall precisely what date that occurred on?
How that, no, there is no evidence
that's been introduced to us as exactly what that involved.
But you know.
Okay, I think I read the first part.
And I'm sorry, you're also,
your question is what was ACA thinking?
I don't know, you know,
for sure what they were thinking
simply because as I've described,
we've been part of this case
and the only evidence we've been given
is to what they were quote thinking
is the SEC statement as to what they were thinking
and as to how we influence that thinking
as to what they were thinking.
You see it in the complaint.
So I have no knowledge beyond that.
That certainly clears it up.
Now our listeners should know
we made that dramatic recreation
as close to the real thing as possible.
Down to those two long pauses,
we tried to make them the exact same length
as the original conference call.
Every, you know, stumble was recreated
to the best of our ability.
And I listened to the real thing
and I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say Jonathan Hadari should get a Tony
for the performance.
I think that probably wraps it up here for us today.
We'll leave it with Alex Bloomberg's drama criticism.
I'll be following this story on the blog npr.org slash money.

I love you, a better way to do the things we do.
