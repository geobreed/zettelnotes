This is the first episode in a new series we're trying out. The Planet Money Deep Read will feature in-depth conversations with big thinkers. Today on the Planet Money Deep Read, we talk with Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, about his new book: The End of the Free Market.



We come across all these fascinating books that we don't have time to dig into on the regular Planet Money podcast. So we're trying something new.

From time to time, we'll offer a special, bonus podcast where we talk to big thinkers about their ideas.

Today, Adam Davidson talks to Ian Bremmer about his new book, The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War Between States and Corporations?

Bremmer argues that free-market capitalism is increasingly conflicting with "state capitalism," where states use markets for political gain.

He cites the recent conflict between China and Google as an example. He says, ultimately, the conflict wasn't about freedom of speech or human rights. It was about China supporting a Chinese search company called Baidu.

"The Chinese government preferred a private company, but a Chinese private company — Baidu," he says.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

Hello, and welcome, but not to the PLANET MONEY podcast. No. Today we are bringing you the PLANET MONEY Deep Read podcast. I'm Adam Davidson.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

And I'm Alex Blumberg. And this is this new thing that we're trying. It's an extra podcast in addition to our regularly scheduled Tuesday and Friday podcasts. And we're testing it out for the first time today.

DAVIDSON: So the basic idea is we get all these books, and we talk to these big thinkers who have these big, broad ideas about how the world works. And we often have a lot of fun having these big, long, broad-ranging conversations with these folks. And we thought you guys probably would like to listen in every once in a while.

BLUMBERG: So today we're bringing you the first one. Think of it as a PLANET MONEY bonus extra that we're going to try out from time to time.

DAVIDSON: This is a conversation I had with Ian Bremmer - he's a podcast regular - the president of Eurasia Group, a consulting group that advises businesses on how to deal with the economic implications of world politics.

BLUMBERG: He's the guy you would call if you were, say, the president of Coke, and there was a coup in Thailand.

DAVIDSON: Exactly. He's got a brand-new book with a provocative title - "The End Of The Free Market: Who Wins The War Between States And Corporations?"

BLUMBERG: So who does win?

DAVIDSON: All right. I'm going to say this for the first time in my life. Stay tuned to find out.

Let's start quick - let's lay out what is the big idea in this book, and then we'll dig a little deeper. But you're saying it's the end of the free market, so we're clearly going back to communism or feudalism or mercantilism. Explain to me what your argument is.

IAN BREMMER: I'm saying that there used to be a global - an increasingly global - free market over the last 40 years. Multinational corporations were becoming increasingly powerful as economic actors in - with access to increasingly global capital markets, consumer markets and labor markets. And we've hit a tipping point in the last 18 months as a consequence of this massive global economic contraction. The Western developed states with free market economies - some more regulated, some very unregulated - are on their heels now. And the fastest economy coming out of the recession - world's second-largest now and fastest growing - is China. And it's not a free market system. It's actually a state capital system, a system where the state is the principal actor and arbiter in the economy and uses the markets for ultimately political purposes.

DAVIDSON: And not just China, as you make clear in the book, but many, many countries around the world in - throughout the world - Asia, Latin America, the Middle East...

BREMMER: Sure.

DAVIDSON: ...Eastern Europe.

BREMMER: Russia, many countries in the Middle East, most all of the Persian Gulf, a lot of commodities producers around the world - there are a lot of state capitalist countries out there. And so what we have are these states that are actually using the tools of the markets, but they're using them to support their own domestic players, their own national champions. Some of them are state-owned; some of them aren't. The issue here is that you have both the state as the principal actor in the economy, but also no rule of law. And so as a consequence, you are willing to accept all sorts of foreign direct investment as you need capital, and you're willing to accept all sorts of technology as you need the innovation. But if you don't need it anymore, and if your guys can produce it themselves, you'll do it yourself. And that hybrid proves strong.

DAVIDSON: Let me just - I want to - you say no rule of law. Now, I think, in one way in my mind, I think, well, when the government's doing something, that is the rule of law. But what - I think what you mean is the government of China, the government of Saudi Arabia, the government of Venezuela can act more arbitrarily to pursue their own self-interest than, say, the government of the U.S. can, that if suddenly President Obama decided everyone should buy Fords instead of Toyotas, he - you know, he can use the bully pulpit. There are levers he can pull. But he - but there are laws that he has to follow. There's constraints.

BREMMER: Let's imagine that President Obama wanted to rip up $165 million of contracts, bonuses to AIG workers that everyone in the country hated. If he...

DAVIDSON: Which he - which...

BREMMER: ...Which he thought about.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

BREMMER: And then he realized three days later it was a bad idea. And the reason he realized it was a bad idea is we were going to get lawyered up for years in this country because even if it's something you really don't like, there are laws. There are contracts. You don't just get nationalized. You have the right to go and defend yourself. But the point is that in a state capitalist country - right? - the state arbitrarily decides what the rules of the game are going to be. And they don't really tell you, right?

I mean, if you think about - I have this analogy. I talk about a football field, a football pitch, where, in a free-market economy that's properly regulated, you have a referee on the field who is ensuring that the rules are followed. You get penalized if you don't follow them. Now, in the last 10 years, the ref wasn't paying attention to the game in a lot of countries. But that's the way it works, right? In a state capitalist country, you have a ref who tells one of the teams what the rules are, and that team is made up of your friends and family, right? And so if you're a member of the other team, you're probably not going to do very well in those games that the ref wants his buddies to win.

DAVIDSON: Well, I think - this is exactly what I want to get into. So first off, I just want to explain, when you say tools of the market without being free market - I guess the primary tool of the market is the price system, the price signal as a way of allocating resources. And when capitalist economists critique communism, they say, well, they didn't have the price system - you know, supply and demand, a price signal that when oranges start costing more, that's a signal that it's - that they are rarer, or there's more demand for them. So there should be some effort made to increase the supply. And it all happens very chaotically. There's no central governor saying, all right, oranges should now be 30 cents. And when you do have a central planning authority, like the Soviet Union did, the general conclusion is - that seems true - is that any one small group of people cannot know enough information to actually allocate resources correctly.

So in the U.S., which is not, as you point out frequently in the book, is not truly a free market economy. It's a managed economy, but probably less managed than many other economies. In the U.S., generally, the government doesn't really take a view on how resources are allocated in many cases. But China will take a view on a whole bunch of issues. And so state capitalism is a system where the price signal is allowed to work in most cases. But there is a central power that tips the scale, that has - that can exert arbitrary and huge power when they want things to go away that the market - that the price signal would not send them on their own.

BREMMER: Yes, can and will for ultimately political purposes, to ensure their own sustainability. State capitalism is not a global ideology. It's not meant to maximize economic profits. It's meant - it's statist. It is meant to keep states in power. Globalization - aspects of globalization were a direct challenge and affront to them, and state capitalism is their direct response. And the problem is that, ultimately, state capitalism and free market capitalism are incompatible economic systems.

DAVIDSON: So, all right. So let's go to China 'cause it seems to me that right now, China - you just said state capitalism and market capitalism are incompatible. It seems like China is a huge argument against that point, that China's doing really, really well on both metrics. They're growing much faster than the U.S., than the West. They're more stable. They're - you know, they were buffeted less by this global crisis than we were. And they're as powerful as ever, it seems, the Chinese Communist Party.

BREMMER: They are - the massive thing that has changed - the game-changing element of world politics and world economics is that the Chinese government has recognized - and there's a consensus in Beijing on this - that they can no longer ensure their economic growth and, therefore, their political stability because of what's happened in the last 18 months. The Chinese recognize that they're not going to be able to export as much stuff to the West because the West can't buy the way they used to, and they won't be able to. So as a consequence, you have a system where the Chinese, suddenly, are supporting massive indigenous innovation. They have to to maintain their stability. They're pumping up their own companies, both state-owned and privately owned, because, you know, those - they're becoming now very competitive internationally. And we're going to see, as I suggest in the book, a war between states and corporations. And in places where that war can't be averted, the corporations will lose.

And this happened first, of course, publicly with Google, which was not a human rights issue, ultimately, and it wasn't a freedom of speech issue. It was that the Chinese government preferred a private company, but a Chinese private company - Baidu. And so, as a consequence, we were Googled out. And this is happening to hundreds of American and Western, Japanese, European corporations investing in China right now. They just don't want to say it publicly because they have a lot to lose. But they're all saying it privately, and not just us. I mean, they're saying it to the American government. They're saying it anonymously to the U.S.-China Chamber of Commerce. This is a game changer. And we are only starting to understand this. This is - we're all right now focused on "The Big Short" and Goldman Sachs and the last 18 months, and let's beat up on banks. And it feels really good to do that. But we are absolutely not yet paying any attention to the fact that the world around us has changed more dramatically in the last 18 months than at any point since World War II.

DAVIDSON: Wow. And so here's what my economic training teaches me about where China is right now. They are facing an unbelievably perilous moment that - so where China has been, up till what you've just described, this transition you've just described, is catching up, copying from us. There's - you know, as our reporting on Haiti tells us, as, you know, any very poor country you see, there's - if you're much less productive, much farther behind technologically than the West, there are - it's not that hard to grow very quickly once you get a few things right because there's just - I mean, just in agricultural alone, there's so many innovations. If you take a typical Chinese peasant who was operating, basically, in a medieval technological world and you bring them up to the 19th century or even the 18th century, they're going to be a lot more productive. You can sort of have, you know, turnkey businesses, where you just get some Westerner to build you a TV factory or whatever. And you can instantly employ a lot of people, make some money. And that copying process, in my mind, is very compatible with state capitalism. It might be more compatible.

But the theory, anyway - and I guess now we're going to actually find out. But the economic theory is the next step - indigenous growth, indigenous innovation, actually Chinese companies coming up with new ideas - it requires - it - that is incompatible with state control because if you don't have intellectual property protection, then you don't have an incentive for people to create new ideas. You have an incentive for people to copy other people's ideas. If you don't allow the market itself to allocate bank loans, if the government's allocating bank loans, then it's not going to be the best, most productive businesses that get loans. It's going to be the cousin of the governor or whatever who gets the loans. And so my economic training leads me to predict that maybe China switching to we're going to do this ourselves - that's going to be a rough time for China. That - it's not going to work.

BREMMER: I suspect you're right. Certainly, that is my belief as well, on the basis of, you know, all of the limited historical data and the theoretical training that I have. But I also say to people that tell me, well, you know, China is going to be like Japan, and it's going to have, you know, a lost decade or two lost decades or what have you - this is not a near-term bubble. We've never seen - there's no question. The Chinese system is less efficient, particularly when it comes to the decisions of how to effectively allocate capital and how to stimulate your own indigenous innovation. It's going to be very hard for them to build and try to become a developed country. But when you have 1.3 billion people, when you have such extraordinary greenfield sites - I mean 60% of all of the new nuclear plants in the world that are presently being developed or have been approved are in China. The building there is just extraordinary. The relative productivity that they can continue to bring online with new labor is something unlike the world has ever seen before.

And so I can agree with you. OK, China is a bubble. OK, they're not going to have sustainability in their environment in 20 years' time. OK, they're not going to have sustainability of their labor demographics in 20 years' time. But I also look at the last two years, and I recognize that today, the average Chinese is better disposed towards their own government than the average American or Japanese or Greek or German are to their governments. The last 18 months have given these guys a much longer lease on life, and it wasn't even close to falling apart before the economic crisis. So I sit here saying, you know what? I feel very, very comfortable that at least looking out five years, maybe even 10, that we're not going to see China collapse, that the problems that you are suggesting, that I think you're right about, are - they're not going to hit China tomorrow.

DAVIDSON: They're 2030's problems.

BREMMER: They may be - they're at least 2020, 2025. And you know what? I don't know many people out there that are really planning for 2025. I know people that are saying what's going to happen in the next year, two years, five years? And in the next one, two, five years, the problem of the end of the free market and the coming war between states and corporations becomes vastly more acute.

DAVIDSON: So explain this war between corporations and states. Obviously, if we were writing a movie in the 1970s, we'd be talking about an actual war between corporations and states, effectively - or cities, anyway. Is that what you're talking about, you know, Halliburton up against the People's Revolutionary Army?

BREMMER: Well, you see that on my cover, I actually have tanks.

DAVIDSON: Right.

BREMMER: And some of the tanks have skyscrapers on them, and some of them have government capitals on them. And, you know, I thought that was sufficiently evocative. I'm not talking about conventional wars, of course. But I have to tell you that when you have hundreds of Western multinational corporations that have seen industrial espionage that's been directly targeted at them through cyberattacks - massive, unprecedented cyberattacks - that either were directly organized by the Chinese government or were known about and actively tolerated by the Chinese government on behalf of Chinese corporations, that's a pretty good description of a war.

I mean, national security is no longer about tanks. National security is increasingly about economic well-being and internet security and issues that allow us to live on a day-to-day basis. We're not worried today about the Soviets blowing us up with nukes, but we are worried that our kids are going to be able to enjoy a quality of life that is vaguely related to our own. And I see this as absolutely being a fundamentally conflictual relationship that is coming out between these corporations that are increasingly going to have to fight against other entities, economic entities, that are being supported by governments where there isn't a rule of law.

DAVIDSON: So I want to sort of wrap things up and - with - what does this mean for the average person? What does it mean for me, who doesn't run a multinational corporation? My sense is it just means - this is just a lousier world, right? I mean, it's a world where everything we know about economics tells us there's going to be less economic growth in general. If China doesn't grow as much as we'd like it to, then we don't sell products. And if we're not allowed to sell products to them, then we don't sell products to them. So we don't then grow. We don't get the advantage of China having a more consumer-led economic growth. If you have more failed states around the world or just economic basket cases around the world, that's just bad for us, right?

BREMMER: Certainly in this world, with globalization increasingly challenged by state capitalism, market size globally and market access globally decreases. And that means less global economic growth - no question. Hand in hand with that is a world where you see less coordinated governance. And on issues that are increasingly global, that require coordinated responses like climate change and like nuclear proliferation and like trade and financial regulations and the like, you will not see global responses. You'll see Copenhagen. And that means that you're also going to see less efficiency and more spikes as bigger events that hit as a consequence to global markets are things we have to deal with. So the next 10 years, we are in for a rougher ride. And not just we Americans, though clearly, from a trajectory perspective, we can say we Americans - this is a global issue.

DAVIDSON: Great. All right. I think that's a sufficiently depressing place to end. So thank you so much, Ian Bremmer - "The End Of The Free Market: Who Wins The War Between States And Corporations?"

BREMMER: Adam, my pleasure.

BLUMBERG: That was a fascinating conversation, Adam.

DAVIDSON: Thank you, Alex. We want to ask our listeners. Send us notes at planetmoney@npr.org. Let us know. Do you like the idea of having a deep read? Are there books and authors that you are particularly excited about? We're not sure how often we're going to do it, but we'd love to hear if this is something that you enjoy. Meanwhile, I'm Adam Davidson.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thanks for listening to the PLANET MONEY Deep Read.

DAVIDSON: The regular PLANET MONEY podcast will come back on Friday.

**faster whisper:**
Hello and welcome, but not to the Planet Money podcast. No, today we are bringing
you the Planet Money Deep Read podcast. I'm Adam Davidson. And I'm Alex Bloomberg.
And this is this new thing that we're trying. It's an extra podcast in
addition to our regularly scheduled Tuesday and Friday podcasts. And we're
testing it out for the first time today. So the basic idea is we get all
these books and we talk to these big thinkers who have these big broad ideas
about how the world works. And we often have a lot of fun having these
big, long, broad ranging conversations with these folks. And we thought you guys
probably would like to listen in every once in a while. So today we are
bringing you the first one. Think of it as a Planet Money bonus extra that
we're going to try out from time to time. This is a conversation I had
with Ian Bremmer. He's a podcast regular, the president of Eurasia
Group, a consulting group that advises businesses on how to deal
with the economic implications of world politics. He's the guy you would
call if you were, say, the president of Coke and there was a coup
in Thailand. Exactly. He's got a brand new book with a provocative title,
The End of the Free Market. Who Wins the War Between States and
Corporations? So who does win? All right. I'm going to say this
for the first time in my life. Stay tuned to find out. Let's
start quickly. Let's lay out what is the big idea in this book
and then we'll dig a little deeper. But you're saying it's the
end of the free market. So we're clearly going back to communism
or feudalism or mercantilism. Explain to me what your argument
is. I'm saying that there used to be a global, an increasingly
global free market over the last 40 years. Multinational
corporations were becoming increasingly powerful as economic
actors with access to increasingly global capital
markets, consumer markets and labor markets. And we've hit a
tipping point in the last 18 months as a consequence of this
massive global economic contraction. The Western developed states
with free market economies, some more regulated, some very
unregulated, are on their heels now. And the fastest economy
coming out of the recession, world's second largest now and
fastest growing, is China. And it's not a free market
system. It's actually a state capital system, a system where
the state is the principal actor and arbiter in the economy
and uses the markets for ultimately political purposes.
And not just China, as you make clear in the book, but
many, many countries around the world and throughout the
world, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe,
Russia, many countries in the Middle East, most all of the
Persian Gulf, a lot of commodities producers around
the world. There are a lot of state capitalist countries out
there. And so what we have are these states that are actually
using the tools of the markets, but they're using them to
support their own domestic players, their own national
champions, some of them are state owned, some of them
aren't. The issue here is that you have both the state
as the principal actor in the economy, but also no rule of
law. And so as a consequence, you are willing to
accept all sorts of foreign direct investment as you need
capital, and you're willing to accept all sorts of technology
as you need the innovation. But if you don't need it
anymore, and if your guys can produce it themselves, you'll
do it yourself. And that hybrid proves strong.
I want to you say no rule of law. Now, I think in one
way, in my mind, I think, well, when the government's
doing something, that is the rule of law. But what I think
what you mean is the government of China, the
government of Saudi Arabia, the government of Venezuela can
act more arbitrarily to pursue their own self interest
than say the government of the US can. That if if suddenly
President Obama, if suddenly President Obama decided
everyone should buy Fords instead of Toyotas, he, you
know, he can use the bully pulpit, there are levers he
can pull, but he but there are laws that he has to
follow.
Let's imagine that President Obama wanted to rip up 165
million dollars of contracts, bonuses to AIG workers, that
everyone in the country hated, which he thought about. And
then he realized three days later was a bad idea. And
the reason he realized it was a bad idea is we were
going to get loyered up for years in this country,
because even if it's something you really don't
like, there are laws, there are contracts, you don't
just get nationalized, you have the right to go and
defend yourself. But the point is that in a state
capitalist country, right, the state arbitrarily decides
what the rules of the game are going to be. And they
don't really tell you, right? I mean, if you think
about I have this analogy, I talk about a football
field, a football pitch, we're in a free market
economy that's properly regulated, you have a
referee on the field, who is ensuring that the
rules are followed. You get penalized if you
don't follow them. Now in the last 10 years, the
ref wasn't paying attention to the game in
a lot of countries. But that's the way it works,
right? In a state capitalist country, you have a
ref who tells one of the teams what the rules
are. And that team is made up of your friends and
family, right? And so if you're a member of the
other team, you're probably not going to do very
well in those games that the ref wants his
buddies to win.
Well, I think this is exactly what I want to
get into. So first off, I just want to explain
when you say tools of the market without being
free market, I guess the primary tool of the
market is the price system, the price signal as
a way of allocating resources. And when
capitalist economists critique communism, they
say, well, they didn't have the price system,
you know, supply and demand, a price signal
that when oranges start costing more, that's a
signal that it's that they are rarer or
there's more demand for them. So there should
be some effort made to increase the supply. And
it all happens very chaotically. There's no
central governor saying, all right, oranges
should now be 30 cents. And when you do have
a central planning authority like the Soviet
Union did, the general conclusion is, it seems
true, is that any one small group of people
cannot know enough information to actually
allocate resources correctly. So in the U.S.,
which is not, as you point out frequently
in the book, is not truly a free market
economy. It's a managed economy, but
probably less managed than many other
economies. In the U.S. generally, the
government doesn't really take a view on how
resources are allocated in many cases. But
China will take a view on a whole bunch of
issues. And so state capitalism is a system
where the price signal is allowed to work in
most cases, but there is a central power
that tips the scale that can exert arbitrary
and huge power when they want things to go
away that the market, that the price signal
would not send them on their own.
Yes, Ken and Will, for ultimately political
purposes, to ensure their own sustainability.
State capitalism is not a global ideology.
It's not meant to maximize economic
profits. It's meant, it's statist. It is
meant to keep states in power.
Globalization, aspects of globalization
were a direct challenge and a front to
them. And state capitalism is their
direct response. And the problem is that
ultimately state capitalism and free market
capitalism are incompatible economic systems.
So all right. So let's go to China because
it seems to me that right now China,
you just said state capitalism and market
capitalism are incompatible. It seems like
China is a huge argument against that
point that China is doing really, really
well on both metrics. They're growing much
faster than the US, than the West. They're
more stable. They're, you know, they were
buffeted less by this global crisis than
we were. And they're as powerful as ever,
it seems, the Chinese Communist Party.
They are. The massive thing that has
changed, the game changing element of
world politics and world economics, is
that the Chinese government has recognized
and there's a consensus in Beijing on
this, that they can no longer ensure their
economic growth and therefore their
political stability because of what's
happened in the last 18 months. The
Chinese recognize that they're not
going to be able to export as much
stuff to the West because the West
can't buy the way they used to and
they won't be able to. So as a
consequence, you have a system where
the Chinese suddenly are supporting
massive indigenous innovation. They have
to, to maintain their stability. They're
pumping up their own companies, both
state owned and privately owned, because
you know, those, they're becoming now
very competitive internationally. And
we're going to see, as I suggest in
the book, a war between states and
corporations. And in places where that
war can't be averted, the
corporations will lose. And this
happened first, of course, publicly
with Google, which was not a human
rights issue, ultimately, and it
wasn't a freedom of speech issue. It
was that the Chinese government preferred
a private company, but a Chinese
private company, Baidu. And so as a
consequence, we were Googled out. And
this is happening to hundreds of
American and Western Japanese European
corporations investing in China right
now. They just don't want to say it
publicly because they have a lot to
lose, but they're all saying it
privately and not just us. I mean,
they're saying to the American
government, they're saying it
anonymously to the US China Chamber
of Commerce. This is a game changer.
And we are only starting to
understand this. This is, we're
all right now focused on the big
short and Goldman Sachs and the
last 18 months. Let's beat up on
banks. And it feels really good to
do that. But we are absolutely not
yet paying any attention to the
fact that the world around us has
changed more dramatically in the
last 18 months than at any point
since World War Two.
And so here's what my economic
training teaches me about where
China is right now. They are
facing an unbelievably perilous
moment. So where China has been
up till what you've just
described, this transition you've
just described, is catching up,
copying from us. As our
reporting on Haiti tells us,
as any very poor country you
see, if you're much less
productive, much farther behind
technologically than the West,
there are, it's not that hard to
grow very quickly once you get a
few things right. Because there's
just, I mean, just in
agricultural alone, there's so
many innovations. If you take a
typical Chinese peasant who was
operating basically in a
medieval technological world and
you bring them up to the 19th
century or even the 18th
century, they're going to be a
lot more productive. You can
sort of have turnkey businesses
where you just get some
Westerner to build you a TV
factory or whatever, and you
can instantly employ a lot of
people, make some money. And
that copying process, in my
mind, is very compatible with
state capitalism. It might be
more compatible. But the
theory anyway, and I guess
now we're going to actually
find out, but the economic
theory is the next step,
indigenous growth, indigenous
innovation, actually Chinese
companies coming up with new
ideas, it requires, that is
incompatible with state
control. Because if you don't
have intellectual property
protection, then you don't
have an incentive for people
to create new ideas. You have
an incentive for people to
copy other people's ideas. If
you don't allow the market
itself to allocate bank loans,
if the government's allocating
bank loans, then it's not
going to be the best, most
productive businesses that get
loans. It's going to be the
cousin of the governor or
whatever who gets the loans.
And so my economic training
leads me to predict that
maybe China switching to
we're going to do this
ourselves, that's going to be
a rough time for China. It's
not going to work.
I suspect you're right.
Certainly that is my belief
as well on the basis of all
of the limited historical data
and the theoretical training
that I have. But I also
say to people that tell me,
well, you know, China is going
to be like Japan and it's
going to have a lost decade
or two lost decades or
what have you. This is not a
near-term bubble. We've never
seen, there's no question,
the Chinese system is less
efficient, particularly when it
comes to the decisions of how
to effectively allocate
capital and how to stimulate
your own indigenous
innovation. It's going to be
very hard for them to build
and try to become a developed
country. But when you have
1.3 billion people, when you
have such extraordinary
greenfield sites, I mean,
60% of all of the new
nuclear plants in the world
that are presently being
developed or have been
approved are in China. The
building there is just
extraordinary. The relative
productivity that they can
continue to bring online with
new labor is something unlike
the world has ever seen
before. And so I can agree
with you, okay, China is a
bubble. Okay, they're not
going to have sustainability
in their environment in 20
years time. Okay, they're
not going to have
sustainability of their labor
demographics in 20 years
time. But I also look at
the last two years and I
recognize that today, the
average Chinese is better
disposed towards their own
government than the average
American or Japanese or
Greek or German are to
their governments. The last
18 months have given these
guys a much longer lease on
life. And it wasn't even
close to falling apart
before the economic crisis.
So I sit here saying, you
know what, I feel very,
very comfortable that at
least looking out five
years, maybe even 10, that
we're not going to see
China collapse, that the
problems that you are
suggesting that I think
you're right about are
they're not going to hit
China tomorrow.
30s problem.
They may be there at
least 2020 2025. And you
know what, I don't know
many people out there that
are really planning for
2025. I know people that
are saying what's going to
happen in the next year,
two years, five years. And
in the next one, two,
five years, the problem
of the end of the free
market and the coming
war between states and
corporations becomes
vastly more acute.
So explain this war
between corporations and
states. Obviously, if we
were writing a movie in
the 1970s, we'd be
talking about an actual
war between corporations
and states effectively or
cities anyway. Is that
what you're talking
about? You know,
Halliburton up against
the people's revolutionary
army.
You see that on my on my
cover, I actually have
tanks and some of the
tanks have skyscrapers
on them. And some of
them have government
capitals on them. And,
you know, I thought that
was sufficiently evocative.
Well, I'm not talking
about conventional wars,
of course, but I have
to tell you that when
you have hundreds of
Western multinational
corporations that that
have seen industrial
espionage that's been
directly tie targeted
at them through cyber
attacks, massive
unprecedented cyber
attacks that either were
directly organized by
the Chinese Chinese
government or were known
about and actively
tolerated by the
Chinese government on
behalf of Chinese
corporations. That's a
pretty good description
of a war. I mean,
national security is
no longer about tanks.
National security is
increasingly about
economic well-being and
Internet security and
issues that allow us to
live on a basis. We're
not worried today about
the Soviets blowing us
up with nukes, but we
are worried that our
kids are going to be
able to enjoy a quality
of life that is vaguely
related to our own.
And I see this as
absolutely being a
fundamentally conflictual
relationship that is
coming out between these
corporations that are
increasingly going to
have to fight against
other entities,
economic entities that
are being supported by
governments where there
isn't rule of law.
So I want to sort of
wrap things up and with
what what does this mean
for the average person?
What does it mean for
me who doesn't run a
multinational corporation?
My sense is it just
means this is just a
lousier world. Right.
I mean it's a world
where everything we
know about economics
tells us there's going
to be less economic
growth in general. If
China doesn't grow as
much as we'd like it
to then we don't sell
products and if we're
not allowed to sell
products to them then
we don't sell products
to them. So we don't
we don't then grow.
We don't get the
advantage of China
having a more consumer
led economic growth.
If you have more failed
states around the world
or just economic basket
cases around the world
that that's just bad
for us. Right.
Certainly in this
world with globalization
increasingly challenged
by state capitalism
market size globally
and market access
globally decreases.
And that means less
global economic growth.
No question.
Hand in hand with that
is a world where you
see less
coordinated governance
and on issues that
are increasingly
global that require
coordinated responses
like climate change
and like nuclear
proliferation and like
trade and financial
regulations and the
like. You will not
see global responses.
You'll see Copenhagen
and that means that
you're also going to
see less efficiency
and more spikes as
bigger events
that that hit as a
consequence the global
markets are things
we have to deal with.
So the next 10 years
we are in for a rougher
ride and not just
we Americans though
clearly in it from a
trajectory perspective
we can say we Americans
this is a global issue.
Great. All right.
I think that's a
sufficiently depressing
place to end.
So thank you so much.
Ian Bremmer the end
of the free market who
wins the war between
states and corporations.
Adam my pleasure.
That was a fascinating
conversation Adam.
Thank you Alex.
