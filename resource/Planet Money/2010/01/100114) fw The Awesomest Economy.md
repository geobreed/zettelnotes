We take you to Denmark, land of bicycles, pigs, Ikea-like furniture and economic indicators that seem too good to be true. Denmark has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world and lowest income disparities. At one point the jobs picture was so good unemployment dropped below 2 percent, something some economists would tell you should be impossible. Despite having the highest taxes in the world, Denmark's economy has grown steadily. Plus, Danes are the happiest people in the world, at least according to one analysis.

We take you to Denmark, land of bicycles, pigs, Ikea-like furniture and economic indicators that seem too good to be true.

Denmark has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world and lowest income disparities. At one point the jobs picture was so good unemployment dropped below 2 percent, something some economists would tell you should be impossible. Despite having the highest taxes in the world, economist Ove Pedersen says Denmark's economy has grown steadily. Also, Danes are the happiest people in the world, at least according to one analysis.

Is Denmark a fluke? Or a model to be imitated.

**faster whisper:**
Given the competitive focus on maintaining market share, we didn't see as clearly as
I would have hoped the excesses, so we didn't raise a hand and ask whether some of those
trends and practices that became commonplace really serve the financial system's interests.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money. I'm Adam Davidson.
And I'm David Kestinbaum. Today is Wednesday, January 13th. That was Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd
Blankfein you heard at the top testifying before the Who's to Blame commission,
also known as the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission set up by Congress.
Our own Alex Bloomberg is down there today following that.
So expect to hear more on that. The big news story today, of course, is the devastating
earthquake in Haiti. We were looking at these photos of the presidential palace there,
which looks like it just collapsed. And we assume that's probably one of the better constructed
buildings. There are just horrible reports of people trapped and crushed under buildings
and no ability, no insight to get them out. As of this recording, we have absolutely no
idea what the death toll is, but it looks like this will be a major, major tragedy.
Haiti, of course, is a very poor country. And our indicator today is $760 million.
That is the amount of aid money countries around the world pledged to provide to Haiti.
And we're not talking about today after the earthquake. That was the amount pledged before
all this happened. We've been working with the United Nations Office on Haiti for a
few months now on a story we've wanted to do on Haiti. This is the office
supporting President Bill Clinton's efforts as special envoy to Haiti.
And he has been very disappointed in the follow through of richer countries to help in what he
says has been over the last few months, a real effort and a real credible effort to turn Haiti
around, to bring proper governance, proper health, and to restore the private sector so
Haiti can have self-sustaining growth. I called over to that office today and they said
they just, it's far too soon to have any idea what has happened to those efforts at this point.
They're just doing damage assessment and damage control, but they told me that
President Clinton is reaching out to major private sector companies, to governments,
et cetera, and not just him, of course. Many others are launching major, major appeals to
help the troubled country. And over the next year, we are planning to spend a lot of time
looking at this big question of why poor countries are poor and why they tend to stay poor.
And it turns out in order to understand that, it actually helps to look at countries
that are not poor and see why they work so well, sort of why rich countries are rich.
And I was in Denmark for the UN climate talks and when I was there, I got totally obsessed
with the economy because it's the opposite of Haiti on paper. You can consider it,
I've been trying to figure out how to slug this story, the awesomest economy in the world,
one of the more awesomer economies. I mean, here are some numbers. The GDP per capita is
very strong. Also, it's among the highest in the world. Unemployment at one point got so low,
it was less than 2%, which I was taught is theoretically impossible.
Theoretically impossible, right? They have the second or third lowest income disparity
in the world. That's the gap between rich and poor, one of the lowest poverty rates.
On that corruption index, it was almost the least corrupt country in the world.
They also have the highest income tax in the world though, so maybe that's not so awesome.
But by some surveys, they have the happiest people in the world.
And of course, they have the best furniture in the world.
The very best furniture in the world. So I had a lot of questions like,
how does this economy work? Does it really work that well? And can other countries copy it?
So right after I got off the plane when I went there, I met up with an economist,
Ove Peterson, who's at the Copenhagen Business School. And we went for a walk
through Copenhagen and it was raining. And I think you can hear the rain on the umbrella
in the recording here. And it was pitch dark. It gets pitch dark by 4 p.m. there because it's
so far north. But there were a lot of people out on their bikes. The Danes liked to bike
everywhere. And the city was lit up and it just felt festive. And one of the first things
Peterson pointed out as we were walking around were the government buildings. Because
if you think the U.S. has big government, you ain't seen nothing.
All the buildings in downtown Copenhagen and the royal castle, the parliament building,
the ministries, are oversized to a state like Denmark.
Oh, the buildings are too big.
Yeah, they were built for an empire. And now they exist in one of the smaller states in the
world. So they're rather huge compared to what you see, for example, in Stockholm,
what you see in Germany, what you see elsewhere.
That's so interesting.
Are they empty?
No, the welfare state took them over. But they're rather beautiful and they
symbolize an empire.
I love the idea of an empire turned into a welfare state. All this external effort
focused inward. And that welfare state, of course, fueled by those huge taxes,
means that the government provides education for everyone, health care for everyone.
Yeah, basically the government will take care of you. And one really interesting thing about
the Danish economy is that it has this mix. It's like a huge welfare state, but it also has
very free market policies when it comes to trade and other things. And for instance,
and this is what we're going to talk about today, they make it very easy to fire people.
So, you know, companies don't have to pay tons of severance. Like if the economy
takes a dip or things aren't working out, they can just let you go pretty easily.
There's a saying that I hear economists use, which if it's hard to fire people,
then it's hard to hire people. In other words, if everyone you hire, like in France or in some
sectors of Germany, when you hire a person and you know, if I ever fire this person,
I'm going to have to spend a lot of money on severance payments and it's going to take a
very long time to fire that person. I'm just not going to hire as many people. It's like
if you had to marry everyone you dated or something like that. And they talk about
labor market rigidities, meaning it's hard to hire and fire versus labor market flexibility.
And the reason economists think economies perform much better when you can fire people easily
is because that means there's just a lot more turnover. So an industry that's doing well
is just going to grow and grow and grow. There's very low cost to hiring new people.
You can sort of say, all right, I'll hire 20 people and if we fail, I'll get rid of them.
And the economy can just very quickly adjust moving people around. And so they would say
that's very good in the long run for workers. Right. Of course, if you're a worker in the
short run, you know, that might not be so fun, right, because you could lose your job.
And that is why Denmark has combined with that easy to fire policy, very,
very, very generous unemployment benefits. So in the United States, if you lose your job,
you can get six months of unemployment usually, although that's been extended now temporarily to
17 months because of the recession. But it is nothing compared to Denmark. Guess how long
Denmark gets? If you're in Denmark, you get four years of unemployment. You can collect
unemployment checks for four years. So the Danes call this whole policy flex security,
flexible meaning it's easy to fire people, security meaning there are huge unemployment
benefits. And Ove Peterson said, one result of this is you have huge turnover. People
go in and out of jobs all the time. The labor market is about 2.2 million people
and about 300,000 of these 2.2 loses their job every year. But more than 300,000 new jobs
are created every year. That shows the adaptability of this kind of an economy.
Does that mean there are people who have like a different job every few years?
A normal Danish worker, both in the public and the private sector,
changes or her jobs every fourth year.
Wow.
And you normally change your job function six to eight times in a lifespan.
So if I just stop someone on the street, they'll probably have been fired at some point,
maybe multiple times, right? And found new jobs.
Right.
That's just the way of life.
It is the way of life. And that's, that's the reason why we do have these welfare
estate. Because if it is a way of life, it's also, welfare estate is also a way to handle
that challenge.
Have you ever been fired and had to go on welfare?
No, not personally.
Your wife?
Yes, twice. She's an architect in the public sector and she's been fired twice because
of restructuring of the public sector. And that's another part of this flexibility
to have a welfare estate that can, that can ameliorate or enhance the mobility
on the labor market in general. You also have to go through
reforming the welfare estate constantly. And the Danish welfare estate has been
constantly reformulated and re-transformed at least the last 25 years.
So it's not, to be a public servant is not a guarantee against unemployment.
You are just like private, people working in the private sector,
challenged by unemployment constantly.
So the waiter standing over there through the glass, he's probably had multiple,
multiple jobs, right?
Yeah. And he will change his job within the next three or four months or so.
So does that mean it's, does it feel different to be fired? I feel like it's
incredibly traumatic in the United States when you lose your job. You know, just
because there are hard economic times, it's amazingly traumatic. Is it, is it
that way here?
No, first of all, there are no, no social stigmatization connected to being
unemployed or being fired because everybody used to, to, to, to go through
that kind of a social situation.
You know what people say in America? They say I'm between jobs. That's what
they say. They don't say I'm unemployed. They say I'm between jobs.
Here you say you're looking for a job. Yeah.
And employers like it because when they need to get rid of workers, they
can get rid of workers. It's not a big deal.
Exactly. And that's why in the, in the present situation with the economic
crisis, the unemployment rate in Denmark goes very, goes up very fast compared,
for example, to Germany that very slowly moves up there because German
companies try to keep their workers at the, in the companies, even if they
don't, even if they don't work. But in Denmark, because of the
flexible and the flexibility of the labor market, every company tried to
get rid of their labor force, not as fast as possible, but even faster than,
for example, in Germany and probably also faster in some of the other
economies around us because they know that they can get the, they can get
the work, they can get the worker back when they need them and the
worker won't lose personal income and the worker even in the period
unemployment will be retrained. So the worker coming back is more
competent than the worker going out.
I would think if I were an employer and I had some great employees,
but economic times were tough, I still might not want to get rid of them
because I worried I might lose them. I might not be able to hire them back.
Maybe they'll find some other job.
Yeah, but that's because in United States, you take for granted that
the, the competence is in the hands or in the mind of one person.
But here we take it for granted that everybody has a high level of
competencies and everybody that is, are able to move into nearly
every kind of job.
The problem with having huge unemployment benefits, at least the
story that, that a lot of economists tell is that it can really be a
drag on the overall economy. It's not just that it costs money.
Obviously it does cost money to give unemployment benefits, but,
but even worse, people who are unemployed, if it's not so painful to
be unemployed, if it's actually quite pleasant, you might spend a
lot of time unemployed. And if you have these large sectors of the
economy not working, that means lots of people not being productive.
Economists, by the way, will never use the word lazy.
I've certainly never heard them say that.
It just, it's a perfectly reasonable, rational decision.
If, if I can make good money not having to work for 40 hours a
week, why would I then work for 40 hours a week?
It's, yeah, I mean, what, what if you were getting more
in unemployment benefits than you might as a seller, right?
And you could stay home with the kids and you could fix the
door that always made noise that bothered you or whatever.
It's a perfectly rational decision.
And I wouldn't have to make more.
I could, you know, if I made a bit less, but I got all that
free time, I'd take that deal.
Right. And actually, when Denmark started this program,
there was that problem.
And I talked to a lot of people about this, including this one
student, and I'm going to let her introduce herself.
It's a very difficult name.
It's pronounced in Danish as Sine.
What's your last name?
Bull.
Bull?
Olesen.
Okay, give me the whole thing.
Sine Bull Olesen.
Okay. Do you ever look, I mean, do you ever, is there
any animosity?
Do people ever look and say that person's not really honestly
looking for a job.
They're just sort of staying at home and collecting
unemployment benefits.
Definitely, definitely, definitely.
I mean, this is another big problem.
There are always people exploiting the system.
We have, I mean, many people.
Do you have stories?
I think almost everyone knows someone who has been on
welfare and at the same time working, you know, unofficially,
working, what do you say, like in Denmark you say you work
black, but-
On the black market or something, yeah, like working on
the side, getting paid in cash.
Oh my gosh.
That's so-
That's so common.
Yeah, I would like to say no, but I do think it is.
So, you know, Ove Peterson was talking about how they
had to constantly tweak the welfare system.
One of the things they did with this problem is they put
in all these kinds of controls to make sure that
people were really trying to find a job.
When you become unemployed, you, what do you say, you don't
say you turn yourself in, but you have to tell the
authorities that you become unemployed and then you can
get, if you, we have a kind of insurance system, so you
get compensation, economic compensation, but in return
you have to send out, I believe at one point it was
10 applications per week and you had to prove that you
had sent these applications, which resulted in the
fact that, I mean, you cannot, if I were to apply
for 10 jobs a week, I cannot find 10 jobs a week
that I would be qualified to do.
So we had social workers applying for doctor jobs,
like scientists or, I mean, the craziest things, you know.
Jobs they were totally not qualified for because
they had to apply for something.
Jobs they were completely unqualified to do, just
because they had to prove in order to get this
economic compensation that they had applied for 10 jobs.
So what I keep finding fascinating about Denmark, and I
feel like the big lesson that we're trying to squeeze
out of Denmark is there are things here that seem
impossible.
This system to me, if you said, oh, I'm going
to tell you about a country, they have four years
of unemployment benefit, but you have to spend all
your time in these incredibly inefficient pursuit
of jobs that you don't even want and aren't serious
about trying to get.
I was thinking, you know, we're in the process
of hiring a blogger, for example, and we hired
our supervising editor and we had to go through
resumes.
I was just thinking, oh, my goodness, if I also
had to go through resumes of all these doctors
and bartenders and whoever else is just.
And so all of this seems so inefficient and it
just doesn't make any sense that this is in one
of the most successful economies in the world.
But what you're making me realize a little bit,
maybe I'm just throwing this out there, is that
part of the super flexibility, the ease of
hiring and firing is knowing that those people
are secure.
I've once or twice in my whole life been in a
position to at least discuss firing someone.
And we were paralyzed with upset because we
knew how hard their life would be and how
miserable it would be.
And we and I think every company has lots
and lots of people around who probably shouldn't
be there.
But the company keeps them around because they
don't want the personal pain of being
responsible for someone else's misery.
So I wonder if maybe this system does allow
more flexibility than one would think on first
blood.
Yeah.
And you could imagine there are some
economic gains, right?
If you can let people go more easily, if
it's less expensive to let people go because
you have to pay less compensation for them and
all that.
But there are definite downsides to this.
And I talked to Uwe Peterson about the
economist at Copenhagen Business School.
What is the downside to flex security?
And what do you where do you think it shows
up here?
That some people will take the opportunity to
stay unemployed because they're paid to stay
unemployed.
So they're not forced into as fast as they
should into a labor situation, into a job
situation.
So that means a slightly slower growing
economy.
There's a kind of slack in the system and
the slack always have to be controlled so to
speak.
And if you want to control these things,
you have to build a bureaucracy.
And when you build a bureaucracy, it's
very costly.
So there is a mechanism for welfare state
always growing and welfare state always
becoming bigger and bigger.
And the threat, of course, or the
challenge, of course, is that the
welfare state could become so big that
the economy could collapse because it's
so big.
Do you worry about that?
Absolutely.
This is something I talked to an economist
the other day about Denmark and was
talking about some of the stuff you told
me from your trip there.
And I said, it sounds like in a lot of
ways they've got us beat.
Maybe we should learn some lessons.
And this economist said, well, you
always have to wonder when people say,
oh, that economy is doing so much
better.
Is it sustainable?
And when you look at the economies that
at various times in the last century,
people have said, oh, that economy is
better than the U.S.
The Soviet Union for a while, they beat
us in the space race.
There was a time where it seemed like
they'd take over the world.
Japan seemed unstoppable.
And over time, you learn they don't
have the most sustainable economy.
I'm not saying that means there's no
lessons to learn here.
But I think what Ove Peterson is
telling us is there are hints, at
least, that maybe, maybe, this
system can't last forever.
I mean, that's one thing I kept
thinking about.
This system works because you have a
well-functioning economy right now,
right?
So you have a small number of people
unemployed, and it's easy to cover
their unemployment benefits.
Suppose you had a real crisis, and
that grew, and you had 50 percent of
the country unemployed.
Then you're going to have to have the
other half paying even higher taxes to
send off support.
The other half, it sort of works in
an economy where you have a few
percent unemployed or something.
But if that grows, then you start
increasing the national debt.
It could be a real problem.
Peterson said there's also this other
peril to having a big welfare state,
which is that it just kind of changes
your psychology.
I do teaching.
I'm normally lecturing and doing
research in the United States, and
there's a huge difference between the
students in the United States and
Denmark.
The Danish students are much more
laid back.
They're intelligent, they're smart,
but they are less hardworking than
the Americans.
Because why?
Because they know for a fact that
they will be paid in the end, and
there will be jobs for them in the
end, and so on, and so on.
So the individual incentive to make
the next step to really be pushing
forward is not here.
It does occur to me, David,
especially on a day like this.
I'm already expecting all the emails
saying you're beating up on
Denmark's welfare state or whatever.
I do think, I tend to think for
an economy like the U.S. or like
Denmark, you can't get everything
for free.
You can't get really generous
social services, really generous
health care, and an endlessly growing
economy, and very low unemployment.
Some of these things are costly, and
the costs will come in the form of
reduced growth, or reduced stability,
or there will be a cost to pay.
But on a day like today, with
the crisis in Haiti, I think of
that as almost like a niggling little
nuance between if we're going to be
like sort of having a debate between
the U.S. economy and the Danish
economy.
It's like, okay, we're both really
rich, not everyone, but lots and
lots of people in both economies
are doing very, very well.
I think that in a country like
Haiti, and like, frankly, most of
the countries on earth, there's a
huge amount of growth that could
come without having to pay all the
costs we're talking about.
I just thought it was worth
mentioning.
Yeah, but again, for countries
like Haiti, they have to decide
which way to go.
And for China, do they want to
build themselves more like
Denmark, or do they want to build
themselves more like the United
States?
All right, we're going to have
more on the Danish economy for
the next podcast.
We mentioned they have the highest
income tax in the world.
Adam, guess how much do you pay on
tax if you want to buy a car?
If you want to buy a car, actually,
I don't know.
It's 200 percent.
200 percent?
I was going to say 70 percent,
but that that's too high.
So I'm thinking, should I say 50
percent?
No, and it's not like they
are required to include it on the
price you see on the car.
So it's not like you go up to the,
you know, to buy it, and then
they add on, okay.
So if I, a $20,000 car here,
which might be a lower-end car,
I'd have to pay $60,000 in
Denmark for.
Yeah, that's for next time,
though.
Check out the blog,
npr.org slash money.
We're going to have some video
and reaction to the first day of
the who is to blame for the
financial crisis hearings.
So that's why they bike
everywhere.
It's not because they're just
like outdoors people.
It's because they 200 percent
tax on cars.
Of course, they're going to
bike everywhere.
And it's flat.
All right, let us know what you
think.
