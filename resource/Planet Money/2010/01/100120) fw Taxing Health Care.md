We debate the merits of the so-called "Cadillac" tax, a proposed tax tax on expensive health insurance plans. Jonathan Gruber, an economist at MIT, is a champion of the tax. He says charging consumers a bit more for pricey plans will make them think twice about rushing off to the emergency room for a swollen knee. Plus, he says it could mean a few extra dollars in your pocket. Gruber reasons that if employers are spending less on benefits, they'll put more money into paychecks. Not everyone agrees with Gruber including today's special guest. He says the tax will only make employers richer and hurt the middle class.

Of course not everyone agrees with Gruber, including today's special guest, who thinks the tax will only make employers richer and hurt the middle class.

**faster whisper:**
It will raise taxes, it will hurt Medicare, it will destroy jobs and run our nation deeper
into debt.
Hello and welcome to NPR's Planet Money.
I'm Chana Jaffee-Walt.
And I'm David Kestenbaum.
Today is Wednesday, January 20th.
That was the victor in last night's Senate race in Massachusetts, Republican Scott
Scott Brown, you heard at the top talking about the health care bill in his speech last night.
On the podcast today, we have something almost every economist loves.
And almost everyone else hates.
Well, not everyone, but a lot of people.
Okay, but first, a very dramatic Planet Money indicator, it is 52%.
Fifty-two percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for Republican Scott Brown, who,
as you heard, says he does not support the health care reform being considered
in Congress right now, and he could be the decisive vote.
Which clearly complicates things substantially for the Democrats.
Right, so there's all kinds of questions now about whether this means that Democrats
might try to go with a version that the Senate has already passed and get it through
really quickly and then modify it later.
Or whether they might force a vote on a bill before Brown gets sworn in.
Either way, they're going to need to figure out what the bill looks like.
What parts of the bill they want to take from the Senate version and what parts
they want to take from the House version.
And to do that, they need more time.
But now it's unclear if they have it.
And today on the podcast, we wanted to look at why those differences have been so hard
to reconcile, particularly one of them, one of the major rifts, the Cadillac tax.
And David, I have been kind of obsessed about this tax because it's something that
the majority of economists really love it, which is unusual for economists to love
a tax.
The Cadillac tax, it's by the way in the Senate version of the bill, it's there
to help pay for the cost of the health care bill.
The health care bills expand coverage to a lot of the people who don't have it now
under Medicaid.
And it offers subsidies, financial help to people who are not very poor but still
can't afford insurance.
Anyway, we have to pay for that somehow.
And the Senate bill proposes one of the ways to raise some money is to tax really
expensive health insurance benefits.
So the tax would be on the provider of the insurance, but it would presumably
raise the costs for the employer and then eventually for the employees also.
So the tax would be on plans that cost total, what your employer pays and you
together, more than $8,500 a year for an individual.
So Hanif say NPR pays more than $8,500 a year for your benefits.
Anything above that $8,500 would be taxed at 40%.
Labor unions hate this tax because it turns out that a lot of the people
who have those Cadillac benefits are union members, not necessarily rich
people, but people who have given up higher wages over the years for really
good health benefits, really good and really expensive health benefits and
benefits that they do not want to pay more for.
Economists like the idea, not because it raises money.
They like it because there's this quirk about the way health insurance
works in this country that they've always really, really hated.
And it's something they say encourages employers to make really weird
and bad decisions and encourages us to make bad decisions.
And that is the fact that our benefits and our healthcare benefits are not
taxed, but our wages are taxed.
Yeah, I talked to Jonathan Gruber.
He's an economist at MIT, and we talked all about this.
He is sort of the main economist out there arguing for the Cadillac tax.
And he says economists see this as a really central reason that
healthcare costs rise so quickly.
We get these really big plans that cover everything, and we don't have
to pay very much for them.
We, the workers, our employers pay a lot for them, but we don't have
to pay very much to go and get healthcare services.
And that encourages us to get too much done, to see the doctor too much.
That's been known for years to lead to excessive health insurance coverage.
That is people buy too much health insurance because it's subsidized
in this way, and ultimately to lead to higher healthcare costs.
And it's huge.
It adds up to about $250 billion a year in foregone tax revenue
that we're providing to people to subsidize them to buy excessive insurance.
What is too much health benefits?
How can you have too much health coverage?
That's a great question.
You can have too much health coverage because ultimately health coverage is not free.
So if you have health coverage that covers all your medical spending,
what we call first dollar coverage, that leads you to use healthcare
beyond the point which you need to to maintain your health.
As a result, you end up paying more for health insurance than you need to,
and we as a nation end up spending more for healthcare.
We know in America that about a third of the healthcare we deliver is not necessary.
Now, we don't quite know how to get rid of that third,
but we do know as a place to start is to make consumers recognize
the costs of consuming excess medical care.
And David, John Gruber, he is sort of the economic champion of the Cadillac tax,
but that argument, it's complicated.
No one would say it's a very sexy argument.
Economists make their points about the Cadillac tax with graphs
and with long papers and editorials with a ton of bullet points in them,
and they cannot seem to convince the public.
One reason is that the counterargument, it is so much easier to connect with.
Labor unions, they kill at making the counterargument.
They don't talk about taxes or show graphs.
They have simple, clear ads with sympathetic characters.
I have asthma, and I've had it since I was probably 10, 12 years old,
and it seems to be progressively getting worse.
My union bargained great benefits for my family and I, but it's still tough.
I pay over $1,500 a year for my medications,
and I need those medications to live.
And no, we're not rich, middle-class, average American.
We need health care reform to lower costs and make sure people are covered.
But health care reform has to be fair.
When I heard some senators wanted to tax their health care benefits,
I just couldn't believe it.
I support health care reform, but I can't afford that.
It's going to affect me.
Monthly, I'm on a budget, and it's just going to be terrible.
We need to tell the Senate that taxing benefits
is not the way to health care reform.
So we know that you all can't see that ad.
You can sort of picture this blonde woman with her two kids
in southwestern Virginia. There's mountains.
They show her with her asthma medications.
Her name is Valerie Castle Stanley.
She's an AT&T worker in southwestern Virginia,
and she is someone whose benefits would be taxed.
Her employer pays a lot for her benefits,
and they would be taxed under the Cadillac Plan.
And I told John Gruber about her.
I actually sent this ad to him, and he said,
all right, fine, I can tell personal stories, too.
The other weekend, I hurt my knee playing tennis,
and I wasn't sure if it was really hurt
or I should just stay off it for a day or two.
And I went to the emergency room, because why not?
It cost me $75. That's not much to me.
They x-rayed it. They said it's fine.
Just stay off it for a day or two.
I should have stayed off it for a day or two
before going to the emergency room.
I shouldn't have gone that day.
That's a lot of what makes medical care expensive.
But what's wrong with going that day,
the fact that the x-ray is quite expensive
and you don't actually see the cost?
Exactly. It cost me $75.
That visit probably cost my insurance company $500 to $1,000.
That's costs that they then have to pass on everyone else
and the higher price of insurance.
So, John, there are many people who hear this argument,
including our engineer here sitting on the other side
of the glass who is shaking his head angrily,
who hate the argument that people consume more health care
because they don't see cost,
that they consume more than they need,
that they intentionally go and try to spend a lot of money.
That idea makes a lot of people crazy.
What do you make of that response?
You know, I totally understand that response,
and this is why we're called the dismal science economists,
because we like to point out uncomfortable truths.
The best response I can give to that is,
while it may sound unintuitive,
there's enormous volumes of research
to support that it is true,
that basically when you charge individuals
more for their health care, they use less health care
and they're in no worse health.
And there's just time after time again
where we've cut back on the amount of health care
people get and their health is not any worse.
Now, there's limits.
If you take someone who's insured and make them uninsured,
that will affect their health, conversely.
If you take an uninsured person and make them insured,
that'll improve their health.
And I think ultimately the thing to express
to your engineer and to others
is that given the fixed pie we have to allocate,
if we have people like the woman who works for AT&T
go to the doctor a little less,
and that gives us the money to get someone
who's currently uninsured and not going at all
to go to the doctor some,
overall society is so much better off.
So David, I just have to interject here
because this whole interview was so weird.
So when we talk, John is in his house in Massachusetts
and we're talking over this phone line.
And I'm in the studio in New York and here in New York,
we have these glass walls around us
and there are engineers sitting on the other side of it
and normally they're just sitting at their board,
they're making the sound sound beautiful.
A lot of times they're not even really
listening to the content.
But this interview, John Gruber,
he's going on about how the Cadillac text is good
and my engineer, Neil Rausch,
is sitting on the other side of the glass
and he's getting all worked up
and he's waving his arms and he's shaking his head
and he can actually talk into my headphones
that John can't hear and he's telling me,
what, that doesn't make any sense,
ask him about this, ask him about this.
And at some point I just think this is the problem.
Economists make their arguments to reporters
and they make arguments in editorials and studies,
but really they have to convince everyone out there
who has health insurance,
people who pay more than they wanna pay for it already,
people go bankrupt because of healthcare costs,
they have to convince them that they want this tax.
So I'm like, eventually I'm so distracted,
I just said, Neil, just ask him yourself.
So John, this is Neil.
Hi, John. Hi, Neil.
All right, well, a couple of things, okay?
Now I'm not a reporter, I'm an engineer,
so I'm just kinda,
it's just stuff that's going through my head here.
Let me ask you a question about this thing with your knee.
Okay. Let's look,
suppose you decided to wait a couple of days, okay?
And then it turns out that the complication developed
because you didn't go right away,
making things much more expensive
besides having an effect on your health.
An example of that is my son
got hit in the eye with a soccer ball
and we were gonna wait to see the pediatrician,
this was on a weekend.
We made a call to the doctor.
Doctor said, actually you should go to the emergency room
and it turned out, as I said,
it would have been endangered had we not done that.
So maybe you should at least consult your doctor
or whoever's on call for your doctor
before you run to the emergency room
unless it's really obviously an emergency.
Maybe we could put that as a requirement.
And Neil, the point that you're making there
is if it had cost $500 for you to go immediately,
then you might not have gone.
Yeah, but we did ask the doctor, though.
And Neil, I think what we can agree
is there is a smarter way,
there is a smart way to do this,
which is you should have asked your doctor
and I should have asked my doctor,
but my doctor was programmed to just say,
go to the emergency room.
I did ask my doctor.
My doctor said, go to the emergency room
because why the hell not?
But if your doctor recognized
that there's financial implications,
then presumably when there's a risk to your eyesight,
they'd say, look, you should go,
even if it's gonna cost you $400
for the risk to your eyesight.
Whereas to me, they'd say, look,
it's your knee, it's not worth the $300,
give it a couple days.
Maybe we need to encourage doctors
to be a little more prudent with some of this now.
Exactly, absolutely.
We need to encourage doctors to be more prudent,
but the point is the only way to do that
is to invest the patient as well in the decision,
which is ultimately the only way
to control healthcare costs
to get doctors to behave differently.
But you know what?
We can't make that work
unless patients have some skin in the game.
And so once again, when it comes down to,
people say to me, why not use the House
instead of the Senate?
Look, I'd be for a healthy mix of the two,
but at the end of the day,
if we're gonna control costs in America,
we're gonna have to try some things
which may feel a little uncomfortable.
And this is one of them.
To be honest with you,
waiting around in an emergency room for hours
and paying, I don't know if it's $50 or $100
that we have to co-pay for an emergency room,
whether the doctor says to go there or not,
was enough motivation for me not to wanna go there
unless the doctor said it was necessary.
I don't need to have $500 hanging over me.
$50 is enough waiting around in an emergency room.
I don't like going to the doctor.
I don't like going to the hospital.
I don't like taking medicines
or having procedures that are unnecessary.
I don't need to have a big cost as my motivation
to avoid unnecessary care.
Right.
Look, I mean, I hear you,
but once again, here I can only point to the evidence
which says that many people are not like you
and that when you put the cost on them,
they will avoid unnecessary care.
And necessary care too.
And necessary care.
Well, once again, what's necessary?
In other words, the point is necessary care
I would define as care that affects your health.
But once again, there's studies which show
that when you put the cost on people,
their health is no worse.
They're not reducing care which is endangering their health.
I don't know anybody who thinks that way.
Well, I mean, you know,
there may not be people who thinks that way,
but that's the only evidence we have.
At this point, David John Gruber sort of says to Neil,
okay, you know, we disagree on this argument,
but even if you don't buy that argument,
I have another argument that is going to
push you over to my side.
And this is a favorite argument of economists
and it's that the Cadillac tax,
hey, it could increase your pay.
And the argument goes like this.
Basically, your employer right now pays a lot
for these expensive Cadillac health benefits,
but if the tax forces them to offer cheaper plans,
that means your employer would have extra money
for your paycheck.
This is a kind of thing where,
you know, there are a few things
which economists sort of just have a hard time
understanding why non-economists don't get
because it's so much in our blood.
But one of those is that there's a trade-off
between wages and fringe benefits,
and that trade-off works both ways.
When the cost of fringe benefits go up,
workers get paid less.
When the cost of fringe benefits go down,
workers get paid more.
You see it explicitly in union negotiations.
There's a number of examples of unions
which have said, look, we decided we'd give back
some of the health insurance
to get higher wages for our workers.
In some sense, there's no reason
it wouldn't work that way.
So at this point, Neil, our engineer again,
is waving his arms and talking to my headphones,
you know, which I mentioned to John Gruber,
saying that still, like, another point,
he is not convinced by this point.
And John proceeds to run over to his computer
in his house and say, okay, you don't believe me?
I have data.
There are studies.
Let me just print them out.
Oh, well, now the printer's going.
Just wait one minute.
How many pages is the paper?
I meant to print one, but I printed 12.
Okay, okay, so for example, as this report says,
ASCME, which is one of the big unions
that's opposed in the Cadillac tax,
has been quoted as saying,
reform reduces healthcare costs
and provides more money for wages.
Then there's a quote from
the California Federation of Teachers,
which says the healthcare cost spiral
is forcing no-win choices upon the bargaining table.
Do we negotiate a modest wage increase
but take on employee co-pays
that reduce or eliminate the wage increase
or accept flat wages in return
for keeping healthcare cost increases at bay?
Okay, and then the Madison teachers
said more money would be available for wages
if the Madison teachers switched to HMOs
that provided coverage.
So basically, even the unions
which are opposed to this admit
that there's a trade-off
and if you can get healthcare costs down,
wages will go up.
Now, can I prove that to you?
I'm reminded of a baseball player
that played for the Red Sox named Carl Everett.
Carl Everett said he didn't believe
in dinosaurs because he'd never seen one walking around.
At some level, we have to take evidence
as fact and the evidence from numerous studies
are that there is this trade-off
between health insurance costs and wages.
Are you convinced, Neil?
So the evidence that you have,
is it anything as firm as dinosaur bones?
The evidence I have is not as firm as dinosaur bones.
It's theoretical, right?
No, no, it's fact-based.
So for example, what I have is I have two types of evidence.
What I have that's most convincing
is I have a number of examples
of times where health insurance costs have gone up
and wages have gone down one for one.
Now, I realize that's different
that we're talking about here,
but I'm gonna make a sequential argument for you.
That is as close dinosaur bones
as we get in the social sciences.
I can point to you of examples
where the costs of health insurance have gone up
for a firm and they've paid their workers less, okay?
That's the first step.
It's not dinosaur bones, but it's the data equivalent.
What I don't have, I will admit,
is I don't have that kind of evidence.
For examples, I don't have those kind of facts
I can point you to
of where the cost of health insurance went down
and wages went up.
I will admit, I do not,
no one's written a really compelling study of that
because we have a pretty high standard.
And I think you need to really take into account
the power that employers have,
much more so than over employees.
And then even if they will,
let's say they lower the amount they pay
towards health benefits,
maybe they'll give some back in wages.
But I really, on a big scale,
I really doubt that's going to happen.
And Neil, why?
Why does that seem suspect to you?
Because the employers will have a great motivation
to siphon off some of that for their profits
or to lower their costs,
which they may very well have done
when they lowered wages to raise health benefits.
You know, it's hard to get exact figures from employers.
But I have also a couple of other...
Do you...
Wait, I'm sorry, John, can you just respond to that?
Yeah, but what about those union quotes, Neil?
And what about the unions essentially admitting
that they're making this trade-off
in their wage negotiations?
Well again, how much equivalency is there?
Well, I mean, you're right.
The unions are not saying one for one,
but they're basically saying more money beveled for wages
if they switch to cheaper health plans.
Right, but it may go in the other direction,
but it goes anywhere near the equivalent amount
that I really doubt.
And it depends on the power of a particular union,
which are much weaker than they've been in the past.
Hannah, I think listening to that
and looking at Neil again through the glass here,
I think he was not satisfied.
He was cheering his own side.
Yeah, he's still shaking his head
when John Gruber talks.
And the point that Neil kept asking is,
what if John Gruber is wrong?
What if we have this tax
and middle-class people have to pay more
for health benefits and they don't get it back in wages?
But John Gruber says,
okay, even if he's wrong about the wages argument,
there are still really good things in the tax.
If I'm right and it goes to wages, it's a win-win.
If I'm wrong, it doesn't go to wages,
then you're right.
The woman in Northern Virginia will pay more tax.
But in society, if we wanna help the uninsured,
we gotta raise the money somehow.
So Neil, are you at all convinced?
You know, like I said, I don't run to the doctor.
Oh, it's only $15.
I think I'll go to the doctor today.
I think that's absurd.
I don't know anybody who does that,
who runs to the doctor.
If anything, people just don't wanna go
because they just don't like it.
John, are you at all convinced
by anything Neil is saying?
I mean, I think it's been a very helpful conversation.
I wouldn't say I've convinced
in terms of changing what I believe to be true.
I think we're often too glib on things we believe deeply.
And I think Neil's pointed a very helpful way
for me to make my point,
which is to say that I believe
this can result in higher wages,
and so it's really a win-win.
But to understand, but I think what I would do
to appeal to people who don't
and just don't agree with that,
which is a fine position to hold,
is that look, the other thing people are complaining about
with this bill is that it doesn't do enough
for cost control.
And if we're going to control costs,
we're gonna have to take on some difficult issues.
And this is one of them.
The only tool to control costs
that's actually been endorsed
by the official government scores
that I think given the importance of cost control
in this bill, it should be part of the package.
Neil, is that helpful?
You know, we'll see.
Hannah, you did not make peace.
No, ma'am, but you know,
Congress has not figured this out yet either.
So the fact that Planet Money failed
to make peace between these two minds,
I think is not the end of the world.
Let us know if you are convinced.

Thank you for listening.
Keep riding, cost sliding.
That's cool, cause I'm Cadillac camping.
