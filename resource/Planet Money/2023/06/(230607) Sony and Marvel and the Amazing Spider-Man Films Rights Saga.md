(Note: This episode originally ran in 2022.)

This past weekend, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse had the second largest domestic opening of 2023, netting (or should we say webbing?) over $120 million in its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada. But the story leading up to this latest Spider-Man movie has been its own epic saga.

When Marvel licensed the Spider-Man film rights to Sony Pictures in the 1990s, the deal made sense — Marvel didn't make movies yet, and their business was mainly about making comic books and toys. Years later, though, the deal would come back to haunt Marvel, and it would start a long tug of war between Sony and Marvel over who should have creative cinematic control of Marvel's most popular superhero. Today, we break down all of the off-screen drama that has become just as entertaining as the movies themselves.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
The biggest superhero blockbuster of 2023
is not Marvel's newest Ant-Man movie.
It is also not Marvel's newest Guardians
of the Galaxy movie.
No, no.
It is the newest Spider-Man movie.
What's a guy gotta do to join this spider team?
You can never be part of this.
All stations, stop Spider-Man!
Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse
made $120 million last weekend in the U.S.,
making it the biggest comic book movie opening of the year,
but notably a comic book movie
that was not made by Marvel Studios,
the biggest, most successful superhero movie company
in history.
Nope, because Marvel does not own the film rights
to its own most popular character.
Sony Pictures owns the spider rights.
And a while ago, we dedicated an entire episode
to the surprisingly epic saga of Sony and Marvel
and the Spider-Man film rights.
Today, we're going to rerun that episode
because this new movie success
kind of redefines what our original story meant.
Yeah, so this new across the Spider-Verse movie,
it is an animated film.
It's the sequel to that Miles Morales
into the Spider-Verse movie.
But before these Spider-Verse movies,
all of the big, expensive Spider-Man blockbusters
were live action movies
where an actual human actor had to, you know,
put on an actual Spider-Man costume or whatever.
Yeah, and that is why in our Planet Money episode,
we are only talking about the live action movies.
But at the very end, we're going to come back
and explain how these new animated movies
are like the perfect surprise Hollywood ending
to that original episode.
Okay, here's the original episode.
Marvel Studios now makes
some of the biggest movies in the world,
but that is a relatively new business model for Marvel.
For most of its history, Marvel was a company
that sold paper or plastic to people,
paper comic books or plastic toys.
Selling physical retail products
was the Marvel business model.
And you know, that arguably started to change
a little bit in 1993.
This is when Marvel Films was created,
not to make movies, but to license Marvel superheroes
so other companies could make movies.
The idea was that Marvel would go find
some big Hollywood studio.
That studio would pay Marvel some money
to use a superhero and then make
a big, expensive superhero movie.
Which conveniently would also be like
a big, expensive superhero commercial
for Marvel's comics and toys,
the real Marvel business, back in the 90s.
And so, licensing superheroes to movie studios
was this low-risk, no-brainer for Marvel.
And license they did.
To 20th Century Fox,
Marvel licensed the movie rights to the X-Men.
Mutant and proud.
Chin-chin.
To Universal Pictures, the Hulk.
And to Sony Pictures,
went Marvel's most popular superhero of all.
I will never forget these words.
Spider-Man.
With great power comes great responsibility.
Our episode today is born from this Spider-Man
movie deal made around the year 2000
between Marvel and Sony Pictures.
And the basic details of the deal are this.
Sony would pay Marvel $10 million
for every Spider-Man movie that Sony wanted to make.
Marvel would get 5% of the movie revenue.
Sony and Marvel would split money
from the Spider-Man movie toys.
It was the right business decision in the moment.
Marvel didn't make movies.
They sold comic books and toys.
What do they need the Spider-Man film rights for?
Of course, later, they may regret this decision.
And this is what we shall henceforth call
the Spider-Man problem.
The Spider-Man problem is not unique to Marvel.
Any company can make the right decision in the moment
without knowing the mess it will create in the future.
It just so happens,
Spider-Man turned into a particularly entertaining mess.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Wayland Wong.
And I'm Kenny Malone.
Now, perhaps you've heard there's a new Spider-Man movie
in theaters and it has earned,
look up the box office numbers here,
all of the money, $1.7 billion and counting.
But for Planet Money's purposes,
the bigger Spider-Man story has been happening
off screen for the past 20 years.
It has questionable contracts, international espionage,
and exactly one food fight.
Today on the show, we untangle the Spider-Man problem.
You will never see a Spider-Man movie the same way again.

If you're a casual movie watcher,
it maybe feels like there's been a new Spider-Man movie
every other year for the last 20 years.
And that's because there has been on average.
Yeah, so many Spider-Man movies
starring so many different Spiders-Man, Spider-Men.
Who am I?
First, we got Tobey Maguire.
I'm Spider-Man.
Then there were some Andrew Garfield movies.
Hey, my name is Spider-Man.
You can call me Webhead.
You can call me Amazing.
And now we are in the Tom Holland era.
I mean, I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.
Please, you've been to space.
Untangling the Spider-Man problem
will help explain why it feels like Spider-Man
keeps starting over and over and over again.
And to do this, we have brought in
my personal favorite Marvel expert.
What is the nerdiest Spider-Man fact that you love?
Originally, Spider-Man was not gonna be
a Spider-based hero.
What?
Stan Lee wanted to make him a fly, so.
But the, so Fly-Man?
Fly-Man.
This is Joanna Robinson.
She's senior writer and podcaster over at The Ringer.
And yes, apparently a literal fly on the wall
inspired Stan Lee to eventually create Spider-Man.
I think Spider-Man is a really good way
to take a tour of the history of Marvel Studios.
And this is his own little Marvel drama.
But the McGuffin is not Infinity Stone.
It's poor Peter Parker.
Yeah, that's right.
And so with Joanna's help, we are gonna go
Spider-Man by Spider-Man to tell this bigger story.
We pick up that story in 1999,
which is when Marvel and Sony strike their Spider-Man deal.
Sony Pictures gets to work,
and about three years later,
they have their first Spider-Man movie ready to go,
starring Tobey Maguire.
All right, here we go.
Okay.
Can you see, you can see my screen okay?
Yeah.
Look at little baby Tobey Maguire.
Hey, so tiny.
Can I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
Sure, yeah.
Now, important backstory here.
Hollywood wisdom for basically all of time
said that to become box office hits,
movies need superstars.
Like maybe Sony would need Leonardo DiCaprio
to play Spider-Man.
I would not have minded seeing a Leo Spider-Man.
However, Sony went a different direction.
They instead hired Tobey Maguire.
And this was a bit of a gamble
because he was not a superstar in 2002.
Whalen, feel free to disagree.
I know you have strong Tobey Maguire feelings.
No?
I just think Cider House Rules is like a major movie.
Okay, sure.
He had been in that, but he was not Leo.
And yet, everyone, probably including Leo,
went and saw Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man movie anyway.
Thanks.
And there's the spider, and there's the bite.
And we have a bite.
The telltale bite.
And I know that there have been
a million origin stories since,
and so it might all seem kind of-
We're gonna get into that.
We're gonna get into that.
Yeah, it might seem kind of rote.
But I think it's really interesting
in terms of not being afraid
to lean into what makes that comic book appealing,
which for Spider-Man is sort of a wholesome,
real story about a real kid.
Really, it is that first Spider-Man,
which makes a mind-boggling amount of money.
It really does change and kick off something new,
a new wave.
Sure, there had been superhero movies before,
but Spider-Man kicks off a new magnitude of thing.
It makes double what any other superhero movie
had made before.
$800 million, and again,
starring a not-very-famous actor.
All of this revealed a massive change
happening in Hollywood.
That old industry axiom that you need superstars,
maybe that did not apply to superhero movies.
Maybe the real star of a Spider-Man movie
is Spider-Man, the character,
the intellectual property, the IP.
We are moving out of the era of movie stars.
It no longer makes sense for studios
to have sort of a resonant movie star
or to what becomes king as IP over stars.
Is Marvel mad at this point?
What are you thinking if you're Marvel
as Spider-Man is ascending
to the ranks of superhero greatness?
I don't know if I would say mad,
but I do think that this example of Spider-Man
of like, okay, sure,
we're making plenty of money off the toys,
but think of, oh, look at this box office.
Why aren't we getting any of this money,
or more of this money, et cetera?
I imagine in a boardroom somewhere,
this is about the moment Marvel starts to realize
they have created the Spider-Man problem.
Back when they sold the Spider-Film rights,
they were just a company
that sold comic books and toys,
but now it seemed like the better business
was actually making superhero movies.
And if so, then maybe selling away the movie rights
to your most popular characters,
maybe not the greatest idea, in hindsight.
But Sony Pictures did have the rights,
and of course, they kept making movies.
They had two more Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies,
one great, one less great.
And then, in 2012,
Sony introduced a completely new Spider-Man.
You a cop?
Really?
You seriously think I'm a cop?
Andrew Garfield.
Pop in a skin-tight red and blue suit.
You know, you're, you're, you're.
Now, I feel like it was this Andrew Garfield movie
where the general public started to wonder,
wait, is there more to this Marvel-Sony deal
than we know about,
because this Spider-Man movie
appeared to be the same Spider-Man movie
we had already seen.
We had to watch Peter Parker get bit by a spider again.
We had to watch his poor uncle Ben die again.
And then we had to watch Peter learn
how to, like, use webs and sling and stuff again.
It was like Sony had forgotten
it already made a bunch of Tobey Maguire movies.
Why does this film exist?
I mean-
Angry fans took to the web cams.
It's Spider-Man.
We're Sony.
Just write whatever.
So I'm giving this terrible movie a two out of 10.
It was confusing.
Yes.
To, like, to me, to the general public.
Yes.
Like, what is happening here?
Yeah, and again, I am defensive
of the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man,
but I remember being in a bar
across the street from a movie theater
as we were about to go watch The Amazing Spider-Man.
And a friend of mine, he asked me, he's like, why?
Why are we getting Andrew Garfield Spider-Man?
We just said goodbye to Tobey.
What's happening?
And I said, yeah, in order to keep the rights,
they have to keep making them
in a timely clip-clop fashion.
For Sony to keep the Spider-Man rights,
they apparently have to keep making Spider-Man movies
per the contract.
Here's a part of the Sony Marvel contract.
I'm gonna read.
I'm gonna hate you with some contract verbiage.
Oh, this is it for us.
We love reading from a contract.
All right, let's lay it on us, Joanna.
All right.
Sony must commence production on a new Spider-Man film
within three years, nine months,
and release it within five years, nine months
after the release of Proceeding Picture.
Boom.
Translation, if Sony does not release a Spider-Man movie
every five years and nine months,
the movie rights go back to Marvel.
And Sony loses one of the most valuable pieces
of intellectual property in the world, question mark?
Hard to fact check, I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
So if you've wondered why there always seems
to be a Spider-Man movie,
it's because there kind of has to be one
if Sony wants to keep the rights.
And does this go on for eternity?
Yes.
What?
This is the contract.
This is what, this is the devil's bargain
that Marvel's made with Sony.
I remember what made the Spider-Man problem
seem particularly bad was that at the exact same time
the sad, confusing Andrew Garfield Spider-Man came out,
the following movie also came out.
Call it, Captain.
All right, listen up.
Stark, you've got the perimeter.
Thor, you gotta try and bottleneck that portal.
And Hulk.
Smash.
Marvel's Avengers.
Yes, Marvel, of course, had started making movies
and now their superheroes were in a movie together
fighting bad guys in New York City where Spider-Man lives.
But Spider-Man could not be there to help,
which only made sense if you understood
the eternal, legal, contractual Spider-Man problem
Marvel had created for itself.
After the break, Marvel tries to solve
its eternal problem and gets in a food fight.
A literal food fight.
In 2005, Marvel took out a giant loan from Merrill Lynch
to start Marvel Studios, to start making its own movies.
The problem for Marvel was at this point,
they had licensed out most of their best characters.
Spider-Man, of course,
as we talked about for the past 10 minutes,
but also X-Men, Fantastic Four, gone.
And so Marvel Studios was built
from the Benchwormer superheroes.
Easy to forget now, but Iron Man, Thor, Ant-Man,
these were not breakout comic book stars.
No, Marvel Studios turned them into giant stars
by making amazing movies.
And as Marvel Studios got more powerful
and then it was purchased by Disney,
it has been able to bring back home its other characters.
For example, the movie studio that was sitting
on the X-Men and Fantastic Four rights,
Disney just bought that studio, problem solved.
It's really just Spider-Man out there swinging in the wind
that Marvel wants to bring home.
One final toy that they lent around the neighborhood
and they just are still knocking on the door saying,
Jimmy, can I have my toy back?
And the story of how Marvel
did kind of get Spider-Man back is a doozy.
This is where the food fight happens.
And just to set the scene here, the year is 2014.
Marvel is making tons of movies that people love,
though it certainly does suck
that Spider-Man cannot show up in those movies
because Sony has the rights.
And to keep those rights,
Sony is stuck rebooting Spider-Man like Sisyphus.
The confusing Andrew Garfield movie does not do great.
The sequel to it does even less great.
Marvel starts to wonder,
maybe, maybe now is our moment
to try and get a little control back over Spider-Man.
A couple of names we have to introduce here.
Number one, Marvel's big important movie producer,
Kevin Feige.
Kevin Feige calls an emergency meeting over at Marvel
to say, okay, what if we got Spider-Man back?
What would we do with him?
Feige goes off to meet with Sony Pictures,
which, not unusual, he often went to talk strategy
with the big important movie producer
over there, Amy Pascal.
Spider-Man played a big part
in the fact that Amy Pascal rose up the ranks at Sony.
Her association with Spider-Man
was a part of her career's legacy.
And so Amy Pascal sits down with Kevin Feige
over lunch, sandwiches are ordered in in her office,
I believe it is.
She talks to him and she's like,
okay, what are we gonna do next?
We would like to keep going with this current arrangement.
How's that gonna play out?
And Kevin basically said, that doesn't work for us.
This doesn't work for us anymore.
And then Kevin Feige basically says to Amy Pascal,
we know that you technically have the rights to Spider-Man,
we're not disputing that,
but Marvel is very good at making superhero movies now.
Maybe you should let us
make the next Spider-Man movie for you.
Amy Pascal has recently described
her emotions here as resentful.
She says she cried
and she threw a sandwich at Kevin Feige.
Did you say she threw a sandwich?
She threw a sandwich at Kevin Feige in this moment.
Listen, I've never thrown a sandwich at someone,
but maybe I would if they came in
and told me that I wasn't doing a good enough job
with this kid they asked me to babysit.
I hope it wasn't a hot sandwich.
We don't know, though Amy Pascal
has confirmed this story.
But look at this from Sony's perspective.
Giving Marvel creative control is embarrassing.
It's publicly admitting that they need help,
which maybe is the kind of thing you'd say privately,
maybe in some emails to your colleagues,
not the kind of thing you really want
getting out in the public.
Tonight Sony Pictures is fighting back
against what they say is a brazen attack
on their computer systems.
Yeah, Sony got hacked and lots of private thoughts
and private information were suddenly very public.
And for Joanna Robinson,
covering entertainment at the time,
this was a humongous story.
It was just, oh my God.
You know, I was at home.
It was like, is this real?
Yeah. Oh my God, this is real.
The best theory is that North Korea targeted Sony
because of a Seth Rogen movie.
Which is still one of the strangest sentences
that is ever said out loud.
And the hackers leaked all kinds of very important
and very embarrassing Sony emails.
And these emails gave us a peek inside Sony
and revealed that being the Spider-Man movie company
was not always amazing.
Yeah, for starters,
the emails showed that Sony was jealous of Marvel.
Like they had watched Marvel Studios
build a whole cinematic universe
where superheroes can cross over into each other's movies
and fans now expected that kind of thing.
But Sony was not in a position to offer it.
In one of Amy Pascal's leaked emails,
she basically says,
all I have is Spider-Man, his enemies,
his relatives, and his girlfriend.
How am I supposed to build a whole universe out of that?
Also in the leaked emails,
we learned that Sony had been looking to create a universe
out of the non-Spider-Man intellectual property
that it did have, but.
They've got Ghostbusters.
Okay.
They've got Men in Black.
Okay, they've got Men in Black in 2014, sure.
And I don't know if you recall,
but 21 Jump Street was a thing.
So we start reading about all these bizarre plans
that they have, Men in Black
in the Ghostbusters firehouse,
or 21 Jump Street and Men in Black.
How can we mix and match these various IPs?
Oh no.
It's so sad. It's tough.
So the hack made Sony look desperate at best,
incompetent at worst.
Yes, and one other huge thing the hack did
was confirm these rumors that had been circulating.
Not everybody knew about the sandwich throwing incident,
but there had been whispers
that Marvel was trying to bring Spider-Man
back into the Marvel universe,
and these emails seemed to show it.
The fans of the world catch wind of this idea
that Marvel wants to get more involved in Spider-Man.
And so that pushes some pressure on Sony,
because all of a sudden, the fandom's like,
well, of course.
Of course we want that.
Oh boy.
The flagship character.
Cue the fandom and their webcam.
Sony, from all reports, has no clue
what they're doing with this franchise.
Give the rights back to Marvel Studios,
who actually cares about their characters.
For me, that's the dream.
So fan pressure is mounting on Sony.
Meanwhile, Marvel would still really like
to bring Spider-Man back home, somehow.
And so Marvel goes back to Sony
with what sounds like a variation on the original deal,
basically saying, look, again,
we know you're not gonna give up the Spider-Man rights,
but we are here to help you make Spider-Man movies.
We can co-parent him.
Collaborate on your next movie,
and we, Marvel, will barely even take any of the money.
Marvel puts the full production force
behind making Spider-Man films,
and only takes 5% back for themselves.
And Sony gets 95%.
I'm gonna go ahead and call it a bad deal with Sony.
It's a great deal for all of us.
It's a great deal for Sony.
Technically a bad deal for Marvel,
and that is how this deal gets made,
is they take a bad deal.
But it was a deal that cracked open the door,
just a little,
to bringing Spider-Man home into the Marvel Universe.
It was a pretty clever solution.
Marvel would let some of its characters
show up and hang out in a Sony Spider-Man movie,
which is good for Sony because they're desperate
to create a bigger universe for Spider-Man.
And then in return, Sony agreed to let Spider-Man show up
like a kind of guest star in at least one Marvel movie.
Together, they find a new actor to play Spider-Man,
our final Spider-Man, Tom Holland.
And the way that we met this new Spider-Man
was very fun because it was in a movie trailer.
His job.
Now notably, this trailer is for
Captain America, Civil War, a Marvel movie trailer.
Previously, legally, no Spider-Man allowed here.
And at the very end of this trailer,
we get a close-up of Iron Man, who says...
Run out of patience.
On to Roos!
And the webbing comes out,
and Spidey drops onto this, you know,
and you hear Tom Holland's adorable
sort of like squeaky voice or whatever.
Hey everyone.
What's people's reaction when this happens?
Is this a big deal?
Oh my God!
This is the biggest deal of all time.
People lost their mind.
It's Spider-Man!
They showed this to...
Yeah, it's happening, it's happening.
The new Spider-Man movie in theaters,
the one that's making preposterous amounts
of money right now, that is a Tom Holland Spider-Man,
part of this new Sony Marvel co-parenting agreement.
And part of the appeal of the movie
is this whole strange Sony Marvel history.
This is not a spoiler,
but one of the co-stars of the new Spider-Man movie
is a Marvel character, Doctor Strange,
even though technically this Spider-Man movie
is a Sony movie.
Lots of fans know that it is a minor miracle
we are seeing two studios
share their most valuable currency,
their intellectual property.
One movie studio allowing one of its characters
to be used by another movie studio in their movie.
How strange is this?
Bizarre.
I was trying to look through to see
if there were other instances of this,
and you've got alien and predator,
there's got some various things,
but nothing touches this.
Here is where the Spider-Man deal stands.
Sony still has the film rights.
Marvel worked with Sony
on the three Tom Holland Spider-Man movies,
but they are Sony movies.
You won't find them on Disney+.
Remember, Disney owns Marvel.
However, Sony let Spider-Man show up
in three Marvel movies.
Captain America Civil War,
Avengers Infinity War, Avengers Endgame.
Those are Marvel movies,
are on Disney+.
It is a little all over the place.
Spider-Man is now a little bit
like the child of separated parents.
It is not always easy on Spider-Man.
There have been negotiations between Sony and Marvel
and complete splits and renegotiations,
but so far they've always worked things out.
For the Spider-Kid.
Was selling Spider-Man the worst, dumbest thing
in the world in the end for Marvel?
I think you want my answer to be yes,
but I just think it's no.
I think no because I just think the landscape
was so different for them then
that it's just like it was a smart deal at the time.
How can we look back on the things
that we did 20 years ago
and say it was the dumbest thing we ever did
when the landscape was so different at the time?
For now, the solution to Marvel's Spider-Man problem
is this like wonderfully bizarre intellectual property dance
between two gigantic companies.
It is a dance that as long as there's money to be made,
I think we may be watching For Eternity.
Okay, it's Waylon and Kenny in the year 2023 again.
And you know how sometimes in a movie
they'll replay a moment,
but from a totally different perspective
that sort of changes everything?
We're gonna do that for a second.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
So the moment we're gonna rerun
is when Sony is in the depths of despair.
Marvel Studios is rising.
It's redefining cinema by having all of its superheroes
cross over and hang out in each other's movies.
And meanwhile, at Sony,
there was that leaked email from Amy Pascal
that said basically all I have is Spider-Man,
his enemies, his relatives, and his girlfriend.
How am I supposed to build a whole universe out of that?
Yeah, you could sort of see what she means, I guess,
because Sony has the rights to this one really famous
Peter Parker Spider-Man.
And then I guess technically they do also have the rights
to like a mishmash of bench warmer versions
of Spider-Man as well that had been created over time.
For example, Sony had Spider-Lizard,
which is basically a crocodile in a Spider-Man costume
who only ever spoke the words Spider-Lizard.
They also had Man-Spider, which is Spider-Man,
but further mutated into Half-Man, Half-Spider monster.
And then Sony also had the Spider Amoeba,
which was created when someone mixed Spider-Man blood
into a clone of a guy named Randy.
Yeah, you know, it's not the Avengers.
And when we talked to Joanna Robinson about all this,
she said, it's funny, you can see all these weird names
laid out in excruciating legal detail
when you look at Sony's Spider-Man rights contracts.
And in them, you can see the list of characters
that they have access to.
And there's a lot of Spider-Man permutations,
there's a lot of villains,
and then all of Spider-Man's relatives
and stuff like that, so.
So yeah, technically Sony does have access to this list
upwards of 1,540 supporting characters, villains,
and Spider-Man permutations.
And for years, it appears that Sony looked at that list
and thought, I don't know,
let's do Peter Parker origin story again.
But at some point, someone finally realizes,
oh wait, maybe there's a way to go further with the story.
Maybe to build a universe out of just Spider-Man,
what Sony needed to do
was start using all those weird spider people.
They just needed a way to bring them
all into the same story.
And this, Joanna Robinson says,
this was the genius of Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse,
that animated movie that seemed to come out of nowhere
five years ago.
It introduces the concept of the multiverse,
which is a bunch of different dimensions
stacked on top of each other.
And when you look at that list of characters
that they have access to,
if you're thinking multiversally,
all of a sudden, the options are endless.
Hey guys.
Who are you?
I'm Gwen Stacy.
I'm from another dimension.
How many more spider people are there?
Then you got a team, a team of spider people.
Into the Spider-Verse had a film noir version of Spider-Man.
Hey fellas.
Is he in black and white?
Hanging out with an anime version of Spider-Man.
Hi guys.
This could literally not get any weirder.
Hanging out with a pig version of Spider-Man.
It can get weirder.
My name is Peter Parker.
Plus, this movie seemed to finally recognize
that some of these non Peter Parker versions
of Spider-Man were in fact amazing.
The Miles Morales version of Spider-Man of course.
Mr. Morales, moving in the dark.
You're late again.
Einstein said time is relative, right?
Maybe I'm not late.
Maybe you guys are early.
Sorry, it was just so quiet.
And then Spider-Gwen,
who comes from a different version of Earth,
where Gwen Stacy,
who is typically written as a
supporting love interest character,
gets to be a spider-bitten superhero.
Yeah, yeah.
Now, in this newest Spider-Verse movie
that's making all the money,
it's got even more Miles and even more Spider-Gwen
and even more weird spider people hanging out together.
And $120 million last weekend seems to suggest
that Sony has finally figured it out.
And perhaps even learned a thing or two from Marvel.
You know, that Sony can also construct
a whole cinematic universe out of a mishmash
of what appeared to just be
a bunch of bench warmer superheroes.
Who all happen to be wearing weird Spider-Man uniforms.
Exactly.
