Ivan Lozano Ortega was in charge of Bogota's wildlife rescue center back in the 90s, when he started getting calls from the airport to deal with... frogs. Hundreds of brightly colored frogs.

Most of these frogs were a type called Oophaga lehmanni. Bright red and black, and poisonous. Ivan and his colleagues weren't prepared for that. They flooded one of their offices to make it humid enough for the frogs. They made makeshift butterfly nets to catch bugs to feed them.

"It was a 24 hour [a day] job at that time," he says. "And the clock was ticking."

The frogs were dying, and Oophaga lehmanni was already a critically endangered species. But the calls kept coming, more and more frogs discovered at the airport, left by smugglers.

"Somebody is depleting the Colombian forests of these frogs," he says. "This is a nightmare. This is something that is going to make this species become extinct. Something has to be done."

Ivan had stumbled upon the frog black market. Rare frogs like Oophaga lehmanni can sell for hundreds of dollars. They are taken right out of the Colombian rainforest by poachers and smuggled overseas, where they're sold to collectors, also known as "froggers." Froggers keep these rare frogs as pets.

According to the biologists who study the Oophaga lehmanni, smugglers have taken an estimated 80,000 frogs out of the Anchicayá Valley in Colombia, the only spot on the planet where you can find them. Today, there are probably less than 5,000 of them left.

Ivan says that part of what has made this frog so special for collectors is that they're rare.

"If you have any kind of good that is rare and difficult to find, difficult to purchase, you will meet, probably, a very high price for that, like a diamond," he says.

These rare frogs are what is known as a "Veblen good" — a good that, as it gets more expensive, demand paradoxically increases, rather than decreases. Ivan decided he couldn't end the demand for these rare frogs, but he could do something about the supply.

Today on the show, how Ivan tries to put an end to the smuggling of the Oophaga lehmanni by breeding and selling them legally. And he learns that using textbook economics plays out differently in the real world.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

STAN ALCORN, HOST:

It was around 9:30 at night on a Sunday in 1998. Ivan Lozano Ortega is at his house in Bogota, Colombia, and he's getting ready to go to sleep when he gets a call.

IVAN LOZANO ORTEGA: We are calling from the Bogota International Airport. I'm with the police, and we just found a bag full of frogs.

SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST:

A bag full of frogs.

LOZANO ORTEGA: And I say, OK.

ALCORN: The reason they called Ivan is that Ivan was in charge of Bogota's Wildlife Rescue Center. It was, like, this exotic animal orphanage where people would send animals that somebody, for some reason, had taken out of the wild.

LOZANO ORTEGA: We were used to receive a monkey, a parrot and a turtle per day.

GONZALEZ: Yeah, they'd get turtles, monkeys - one time, they even got a bear. And they were kind of like, OK, yeah, sure, we can handle a bear.

LOZANO ORTEGA: You can feed a bear. I mean, it's easy to feed a bear.

ALCORN: But they weren't prepared, apparently, for frogs. And it was a lot of frogs. The police told them there were, like, 400.

LOZANO ORTEGA: And I was like - what? 400? What kind of frogs? They say, oh, those ones that are really, really nice and good looking. They're very - they have very bright colors and stuff like that. And I was like, oh, my God, those are poison frogs. What I'm going to do with that?

GONZALEZ: Most of them were a type of frog called Oophaga lehmanni. They're bright red and black. They kind of look like they're permanently wet - and, yeah, poisonous.

LOZANO ORTEGA: So it was, like, mind-blowing. We were not really expecting that.

ALCORN: Did you say, no, we can't do that? Like, what did you say back?

LOZANO ORTEGA: No, I just thought to myself. We - at that time, we were young, and these challenges were enriching, you know? We were like, it's going to hurt, but we are going to do our best.

GONZALEZ: Ivan tells the police, meet me at the rescue center. Bring the frogs. I'll be right there.

ALCORN: And the first thing Ivan has to do is he's got to make these frogs comfortable. And the frogs - they're really particular. They like it hot, and they like it wet.

LOZANO ORTEGA: So we had to flood one of the offices - put a lot of water on the floor.

ALCORN: You flooded the office?

LOZANO ORTEGA: We had to flood it - close all doors, put a heater and raise the temperature and raise the humidity to 90%.

GONZALEZ: Sounds cozy. The staff has to work outside under a tent. They're using makeshift butterfly nets to catch, like, bugs in the park to feed the frogs. But the frogs are really picky, and they keep rejecting their park bugs because they don't like park bugs. They like rainforest bugs.

ALCORN: At one point, one of the frogs breaks loose, and Ivan picks it up with his bare hand without thinking. And then his finger starts to swell up from the poison.

LOZANO ORTEGA: It was a strange because you never see veins on a finger.

ALCORN: Did you call a doctor? Were you...

LOZANO ORTEGA: No, I had to - I didn't have time for that. I - it was 24-hour kind of job at that time, and the clock was ticking.

GONZALEZ: The frogs were dying. Ivan says they were dying like flies, and there are not a lot of these frogs in the wild. They are critically endangered, and now Ivan was responsible for a whole bunch of them.

LOZANO ORTEGA: It's a huge responsibility. It's like you got a box of panda bears, and these frogs are dying on your hands.

ALCORN: A few weeks later, Ivan gets another call from the airport.

LOZANO ORTEGA: There's another 300 frogs here.

ALCORN: Then another call - more frogs.

LOZANO ORTEGA: And we were like - what is going on? Somebody is depleting the Colombian forest of these frogs. This is a nightmare. This is something that is going to make the species become extinct. Something has to be done.

(SOUNDBITE OF NATHAN FOREMAN AND SEBASTIAN BARNABY ROBERTSON'S "I DON'T DO GOSSIP")

GONZALEZ: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sarah Gonzalez.

ALCORN: And I'm Stan Alcorn. I've been reporting in Colombia, where these poisonous frogs have been getting poached and smuggled out of the country.

GONZALEZ: Today on the show, Ivan has a plan to outsmart the smugglers. He wants to flood the frog market and drive the smugglers out of business.

ALCORN: And to see how that plan is going, we hike to the one tiny spot in the world where these special frogs live, deep in the Colombian rainforest.

(SOUNDBITE OF NATHAN FOREMAN AND SEBASTIAN BARNABY ROBERTSON'S "I DON'T DO GOSSIP")

ALCORN: When Ivan was a kid, he dreamed of running a zoo. He spent hours just flipping through pages of a wildlife encyclopedia. He could never pick just one favorite animal.

GONZALEZ: But when he grew up and started working in animal conservation, he decided that his favorite animals would be all of the endangered ones.

LOZANO ORTEGA: In the beginning, I wanted to protect all the animals, but it was impossible. I didn't have the money to work with, like, something, like, big, like a jaguar or a deer or something like that - not even a bird.

GONZALEZ: But after he got that bag full of smuggled frogs from the airport, the Oophaga lehmanni frogs, something clicked. These cute, little, red-and-black-striped frogs - they were small. They were manageable. They were in his country - in Colombia.

ALCORN: Ivan thinks, maybe this is a species I could save from extinction.

LOZANO ORTEGA: I wanted to do something during my lifetime - not just starting something that somebody else could finish.

ALCORN: Now, to actually save this animal, Ivan would have to take on the smugglers.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. People were ripping these frogs from the forest and smuggling them out of Colombia through the Bogota airport to sell them to people overseas - to people who love these frogs so much that they want to keep them as pets. Like, you know how there are cat people and snake people? Well, there are frog people, and they call themselves froggers (ph).

ALCORN: And among the froggers, Ivan's frog, the Oophaga lehmanni, has become particularly treasured.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: In this box right here is, quite literally, gold. How is that possible? It's just a cardboard box. No, no.

ALCORN: This is a video of a guy unboxing Oophaga lehmanni frogs.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This is $65,000 worth of frogs from Colombia.

ALCORN: To be clear, the frogs in the video were not smuggled. Generally, people who buy smuggled goods don't brag about it on YouTube. But that is what was happening to the Oophaga lehmanni. And to understand how this little creature became something that froggers were breaking the law to own, I wanted to travel up the smuggled frog supply chain - up a rough dirt road along the Anchicaya River...

(SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)

ALCORN: ...To the only place in the world where this frog lives...

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)

ALCORN: ...A few square miles of rainforest in the middle of the Andes Mountains in Colombia.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHIRPING)

ALCORN: It's super remote - no phone service, just, like, 10 houses nearby. And to find one of these frogs, I'd need to follow a stream deep into the jungle. So I went with an expert - a local guide who knows this rainforest. Her name's Lucely Lopez.

LUCELY LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: Lucely says, "this is my university."

The jungle is really steep. I can barely keep up with her.

Oof (ph). Not ideal for hiking.

At some points we're moving just inches at a time. It's like trying to swim through tree branches.

We are in the middle of a plant. We can barely move.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHETE CLANGING)

ALCORN: Lucely has to break out her machete.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHETE CLANGING)

ALCORN: But finally, 2 1/2 hours in...

LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: ...Lucely hears one of the frogs calling.

LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: She says there's one nearby. And to keep the frog singing, Lucely does a kind of frog call.

LOPEZ: (Imitating Oophaga lehmanni song).

ALCORN: We're trying to follow the frog's song. But the frog goes quiet, so we try playing a recording of a real Oophaga lehmanni.

(SOUNDBITE OF OOPHAGA LEHMANNI CALL RECORDING)

ALCORN: It sounds kind of like a duck quacking, I guess. And we do hear a faint quacking in response somewhere uphill. And we try to follow it, but the jungle is too thick to move forward. So after about 15 minutes of unrequited frog calls, we give up on this frog and go deeper into the jungle. It's just constant macheteing (ph)...

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHETE CLANGING)

ALCORN: ...Until...

LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: ...Just above a stream...

(Speaking Spanish)?

LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: Aye, there it is.

LOPEZ: (Speaking Spanish).

GONZALEZ: The frog is just sitting on a branch. Lucely's like, hi, my lehmanni. How pretty, my precious baby. I love you.

ALCORN: It's, like, the size of a plum. And its red and black stripes look wet and bright. And the tips of its toes are white, like it just had its nails done. And even though Lucely is right up next to it, it doesn't try to escape. It just sits there.

GONZALEZ: These frogs don't worry about predators. Their bright colors tell predators to stay away - that they're poisonous.

ALCORN: Yeah. The colors and friendly disposition that have made them so attractive to pet owners - those are part of an evolutionary strategy that's helped them thrive here in their natural environment for millions of years.

(SOUNDBITE OF OOPHAGA LEHMANNI FROG CALLING)

GONZALEZ: This valley used to be filled with the sound of Oophaga lehmanni.

ALCORN: ...Up until 50 years ago, when the worst predators arrived - the smugglers.

GONZALEZ: Carlos Rodriguez Mera remembers when the smugglers started showing up back then - when he was a kid.

CARLOS RODRIGUEZ MERA: (Speaking Spanish).

GONZALEZ: "Tall guys," he says.

Americans and Germans, offering money to catch a hundred frogs...

MERA: (Speaking Spanish).

GONZALEZ: ...A hundred and fifty frogs. And Carlos would do it 'cause he says he needed to help his family.

MERA: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: He'd spend a few days camping under a tarp in the woods, hunting the frogs during the day - the same way we did, on the steep wet slopes. But if he saw one, he'd grab it.

MERA: (Speaking Spanish).

GONZALEZ: Barehanded, quick - and dump it in a plastic bag.

MERA: (Speaking Spanish).

ALCORN: Carlos says the smugglers would offer him a few dollars per frog.

GONZALEZ: And according to the biologists who study these frogs, smugglers took an estimated 80,000 frogs out of this valley. Today, there are probably less than 5,000 of them left. And Ivan - Ivan who rescued those frogs from the airport in the '90s - he says that part of what makes this frog so special is that they are rare.

LOZANO ORTEGA: If you have any kind of good that is rare and difficult to find, difficult to purchase you will meet probably a very high price for that, like a diamond.

GONZALEZ: Like a diamond - so, like, if a non-endangered, regular, old, cute, small frog went for $30 back in the '90s, this frog was 10 times that - $300. People kind of only want it because it's hard to get. It's like a fancy bag or, like, limited edition sneakers or something. And they will pay whatever they need to get their hands on one. It is what is called a Veblen good.

ALCORN: With normal goods, like, I don't know, socks or, like, carrots, the demand goes up as the goods get cheaper. But with Veblen goods, like this frog, the high price is actually part of the appeal. So the demand goes up as they get more expensive.

LOZANO ORTEGA: The demand is not going to stop. It's going to stop when the frogs are extinct.

ALCORN: And if you can't stop the demand, Ivan starts wondering if he could do something about the supply. Like, what if you could make the diamond of the frog world common?

LOZANO ORTEGA: Exactly - because these are not diamonds in the end. They will breed.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. The frogs will breed. This is the heart of Ivan's big plan to save this tiny animal.

LOZANO ORTEGA: So our bet was breeding them in large numbers, flooding the market, decreasing the prices so nobody wants ever to go to the jungle and poach these animals for the international trade.

ALCORN: So you're going to put the smugglers out of business with economics, basically.

LOZANO ORTEGA: Exactly.

GONZALEZ: Ivan isn't talking here about breeding frogs to release in the wild to repopulate the Anchicaya Valley. He is talking about breeding frogs to sell to frog collectors overseas so that everyone can leave the few remaining Oophaga lehmanni alone. And his goal is to create a supply glut - so many frogs that the price would drop, and it just wouldn't be worth poaching or smuggling anymore. That was his idea.

ALCORN: But no one had ever done any of this before. To pull this off, he was going to have to figure out how to breed them, how to get the Colombian government to let him sell them and then sell so many that he'd drive down the price and outcompete the smugglers.

(SOUNDBITE OF GATE OPENING)

ALCORN: And this is the place where he was going to try to do all that. It's a frog breeding facility - a frog farm a couple hours outside of Bogota, guarded by a whiny dog named Molly.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOG WHINING)

LOZANO ORTEGA: Come on, Molly. Welcome. This is it. This is Tesoros.

ALCORN: Wow. It looks...

GONZALEZ: This is Tesoros de Colombia, the Treasures of Colombia. That's what he called it.

ALCORN: In 2011, Ivan got a batch of Oophaga lehmanni frogs specifically for the purpose of breeding here. Those airport frogs, they were long gone. But now he needed to keep these new frogs alive.

LOZANO ORTEGA: You know what that is?

ALCORN: There's a lot of carrots with labels on it, it looks like.

LOZANO ORTEGA: Exactly.

ALCORN: Are those for the humans or for the frogs?

LOZANO ORTEGA: No, not even close - those are for the crickets.

ALCORN: The carrots are for the crickets, and the crickets are for the frogs.

GONZALEZ: Now, in the wild, these frogs do not necessarily eat just crickets. Ivan learns that they eat, like, 80 different types of bugs. And these jungle bugs are actually what make these frogs poisonous. Frogs in captivity, because of their boring captive cricket diet, actually stop being poisonous - whoa.

ALCORN: Ivan does sprinkle the crickets with different supplements to try to simulate that jungle diet. There is no supplement for poisonousness, but there is one for color, actually. It helps give them that bright, bright shade of red they get in the wild.

GONZALEZ: Yeah, and the frogs are eating these crickets sprinkled with whatever color-enhancing thing Ivan's got. So he's keeping these frogs alive and nice and bright how everyone likes them. But these frogs, they were not really laying eggs. These frogs are not like other frogs. They don't dump a thousand eggs at once. They only lay, like, 4 or 5 eggs at a time. And they don't lay eggs in any old place, either. These frogs need to feel comfortable if they're going to make babies.

ALCORN: To breed these frogs, Ivan is learning how to think like a frog. He learns they like to lay their eggs in private, not just out there in the terrarium where everybody can see. So he gives the frogs a little pipe where they can sneak in, have some privacy.

GONZALEZ: And they start laying eggs, little eggs that will hatch into tadpoles and become real Oophaga lehmanni frogs. And the most important part of Ivan's process is actually what he feeds the tadpoles.

LOZANO ORTEGA: The tadpoles will eat only eggs for their development.

ALCORN: I'm sorry. They eat eggs?

LOZANO ORTEGA: Eggs.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. These tadpoles eat eggs, and not just any eggs - basically, their brothers and sisters. Oophaga lehmanni tadpoles eat Oophaga lehmanni eggs.

ALCORN: Is that a common thing? Is that just a normal frog behavior?

LOZANO ORTEGA: I don't know. That's what makes this species very special because they are not easy to breed in captivity.

ALCORN: Because you have to feed them...

LOZANO ORTEGA: You have to feed them eggs. You cannot feed them anything else.

GONZALEZ: Even in the wild, the mama frog feeds her tadpoles some of her other eggs. This is part of why this frog is so rare in the wild - because they eat their own. Oophaga actually means egg eater.

LOZANO ORTEGA: That's the most important part or aspect of this farm.

ALCORN: And that's the secret to...

LOZANO ORTEGA: That's the secret.

ALCORN: It takes Ivan almost two years, but he finally gets the first batch of frogs to survive - four little frog babies.

LOZANO ORTEGA: It was stressful. I mean, this was really stressful because it's like, you know, having a human baby. I have three daughters, so I know the feeling. Every day, I was worried that they will die. I was, every day when I was not at the farm, calling, saying, how are they? Are they still alive? And they said, yes. The four of them? Yes.

GONZALEZ: All four frogs made it to adulthood, and then they made babies.

ALCORN: Now he needed to try to sell them, to get legal permission to sell a critically endangered species. It's controversial. When people have tried this kind of thing in the past, it hasn't always worked out so well.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. Things kind of backfired when people started doing this with tigers, for example. People started breeding tigers in China, Laos, South Africa for the explicit purpose of killing them to sell their parts - their skin, their teeth, bones. Now, the goal was to have everyone kind of, like, leave the wild tigers alone. But breeding tigers like this kind of made the problem worse because suddenly authorities had to try to figure out which tiger teeth were farmed and legal and which were wild and illegal. And with these farmed tiger parts available, it reduced the stigma of owning tiger parts in general, actually increasing demand and endangering even more wild tigers.

ALCORN: In Ivan's case, it was up to the Colombian government to weigh these kinds of arguments and decide whether or not to give him permission. They'd never given anyone this kind of permission before to sell Colombia's endangered frogs. So a year went by, then two. And the frogs, they're just piling up in his lab. He can't sell a single one. His business partners quit. He's hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and he's losing hope.

LOZANO ORTEGA: I was angry all the time. It was terrible.

ALCORN: Did you think about shutting it down then?

LOZANO ORTEGA: How? I mean, I was in a very bad situation economically, mentally. But I had - this is my life project, you know? You don't abandon your life project.

ALCORN: Finally, after about three years, the Colombian government gives Ivan permission to sell the first-ever legal export of Oophaga lehmanni. He ships off 35 frogs in a box headed to New York City.

GONZALEZ: This is what Ivan wanted - people buying lab-made frogs instead of black-market, poached jungle frogs.

LOZANO ORTEGA: Everyone was like, you know, shouting and saying, this is incredible. We made history. This is the new hobby. This is the new way of conservation. It was crazy.

ALCORN: Were you thinking, we did it?

LOZANO ORTEGA: Yes. I thought - I said, with this, we're not going to lose this incredible species anymore. I was really confident.

ALCORN: But it is not so easy to outsmart and outcompete the smugglers.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GONZALEZ: And after the break, Ivan's plan to save the Oophaga lehmanni frog might actually endanger other animals.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

ALCORN: When Ivan sold those first 35 lab-bred Oophaga lehmanni frogs, he actually got on a plane and flew to New York City himself to hand-deliver the frogs to the frog buyers.

GONZALEZ: It's a big party. There's champagne. The frogs were there, Ivan and the frog buyers.

ALCORN: Like, Americans and Europeans purchasing frogs - this is, in a way, the source of the problem, right? These are the people who are...

LOZANO ORTEGA: I never thought that they were doing anything wrong. I mean...

ALCORN: You didn't think it was wrong, like, in those early days, when you found all the trafficked frogs, and...

LOZANO ORTEGA: No.

ALCORN: ...You find out it's because of people buying them?

LOZANO ORTEGA: It is - it was wrong for Colombia, for the species in Colombia, but from their point of view, they were not - doing nothing wrong. They were just frog lovers that wanted their frogs. If you are not working with them, this thing is not going to have success.

ALCORN: Yeah.

LOZANO ORTEGA: So they must be part of the solution.

CHRIS MILLER: So my name is Chris Miller, and I - in my fun life, I breed frogs.

GONZALEZ: Chris Miller is a frog collector in Chicago. He actually started when he was a kid, and someone randomly gave him a frog.

MILLER: They're like, would you like a frog? And so I - I'm like, yeah, of course. Like, who doesn't want a frog?

ALCORN: That one frog turned into more than a thousand frogs. He keeps them in his garage, which he calls Frogville (ph).

GONZALEZ: No, he doesn't.

ALCORN: Yes, he does.

(LAUGHTER)

ALCORN: And 20 years ago, he bought some Oophaga lehmanni.

MILLER: They weren't readily available, but if you knew who to ask, you could get them.

GONZALEZ: Chris bought three Oophaga lehmanni, smuggled out of the Anchicaya Valley in the Colombian rainforest.

ALCORN: The price for these smuggled frogs was $300 each.

GONZALEZ: Not cheap, but actually it was a lot cheaper than the frogs from Ivan's facility, from Tesoros. When Ivan first started selling frogs, they were going for $1,000 to $2,000 for a single frog.

MILLER: We in Frogville, as we call it up here - we can't be continuous customers of Tesoros because we just don't have the money to do it.

GONZALEZ: Now, Ivan, the frog breeder - he has been lowering his prices to try to compete with the black market frog rates. His most recent frog price list says one Oophaga lehmanni goes for $900. Ivan says he's even sold some for $500.

ALCORN: But from what we can tell, that's still not cheaper than the smuggled frog prices. It's hard for him to compete because Ivan - he needs to make enough money to run his whole frog farm. He has to pay employees, legal advisers, government permits.

LOZANO ORTEGA: It's quite expensive to run Tesoros. It's almost $20,000 per month.

ALCORN: And this seems like one of the huge challenges of competing with a black market and with smugglers - right? - because the smugglers don't have to pay for lawyers.

LOZANO ORTEGA: No.

ALCORN: The smugglers don't have to do paperwork.

LOZANO ORTEGA: No.

ALCORN: Would your price need to come all the way down to $200 to totally drive them out of business? Make it not make sense...

LOZANO ORTEGA: Yeah, sure. We think that that's a possibility. It's not going to be - we are not going to be able to run the facility with those prices.

GONZALEZ: So Ivan's plan to turn the diamond of the frog world into something common and cheap isn't really working.

LOZANO ORTEGA: You cannot compete with the smugglers. You need also a backup.

ALCORN: His backup plan - make people care about these frogs and where they come from.

LOZANO ORTEGA: That's how you get rid of smugglers - not just by price, but with education.

GONZALEZ: Yeah. Ivan wants to educate the froggers - basically convince them that it is not OK to buy a smuggled frog and that it is actually worth it to buy frogs that are farmed ethically, no matter how pricey they might seem.

ALCORN: Yeah, it's like fair-trade frogs. And this has kind of worked. Frog collectors like Chris - they were openly buying smuggled frogs or the offspring of smuggled frogs just a couple of decades ago, and now it's a lot more taboo. Chris says there's no way he'd do that today. But there are still people buying smuggled frogs. Just a few years ago, more turned up at the Bogota airport.

GONZALEZ: But Ivan still thinks that he can end Oophaga lehmanni frog smuggling by lowering the price of his ethical frogs even more. It's just he'd have to do something a little risky, a little mad scientisty (ph). Ivan wants to introduce the frog-buying people to new species of frogs - frogs that most people have never even heard of - and start selling those. Frogs that would feel so rare, so special that he could charge a ton for them.

ALCORN: The idea is that he'd make so much money off these fancy, new frogs that he could charge way less for the Oophaga lehmanni.

LOZANO ORTEGA: That's the model of the business. Exactly. You just keep some good income for a species for a while, and then you move to other species. Why? - because there's demand for the other species. So the idea is to increase the amount of species we are working on.

GONZALEZ: He wants to breed and sell wild birds too, like this bird called the multicolored tanager.

ALCORN: Ivan's whole model - it's kind of a never-ending cycle, right? Like, to save one animal, you need to keep introducing more and more animals to the pet trade. And as I've been reporting on this, I've got to say, I do worry a bit about what will happen to these new species. Like, could they become the new target for smugglers? But Ivan - he has no doubts. He is sure that this would only be good for them, and so he's moving forward with this plan. He's working on getting a permit to sell these birds and new frogs from the Colombian government. And he says that if he doesn't get that permit in the next few years, Tesoros may have to close. And then Ivan thinks that the smugglers will start taking Oophaga lehmanni from the rainforest more and more again until, maybe, they take the last one.

This is Planet Money from NPR.
It was around 9.30 at night on a Sunday in 1998.
Ivan Lozano Ortega is at his house in Bogota, Colombia.
And he's getting ready to go to sleep when he gets a call.
We are calling from the Bogota International Airport.
I'm with the police.
And we just found a bag full of frogs.
A bag full of frogs.
And I say, OK.
The reason they called Ivan is that Ivan
was in charge of Bogota's Wildlife Rescue Center.
It was like this exotic animal orphanage
where people would send animals that somebody,
for some reason, had taken out of the wild.
We were used to receive a monkey, a parrot,
and a turtle per day.
Yeah, they'd get turtles, monkeys.
One time they even got a bear.
And they were kind of like, OK, yeah, sure.
We can handle a bear.
You can feed a bear.
I mean, it's easy to feed a bear.
But they weren't prepared, apparently, for frogs.
And it was a lot of frogs.
The police told them there were like 400.
And I was like, what?
400?
What kind of frogs?
They said, oh, those ones that
are really, really nice and good looking,
that have very bright colors and stuff like that.
And I was like, oh my god, those are poison frogs.
What am I going to do with that?
Most of them were a type of frog called ufaga lamani.
They're bright red and black.
They kind of look like they're permanently wet and, yeah,
poisonous.
So it was like mind blowing.
We were not really expecting that.
Did you say, no, we can't do that?
Like, what did you say?
I just thought to myself.
At that time, we were young.
And these challenges were enriching.
We were like, it's going to hurt,
but we are going to do our best.
Yvonne tells the police, meet me at the rescue center.
Bring the frogs.
I'll be right there.
And the first thing Yvonne has to do
is he's got to make these frogs comfortable.
And the frogs, they're really particular.
They like it hot, and they like it wet.
So we had to flood one of the offices,
put a lot of water on the floor.
Do you flooded the office?
We had to flood it.
Close all doors, put a heater,
and raise the temperature and raise the humidity to 90%.
Sounds cozy.
The staff has to work outside under a tent.
They're using makeshift butterfly nets
to catch bugs in the park to feed the frogs.
But the frogs are really picky,
and they keep rejecting their park bugs
because they don't like park bugs.
They like rainforest bugs.
At one point, one of the frogs rakes loose,
and Yvonne picks it up with his bare hand
without thinking.
And then his finger starts to swell up from the poison.
It was strange because you never see veins on a finger.
Did you call a doctor?
No, I didn't have time for that.
I was 24-hour kind of job at that time.
And the clock was ticking.
The frogs were dying.
Yvonne says they were dying like flies.
And there are not a lot of these frogs in the wild.
They are critically endangered.
And now Yvonne was responsible
for a whole bunch of them.
It's a huge responsibility.
It's like you got a box of panda bears,
and these frogs are dying on your hands.
A few weeks later,
Yvonne gets another call from the airport.
There's another 300 frogs here.
Then another call, more frogs.
And we were like, what is going on?
Somebody is depleting the Colombian forests
of these frogs.
This is a nightmare.
This is something that is going to make the species
become extinct.
Something has to be done.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Sarah Gonzalez.
And I'm Stan Alcorn.
I've been reporting in Colombia,
where these poisonous frogs have been getting poached
and smuggled out of the country.
Today on the show,
Yvonne has a plan to outsmart the smugglers.
He wants to flood the frog market
and drive the smugglers out of business.
And to see how that plan is going,
we hiked to the one tiny spot in the world
where these special frogs live,
deep in the Colombian rainforest.

When Yvonne was a kid, he dreamed of running a zoo.
He spent hours just flipping through pages
of a wildlife encyclopedia.
He could never pick just one favorite animal.
But when he grew up
and started working in animal conservation,
he decided that his favorite animals
would be all of the endangered ones.
In the beginning, I wanted to protect all the animals,
but it was impossible.
I didn't have the money to work with something
like a big jaguar or a deer or something like that.
Not even a bird.
But after he got that bag full of smuggled frogs
from the airport, the Ufaga-Lamani frogs,
something clicked.
These cute little red and black striped frogs,
they were small, they were manageable,
they were in his country, in Colombia.
Yvonne thinks,
maybe this is a species I could save from extinction.
I wanted to do something during my lifetime,
not just starting something
that somebody else could finish.
Now, to actually save this animal,
Yvonne would have to take on the smugglers.
Yeah, people were ripping these frogs from the forest
and smuggling them out of Colombia
through the Bogota Airport
to sell them to people overseas,
to people who love these frogs so much
that they want to keep them as pets.
Like, you know how there are cat people
and snake people?
Well, there are frog people,
and they call themselves froggers.
And among the froggers,
Yvonne's frog, the Ufaga-Lamani,
has become particularly treasured.
In this box right here is quite literally gold.
How is that possible?
It's just a cardboard box.
No, no.
This is a video of a guy unboxing Ufaga-Lamani frogs.
This is $65,000 worth of frogs from Colombia.
To be clear, the frogs in the video
were not smuggled.
Generally, people who buy smuggled goods
don't brag about it on YouTube,
but that is what was happening to the Ufaga-Lamani.
And to understand how this little creature
became something that froggers
were breaking the law to own,
I wanted to travel up the smuggled frog supply chain,
up a rough dirt road along the Anchicayah River
to the only place in the world where this frog lives.
A few square miles of rainforest
in the middle of the Andes Mountains in Colombia.
It's super remote, no phone service,
just like 10 houses nearby.
And to find one of these frogs,
I need to follow a stream deep into the jungle.
So I went with an expert,
a local guide who knows this rainforest.
Her name's Lucely Lopez.
Lucely says, this is my university.
The jungle is really steep.
I can barely keep up with her.
Not ideal for hiking.
At some points, we're moving just inches at a time.
It's like trying to swim through tree branches.
We are in the middle of a plant.
We can barely move.
Lucely has to break out her machete.
But finally, two and a half hours in,
Lucely hears one of the frogs calling.
She says there's one nearby.
And to keep the frog singing,
Lucely does a kind of frog call.
We're trying to follow the frog song,
but the frog goes quiet.
So we try playing a recording of a real ufaga lemani.
It sounds kind of like a duck quacking, I guess.
And we do hear a faint quacking in response
somewhere uphill, and we try to follow it.
But the jungle is too thick to move forward.
So after about 15 minutes of unrequited frog calls,
we give up on this frog and go deeper into the jungle.
It's just constant macheting.
Until,
just above a stream.
Donde?
Aye, there it is.
The frog is just sitting on a branch.
Lucely's like, hi, my lemani,
how pretty, my precious baby, I love you.
It's like the size of a plum,
and it's red and black stripes look wet and bright.
And the tips of its toes are white,
like it just had its nails done.
And even though Lucely is right up next to it,
it doesn't try to escape, it just sits there.
These frogs don't worry about anything.
These frogs don't worry about predators.
Their bright colors tell predators to stay away
that they're poisonous.
Yeah, the colors and friendly disposition
that have made them so attractive to pet owners,
those are part of an evolutionary strategy
that's helped them thrive here in their natural environment
for millions of years.
This valley used to be filled
with the sound of ufaga lemani.
Up until 50 years ago,
when the worst predators arrived, the smugglers.
Carlos Rodriguez Mera remembers when the smugglers
started showing up back then, when he was a kid.
Tall guys, he says, Americans and Germans,
offering money to catch 100 frogs, 150 frogs,
and Carlos would do it,
because he says he needed to help his family.
He'd spend a few days camping under a tarp in the woods,
hunting the frogs during the day,
the same way we did, on the steep, wet slopes.
But if he saw one, he'd grab it.
Bare-handed, quick, and dump it in a plastic bag.
Carlos says the smugglers would offer him
a few dollars per frog.
And according to the biologists,
who study these frogs,
smugglers took an estimated 80,000 frogs out of this valley.
Today, there are probably less than 5,000 of them left.
And Ivan, who rescued those frogs
from the airport in the 90s,
he says that part of what makes this frog so special
is that they are rare.
If you have any kind of good that is rare
and difficult to find, difficult to purchase,
you will meet probably a very high price for that,
like a diamond.
Like a diamond.
So like, if a non-endangered, regular, old,
cute small frog went for $30 back in the 90s,
this frog was 10 times that, $300.
People kind of only want it because it's hard to get.
It's like a fancy bag
or like limited edition sneakers or something.
And they will pay whatever they need
to get their hands on one.
It is what is called a Veblen good.
With normal goods, like, I don't know, socks
or like carrots, the demand goes up
as the goods get cheaper.
But with Veblen goods, like this frog,
the high price is actually part of the appeal.
So the demand goes up as they get more expensive.
The demand is not going to stop.
It's going to stop when the frogs are extinct.
And if you can't stop the demand,
Ivan starts wondering if he could do something
about the supply.
Like, what if he could make
the diamond of the frog world common?
Exactly, because these are not diamonds in the end.
They will breed.
Yeah, the frogs will breed.
This is the heart of Ivan's big plan
to save this tiny animal.
So our bet was breeding them in large numbers,
flooding the market, decreasing the prices.
So nobody want ever to go to the jungle
and poach these animals for the international trade.
So you're going to put the smugglers out of business
with economics, basically.
Exactly.
Ivan isn't talking here about breeding frogs
to release in the wild,
to repopulate the Anchikaya Valley.
He is talking about breeding frogs
to sell to frog collectors overseas.
So that everyone can leave
the few remaining Ufaga lemani alone.
And his goal is to create a supply glut.
So many frogs that the price would drop
and it just wouldn't be worth
poaching or smuggling anymore.
That was his idea.
But no one had ever done any of this before.
To pull this off,
he was going to have to figure out
how to breed them,
how to get the Colombian government to let him sell them
and then sell so many
that he'd drive down the price
and out-compete the smugglers.
And this is the place
where he was going to try to do all that.
It's a frog breeding facility,
a frog farm a couple hours outside of Bogota,
guarded by a whiny dog named Molly.
Hola, Molly.
Welcome.
This is it.
This is Tesoros.
This is Tesoros de Colombia,
the treasures of Colombia.
That's what he called it.
In 2011, Ivan got a batch of Ufaga-Lamani frogs,
specifically for the purpose of breeding here.
Those airport frogs, they were long gone.
But now he needed to keep these new frogs alive.
You know what that is?
There's a lot of carrots with labels on it,
it looks like.
Exactly.
Are those for the humans or for the frogs?
No, not even close.
Those are for the crickets.
The carrots are for the crickets
and the crickets are for the frogs.
Now, in the wild,
these frogs do not necessarily eat just crickets.
Ivan learns that they eat like 80 different types of bugs
and these jungle bugs
are actually what make these frogs poisonous.
Frogs in captivity,
because of their boring captive cricket diet,
actually stop being poisonous.
Whoa.
Ivan does sprinkle the crickets with different supplements
to try to simulate that jungle diet.
There is no supplement for poisonousness.
But there is one for color, actually.
It helps give them that bright, bright shade of red
they get in the wild.
Yeah, and the frogs are eating these crickets
sprinkled with whatever color enhancing thing Ivan's got.
So he's keeping these frogs alive
and nice and bright and how everyone likes them.
But these frogs, they were not really laying eggs.
These frogs are not like other frogs.
They don't dump a thousand eggs at once.
They only lay like four or five eggs at a time.
And they don't lay eggs in any old place either.
These frogs need to feel comfortable
if they're gonna make babies.
To breed these frogs,
Ivan is learning how to think like a frog.
He learns they like to lay their eggs in private,
not just out there in the terrarium
where everybody can see.
So he gives the frogs a little pipe
where they can sneak in, have some privacy.
And they start laying eggs,
little eggs that will hatch into tadpoles
and become real Ufaga-Lemani frogs.
And the most important part of Ivan's process
is actually what he feeds, the tadpoles.
The tadpoles will eat only eggs for their development.
I'm sorry, they eat eggs?
Eggs.
Yeah, these tadpoles eat eggs and not just any eggs.
Basically, they're brothers and sisters.
Ufaga-Lemani tadpoles eat Ufaga-Lemani eggs.
Is that a common thing?
Is that just a normal frog behavior?
No, no, no.
That's what makes this species very special
because they are not easy to breed in captivity.
Because you have to feed them.
You have to feed them eggs.
You cannot feed them anything else.
Even in the wild,
the mama frog feeds her tadpoles
some of her other eggs.
This is part of why this frog is so rare in the wild
because they eat their own.
Ufaga actually means egg eater.
That's the most important part or aspect of this farm.
And that's the secret?
That's the secret.
It takes Ivan almost two years,
but he finally gets the first batch of frogs to survive.
Four little frog babies.
It was stressful.
I mean, this was really stressful
because it's like having a human baby.
I have two daughters, so I know the feeling.
Every day I was worried that they will die.
I was every day when I was not at the farm
calling saying, how are they?
Are they still alive?
And they say, yes.
The four of them, yes.
All four frogs made it to adulthood
and then they made babies.
Now he needed to try to sell them
to get legal permission
to sell a critically endangered species.
That's controversial.
People have tried this kind of thing in the past.
It hasn't always worked out so well.
Yeah, things kind of backfired
when people started doing this with tigers, for example.
People started breeding tigers in China, Laos,
South Africa, for the explicit purpose of killing them
to sell their parts, their skin, their teeth, bones.
Now the goal was to have everyone kind of like
leave the wild tigers alone,
but breeding tigers like this
kind of made the problem worse
because suddenly authorities had to try to figure out
which tiger teeth were farmed and legal
and which were wild and illegal.
And with these farmed tiger parts available,
it reduced the stigma of owning tiger parts in general,
actually increasing demand
and endangering even more wild tigers.
In Yvonne's case,
it was up to the Colombian government
to weigh these kinds of arguments
and decide whether or not to give him permission.
They'd never given anyone this kind of permission before
to sell Colombia's endangered frogs.
So a year went by, then two,
and the frogs, they're just piling up in his lab.
He can't sell a single one.
His business partners quit.
He's hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt
and he's losing hope.
I was angry all the time.
It was terrible.
Did you think about shutting it down then?
I mean, I was in a very bad situation economically,
mentally, but I had, this is my life project.
You don't abandon your life project.
Finally, after about three years,
the Colombian government gives Yvonne permission
to sell the first ever legal export of Ufaga-Lamani.
He ships off 35 frogs in a box headed to New York City.
This is what Yvonne wanted.
People buying lab-made frogs
instead of black market poached jungle frogs.
Everyone was shouting and saying,
this is incredible, we made history.
This is the new hobby.
This is the new way of conservation.
It was crazy.
Were you thinking we did it?
Yes, I thought, I said,
with this, we're not going to lose
these incredible species anymore.
I was really confident.
But it is not so easy to outsmart
and out-compete the smugglers.
And after the break, Yvonne's plan
to save the Ufaga-Lamani frog
might actually endanger other animals.
There are lines the Federal Reserve just won't cross.
But when the economy is in crisis,
those lines get blurry.
You know, I don't think we had ever seen a world
in which we thought the Fed was going to sort of jump
into the corporate bond market.
And we certainly hadn't seen a world
where they were prepared to lend to mainstream businesses.
So it really underlines that during moments of crisis,
we've seen them get pretty creative.
A deep dive on Fed power,
that's in our recent bonus episode.
It's available now for Planet Money Plus listeners,
whose support helps make this show possible.
When Yvonne sold those first 35 lab-bred Ufaga-Lamani frogs,
he actually got on a plane
and flew to New York City himself
to hand deliver the frogs to the frog buyers.
It's a big party.
There's champagne, the frogs are there, Yvonne,
and the frog buyers.
Like Americans and Europeans purchasing frogs.
This is, in a way, the source of the problem, right?
These are the people who are...
I never thought that they were doing anything wrong.
I mean...
You didn't think it was wrong,
like in those early days
when you found all the traffic frogs
and you find out it's because of people buying them?
It was wrong for Colombia, for the species in Colombia.
But from their point of view,
they were doing nothing wrong.
They were just frog lovers that wanted their frogs.
If you are not working with them,
this thing is not going to have success.
So they must be part of the solution.
So my name is Chris Miller,
and I, in my fun life, I breed frogs.
Chris Miller is a frog collector in Chicago.
He actually started when he was a kid
and someone randomly gave him a frog.
They're like, would you like a frog?
And so I'm like, yeah, of course.
Like, who doesn't want a frog?
That one frog turned into more than a thousand frogs.
He keeps them in his garage, which he calls Frogville.
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does.
And 20 years ago, he bought some ufaga lemani.
They weren't readily available,
but if you knew who to ask, you could get them.
Chris bought three ufaga lemani,
smuggled out of the Anchikaya Valley
in the Colombian rainforest.
The price for these smuggled frogs was $300 each.
Not cheap, but actually it was a lot cheaper
than the frogs from Ivan's facility, from Tesoros.
When Ivan first started selling frogs,
they were going for $1,000 to $2,000 for a single frog.
We in Frogville, as we call it up here,
we can't be continuous customers at Tesoros
because we just don't have the money to do it.
Now, Ivan, the frog breeder,
he has been lowering his prices to try to compete
with the black market frog rates.
His most recent frog price list says
one ufaga lemani goes for $900.
Ivan says he's even sold some for $500.
But from what we can tell,
that's still not cheaper than the smuggled frog prices.
It's hard for him to compete
because Ivan, he needs to make enough money
to run his whole frog farm.
He has to pay employees, legal advisors,
government permits.
It's quite expensive to run Tesoros.
He's almost $20,000 per month.
Well, and this seems like one of the huge challenges
of competing with a black market and with smugglers, right?
Because the smugglers don't have to pay for lawyers.
The smugglers don't have to do paperwork.
Would your price need to come all the way down to $200
to totally drive them out of business,
make it not make sense?
We think that that's a possibility.
It's not going to be,
we're not going to be able to run the facility
with those prices.
So Ivan's plan to turn the diamond of the frog world
into something common and cheap isn't really working.
You cannot compete with the smugglers.
You need also a backup.
His backup plan,
make people care about these frogs
and where they come from.
That's how you get rid of smugglers,
not just by price, but with education.
Yeah, Ivan wants to educate the froggers,
basically convince them that it is not okay
to buy a smuggled frog
and that it is actually worth it to buy frogs
that are farmed ethically,
no matter how pricey they might seem.
Yeah, it's like fair trade frogs.
And this has kind of worked.
Frog collectors like Chris,
they were openly buying smuggled frogs
or the offspring of smuggled frogs
just a couple of decades ago.
And now it's a lot more taboo.
Chris says there's no way he'd do that today.
But there are still people buying smuggled frogs
just a few years ago,
more turned up at the Bogota Airport.
But Ivan still thinks
that he can end Ufaga-Lamani frog smuggling
by lowering the price of his ethical frogs even more.
It's just he'd have to do something a little risky,
a little mad scientist-y.
Ivan wants to introduce the frog-buying people
to new species of frogs,
frogs that most people have never even heard of
and start selling those.
Frogs that would feel so rare, so special
that he could charge a ton for them.
The idea is that he'd make so much money
off these fancy new frogs
that he could charge way less for the Ufaga-Lamani.
That's the model of the business, exactly.
You just keep some good income for species for a while
and then you move to other species.
Why?
Because there's demand for the other species.
So the idea is to increase
the amount of species we're working on.
He wants to breed and sell wild birds too,
like this bird called the multicolored tanager.
Ivan's whole model,
it's kind of a never-ending cycle, right?
Like to save one animal,
you need to keep introducing more and more animals
to the pet trade.
And as I've been reporting on this,
I do worry a bit about what will happen
to these new species.
Could they become the new target for smugglers?
But Ivan, he has no doubts.
He is sure that this would only be good for them.
And so he's moving forward with this plan.
He's working on getting a permit
to sell these birds and new frogs
from the Colombian government.
And he says that if he doesn't get that permit
in the next few years,
De Soros may have to close.
And then Ivan thinks that the smugglers
will start taking Ufaga-Lamani from the rainforest
more and more again,
until maybe they take the last one.
