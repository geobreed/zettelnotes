Ramón Méndez Galain was Uruguay's National Director of Energy from 2008 to 2015. His plan for the energy sector led to 98% of Uruguay's grid being powered by green energy. And a good deal of that comes from wind energy — from turbines like those behind him.

Back in 2007, Uruguay had a massive problem with no obvious fix. The economy of this country of 3.5 million people was growing, but there wasn't enough energy to power all that growth. There was energy rationing, and people's power bills kept going up.

"It was difficult for us to cope," Ramón Méndez Galain remembers. "It was difficult to get electricity. For some time, we were beginning to have blackouts."

Méndez Galain had trained as a particle physicist. "When you are trained as a scientist," he says, "you are trained to see an unsolved problem, and [to try] to find an explanation and a solution. So I used, if you wish, my scientific skills I had developed in order to face this difficulty with the same strategy."

He started researching different potential paths for Uruguay's energy future and reaching out to experts he knew around the world. Ultimately, he wrote up an entire plan for how Uruguay could change its energy mix so that it relied almost entirely on renewable energy. There would be less pollution, it would be better for the climate, and, he thought, in the long run, it would be the most economical choice Uruguay could make.

And then one day, Méndez Galain received a phone call in his office.

"He said, 'Oh, hi Ramón," Méndez Galain recalls. "I've been reading what you said. I'm talking with the president, and we wanted you to implement that strategy.'"

The president of Uruguay had seen Méndez Galain's plan and was now inviting him to become Uruguay's new national director of energy. Méndez Galain accepted.

Countries all over the world have spent the last decade announcing lofty goals to reduce the emissions that cause climate change. In the United States, President Biden has set a goal to reach 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. But Uruguay has almost reached that goal already. In a typical year, 98% of Uruguay's grid is powered by green energy.

Méndez Galain's plan was built around two simple facts about his country. First, while there wasn't a domestic supply of fossil fuels like coal or oil, there was a great deal of wind. Second, that wind blew over a country that was, to a great extent, composed of uninhabited agricultural land. His vision for Uruguay's energy future was to cover that empty land with hundreds of wind turbines.

Today, wind power accounts for around 40% of Uruguay's energy production. And, according to a 2008 law, all the wind in the country officially belongs to the Uruguayan people.

To solve the question of how to pay for all those turbines, Méndez Galain came up with a variation on an approach used by some electric utilities in neighboring Brazil. Those utilities were run via public-private partnerships, in which the utilities handled energy generation, while private companies were in charge of power distribution and customer service. Méndez Galain's scheme involved reversing that relationship, so that private companies would be in charge of setting up and maintaining the wind turbines that would power Uruguay's grid, while the public utility would continue to distribute that energy to its customers

His scheme had the built-in advantage of pushing the billions of dollars in upfront cost to construct all those wind turbines onto the private companies. In exchange, the public utility would agree to buy all the energy those turbines produced at a set rate for 20 years.

"Investors need to have the security that their investment will be paid back," explains Méndez Galain, "and for that they need a certain amount of time."

In 2009, Uruguay started holding auctions in which different wind companies from around the world came to bid on how cheaply they'd sell renewable energy to the country.

In 2011, Uruguay held an auction intended to secure 150 megawatts of new wind power, which would have represented about 5% of the country's energy generating capacity. After more than 20 different companies threw in their bids, Méndez Galain and his team decided to radically accelerate their timeline for the country's energy transition.

They accepted far more bids than they had originally planned, signing contracts that increased Uruguay's capacity to generate electricity not by 5%, but by more than 40%.

Within a few years of Méndez Galain receiving that phone call inviting him to become the national director of energy, he had achieved what he had set out to do. Uruguay's energy grid was powered almost exclusively by domestically created, renewable energy, and, adjusted for inflation, consumer prices had gone down. Today, there are more than 700 wind turbines installed across Uruguay's countryside.

"It was absolutely a complete transformation," says Méndez Galain. "So many people talk about what happened as an Uruguayan energy revolution. Because really it was a revolution."

Today's show was hosted by Erika Beras and Amanda Aroncyzk. It was produced by Willa Rubin with help from Emma Peaslee. It was engineered by Maggie Luthar, fact-checked by Sierra Juarez and edited by Keith Romer. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer.

ERIKA BERAS, HOST:

This week NPR is doing something new - dedicating an entire week to stories and conversations about the search for solutions to climate change. Today we are bringing you a story about a giant environmental revolution in a tiny country.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

BERAS: Last month we traveled thousands of miles to Uruguay, this tiny country tucked in between Argentina and Brazil, to hear a pretty wild story from a man named Ramon Mendez Galain. We met him at his house in Montevideo.

(Speaking Spanish).

RAMON MENDEZ GALAIN: (Speaking Spanish).

BERAS: (Speaking Spanish).

MENDEZ GALAIN: (Speaking Spanish).

BERAS: Ramon says the story starts back in 2007.

AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:

His little country had a massive problem, one that had no obvious fix. The economy of this country of 3 1/2 million people was growing, and there wasn't enough energy to power all of that growth.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So it was difficult for us to cope. It was difficult to get electricity.

ARONCZYK: There was energy rationing.

MENDEZ GALAIN: For some time, we're beginning to have blackouts.

BERAS: People's electricity bills - they'd gone way up from just a few years earlier. Ramon - at the time, he worked as a particle physicist.

MENDEZ GALAIN: I worked for many years trying to understand what happened after the Big Bang, what was the physics of the Big Bang and how matter was organizing the universe and...

BERAS: OK.

MENDEZ GALAIN: ...This kind of things.

BERAS: When I hear the Big Bang theory, I just think of the TV show now.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Absolutely.

BERAS: Ramon is the kind of guy who, when he gets interested in something, whether it's the Big Bang or, you know, his country's energy crisis, has to look at everything from every angle and never stops looking until he figures it out.

ARONCZYK: So he starts thinking about where Uruguay gets its energy from and where it could get its energy from.

MENDEZ GALAIN: When you are trained as a scientist, you are trained to see an unsolved problem and trying to find an explanation and a solution. So I use, you know, if you wish, my scientific skills I had developed in order to face this difficulty with the same strategy.

BERAS: He starts jotting ideas down in notebooks while he's at work, at home.

MENDEZ GALAIN: I mean, just informally, not - very informally.

ARONCZYK: He starts researching different sources of energy. He reaches out to experts he knows in other countries.

BERAS: And he ends up writing this whole plan about how Uruguay should just switch to renewable energy. There would be less pollution. It would be better for the climate. And in the long run, it might even be the most economical choice Uruguay could make.

ARONCZYK: And then one day he's in his office, and his phone rings. This is what he hears.

MENDEZ GALAIN: He said, hi, Ramon. I've been reading what you said. I'm talking with the president, and we wanted you to implement that strategy.

BERAS: The president as in the president of Uruguay - he'd seen Ramon's plan, and he now wanted Ramon to become Uruguay's new national director of energy.

MENDEZ GALAIN: We want you on the team. I mean, we need to do different things because in the way we are right now, I mean, we are not getting a solution. We have a more and more deep crisis.

ARONCZYK: This whole conversation - it was under three minutes.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So it was a total surprise.

BERAS: What did you say?

MENDEZ GALAIN: I said, thank you. I don't know.

BERAS: (Laughter).

ARONCZYK: He's like, I've already got a pretty good job. Do I really want to give that up? And how badly do I want to be the person who tries to completely remake my country's entire energy system? He thinks about it for 15 days.

MENDEZ GALAIN: But at the end of the day, I said yes.

ARONCZYK: Yeah. You said yes.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Yeah. I said yes. I realized that it was absolutely impossible to predetermine what would happen at the end of this experience, but I wanted to do it. So I said yes.

BERAS: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Erika Beras.

ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Countries all over the world have spent the last decade announcing lofty goals to reduce the emissions that cause climate change. Like, you know, we want to power our country using 50% renewable energy by 2035. But Uruguay - they actually did it. In a typical year, 98% of Uruguay's grid is powered by green energy.

BERAS: Today on the show, the story of how that happened, how Uruguay went all-in on Ramon's plan to keep the lights on and managed to do it without wrecking the planet at the same time.

(SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE GEORGIA'S "FRUIT SALAD")

BERAS: Ramon lives in this nice neighborhood in Montevideo, lots of houses set back from the road behind gates. We're standing outside his house on the sidewalk.

ARONCZYK: All right, so we are off. Where are we going, Erika?

BERAS: We are going to - where are we going?

MENDEZ GALAIN: I think we're going to Caracoles...

BERAS: Sierra Caracoles, right?

MENDEZ GALAIN: Sierra Caracoles.

ARONCZYK: We're going to take a little road trip with Ramon. He's going to show us what Uruguay's energy landscape looked like when he was offered his new job back in 2007. But first...

BERAS: So you're going to sit in the front, Amanda.

ARONCZYK: Yep.

...We all have to squeeze into this teeny, tiny little car.

BERAS: What was your official title in government?

MENDEZ GALAIN: What was it that time? It was director nacional de energia.

ARONCZYK: OK. Has the director nacional de energia ever been in the back of a Suzuki Celerio for two hours?

MENDEZ GALAIN: You know me, I'm a simple guy.

BERAS: (Laughter).

ARONCZYK: Very good.

BERAS: OK.

ARONCZYK: OK.

BERAS: Ramone is going to walk us or drive us through the options that were available to him back then, the different sources of energy that he could have used to power the electric grid.

ARONCZYK: Option one - natural gas. A few years before Ramone started his new job, Uruguay and Argentina had built this fancy new pipeline. At first, the road we're taking out of the city of Montevideo actually runs sort of parallel to it, but the pipeline turned out to be a little bit of a bust. And Argentina didn't end up exporting a whole lot of natural gas to Uruguay.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So we were having strong infrastructure with no capability of using it.

BERAS: And Ramone says Uruguay could have imported liquefied natural gas from other countries, but that would have required building a whole new plant to convert that liquid natural gas.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So this is very costly infrastructure. It's about more than $1 billion.

BERAS: More than $1 billion?

They didn't have $1 billion.

ARONCZYK: The next option? Coal. Coal's cheap, right?

BERAS: Is there coal here?

MENDEZ GALAIN: Coal? No. No coal at all.

BERAS: No coal.

MENDEZ GALAIN: We don't have coal. We don't have natural gas. We don't find oil. All of this need to be imported. So the decision considering coal was not to import coal in order to power power plants.

ARONCZYK: And they didn't have coal-fired power plants. So they'd have to build them, and then they'd have to expand the port to import coal.

BERAS: Ramon, he thought about nuclear, too, and Ramon wasn't totally out on nuclear. But again, there was the cost, and most likely, the country would still have to import something - in this case, uranium.

ARONCZYK: OK, fine. Now, Uruguay did have hydropower. About a quarter of the energy the country used actually came from hydroelectric dams.

MENDEZ GALAIN: But we had already used our large rivers. I mean, all the possibilities to use water from our rivers has already been used.

ARONCZYK: And when there were droughts in Uruguay, the rivers dried up. Of course, Ramon considered solar. As we're driving, the sun is full on.

BERAS: I mean, the sun is shining. It's a beautiful day. We're here.

MENDEZ GALAIN: It's a beautiful day, yeah.

BERAS: But in 2007, solar was way more expensive than it is now.

ARONCZYK: And that is when he came to a solution, a solution represented by the final stop on our little road trip.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Yeah, this is the entrance.

BERAS: Oh, this is the entrance. Oh, this is a dirt road.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Yeah, yeah.

ARONCZYK: When we get out of the car, the answer to Ramon's problem is whipping and whirling and whooshing around us.

It's windy.

MENDEZ GALAIN: You will see it's windy.

BERAS: Is it windy?

ARONCZYK: Yes.

BERAS: Ooh, it is windy.

ARONCZYK: We're at the top of one of Uruguay's highest hills. It's one of the windiest places in the country, and you can see all the way out to the Atlantic Ocean.

BERAS: And it's not just that Uruguay is windy. It's that there is so much wide-open land in the country. The overwhelming majority of the country is agricultural land, barely inhabited. People here love to share this stat - that there are four cows per person here. That means there's a lot of poop.

ARONCZYK: These are everywhere.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Everywhere.

ARONCZYK: Literally everywhere (laughter).

MENDEZ GALAIN: Remember, four cows per inhabitant.

ARONCZYK: Yes, I know - so four cow poos per inhabitant.

Yeah, I did the math. So Ramone thought about all of this windy, uninhabited land. And his vision for solving Uruguay's energy conundrum was to cover this land with rows and rows and rows of turbines. He imagined them on the hills, on the cow pastures, east, west, north, everywhere - wind turbines for everybody.

MENDEZ GALAIN: You will see that almost every place in the country is a windy place.

BERAS: They would have to bring the turbines themselves into the country, but once they were put up, that would be it. From that moment on, everything would come from Uruguay's own resources, from the wind. There'd be nothing left to import. This was the vision Ramon had brought us all this way to see.

ARONCZYK: After an hour or so, we are ready to head back to the city.

BERAS: You know?

MENDEZ GALAIN: Want me to take this?

BERAS: No, no, no, no. I'm just holding it out here.

ARONCZYK: (Inaudible) though.

BERAS: Thank you very much. I think we are good to get going on the road.

ARONCZYK: We're good. Yeah.

BERAS: So great - 2007 Ramone had settled on what he thought was the best kind of energy for Uruguay. But back at his house the next day, he tells us that making his vision a reality, that would be way more difficult.

ARONCZYK: Because remember - Ramon, he was a particle physicist. Building a nationwide network of wind turbines - that was all new territory for him and for all the people working with him in that new government job.

MENDEZ GALAIN: We didn't have the capacities in order to do that. We didn't have the experience. We didn't know how to do it.

BERAS: But Ramon knew there were all these companies around the world who did know how to do it. All he had to do was figure out a way to get them to share that expertise with Uruguay.

ARONCZYK: Ramon starts thinking about how they dealt with electricity across the border in Brazil. Some electric companies there were partly run by the government and partly run by private companies. Ramon's like, maybe something like that could work in Uruguay but with wind companies.

BERAS: Which would be great, but it wouldn't solve the much larger problem - money.

MENDEZ GALAIN: The size of our economy was about $50 billion, and we needed more than six.

BERAS: Six billion dollars - Ramon's budget to run his entire office was just $10 million.

ARONCZYK: And Uruguay's finance minister was very clear with Ramon - we are not going to fund this project. We can't just add $6 billion to our national debt. We would never be able to get decent terms on a loan ever again.

BERAS: And this is the moment when Ramon came up with his big innovation. What if they took the public/private partnership model Brazil used and put a Uruguayan twist on it?

ARONCZYK: This is how he thought it could work. Uruguay would invite companies from around the world, companies with expertise in wind energy, to cover his country with turbines.

MENDEZ GALAIN: They do their business. They know how to do it.

BERAS: Whatever energy they produced, the Uruguay public utility would agree to buy from them.

MENDEZ GALAIN: They sell everything that they are producing to the public utility.

ARONCZYK: The vast majority of the billions of dollars it would cost to put up all of these turbines, that would be paid by the companies not by the Uruguayan government.

BERAS: And to get the companies to want to take on that huge upfront cost, the government would agree to buy all of the energy a company produced at a fixed rate. So even if the market for energy fell apart, the companies would be guaranteed that the price they got would stay the same for the full length of their contract.

MENDEZ GALAIN: I mean, investor need to have this security that they will - their investment will be paid back. And for that, they need a certain amount of time.

ARONCZYK: Ramon and his team settled on contracts that would last for 20 years.

BERAS: Over the next several months, Ramon set out to convince lawmakers that his plan would work, and he got so much buy-in that they even ended up changing laws for him, like one about who owned the wind.

MENDEZ GALAIN: I mean, the wind, it does not belong to the landowner. The wind is a public good.

ARONCZYK: Yes. According to a new law, all the wind in the country now officially belonged to the Uruguayan people.

BERAS: Which was helpful because a lot of the wind Ramon wanted to use to power the grid was blowing over privately owned land. Now the wind companies would have a legal right to capture the wind.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So if you have a property with enough wind, you cannot say, I don't want a wind farm to be installed in my land.

ARONCZYK: If your property was selected to get turbined, yeah, you'd get some money. But the wind turbine would go up whether you wanted it there or not.

BERAS: In 2009, Uruguay started holding auctions where different wind companies from around the world came to bid on how cheaply they'd sell renewable energy to the country.

ARONCZYK: In 2011, they had an auction where they wanted 150 megawatts of new wind power, which would have represented about 5% of the country's energy generation. More than 20 different companies threw in their bids.

MENDEZ GALAIN: And after many ups and down, we made the almost last bidding process. And there, we got eight times what we needed.

BERAS: And even better, the bids were coming in lower than they had before. The original plan had been to keep doing these auctions for four more years, but Ramon and his team decided, let's do it all right now. Let's take all the bids.

MENDEZ GALAIN: So we are going to give contracts to those that have won. But then to those that we - apparently we didn't need them, we tell them, if you accept the price of the winner, you will also receive a long-term contract.

BERAS: Oh, OK.

MENDEZ GALAIN: And almost all of them, more than 80%, accepted the price of the winner. Their - and so they also got a contract.

ARONCZYK: This auction that was supposed to add about 5% to Uruguay's capacity to generate electricity ended up adding more than 40%. Ramon was like, these prices, they're pretty good. We may not see them again.

MENDEZ GALAIN: We realize that that was the moment that - I mean, everything that we have been working for for three years ended up with exactly what we wanted. So it was the occasion. We jumped on it.

(SOUNDBITE OF LUCAS CANTOR AND MB GORDY'S "CAVIAR")

BERAS: After the break - how did Ramon's plan work out? And is it the sort of plan that other countries should be trying to emulate?

(SOUNDBITE OF LUCAS CANTOR AND MB GORDY'S "CAVIAR")

BERAS: Within a few years of Ramon getting that life-changing phone call inviting him to become the national director of energy, he'd done the thing he had set out to do. Uruguay generated its own renewable energy and, adjusted for inflation, consumer prices had gone down. Today there are more than 700 wind turbines whooshing away.

ARONCZYK: In fact, the country is now making so much energy it's actually exporting to its neighbors, and the rate it's paying for energy has fallen by over 40%.

BERAS: Best of all, at least from a climate perspective, in a typical year, 98% of the energy used to run Uruguay's power grid comes from renewable sources - hydropower, biomass, solar and a whole bunch of wind. Today Uruguay's energy grid contributes almost nothing to greenhouse gas emissions.

MENDEZ GALAIN: It was an absolute and complete transformation, a complete transformation. Many people say that - they talk about what happened as Uruguayan revolution - energy revolution because it really was as a revolution.

BERAS: And Ramon got all this attention. He's been invited to speak in all these different countries. One year, he was in Fortune magazine's World's 50 Greatest Leader list, alongside Tim Cook, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the pope.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Yes, in some cases, I feel like a rock star because - yes, it is incredible because people want to talk with me, take a picture with me. And, you know, it's incredible.

BERAS: Now, in a lot of cases, public/private partnerships get mixed reviews. In other countries, there have been problems with quality, with accountability, with corruption.

ARONCZYK: But Ramon's model for getting private companies to set up renewable energy infrastructure for long-term contracts - still going strong. It's been used all over the world in the Dominican Republic, South Africa, Thailand. It's become kind of a new Uruguayan export.

BERAS: Still, what Ramon did - it does have some critics.

ARONCZYK: Relying so much on wind energy means there is not always enough energy when people want it. Sometimes the wind just doesn't blow enough, and it's hard and expensive to store energy for when you need it.

BERAS: So like in other parts of the world, if you live in Uruguay and you want to get the best rates on your energy, you have to sign up for this metering program where, for the busiest hours every day, any energy you use in your home will cost more. People plan their whole days around this. Like, they don't cook dinner between, say, 5 and 9 p.m. so they can save money.

ARONCZYK: And the price saving for consumers - it wasn't amazing. Just about everyone we talked to in Uruguay says, yeah, their energy bills came down a little bit, but they're still higher than what people pay across the border in Argentina and Brazil.

BERAS: Some people, they tie this directly back to Ramon's decision to accept all of the bids all at the same price, all at once - to sign up to buy way, way, way more energy than they had originally planned to because since Ramon pulled that wild card move, the price for wind energy has kept going down. It's like 30- to 40% cheaper per megawatt now than it was then. But that lower price does not matter because the utility companies signed contracts that locked in those higher rates for 20 years.

ARONCZYK: Ramon has heard this critique a lot, but at the same time, the country was paying nearly $600 million a year for energy. And he says it still didn't have enough.

MENDEZ GALAIN: Either we did what we did or we waited for 10 extra years to have electricity at the present cost. And if you compare the two options, the one that we did was the best one.

BERAS: Like what people are paying for energy at home, he says that actually has nothing to do with what he did. Because of Ramon's plan, the government is now paying around 40% less per year for energy than when he started. But he says most of those savings aren't passed on to customers.

MENDEZ GALAIN: This was perhaps the worst day when I was in office, when I realized that all this tremendous efficiency that we were getting in the electricity production will not go entirely to the electricity sector.

ARONCZYK: Instead, the government decided to use that savings to fund all of their other priorities.

MENDEZ GALAIN: I mean, it's OK, I mean, because with this money, with this tremendous cost reduction, we are financing now education and health care. So it's fine, but it's not what I was expecting.

BERAS: But there's no denying the impact of what Ramon did. When you're driving through the Uruguayan countryside, you see rows and rows of turbines stretching out into the sky, harnessing the power of the wind. What you don't see? Tankers of gas, train loads of coal, power plants spewing black smoke into the air.

ARONCZYK: In terms of limiting climate pollution and keeping the Earth's temperature from rising even more, what Uruguay has achieved doesn't amount to all that much. It's a small country. Only 3 1/2 million people live there. It was never a giant polluter.

BERAS: But Ramon says that Uruguay is important as a model to show that with a bold enough plan, any country can remake its relationship to the planet.

MENDEZ GALAIN: There's no chance of continue doing the same in this 21st century. So when there is a success case, these success stories show that the new - call it green economy, call it whatever you want to call it, but this new economy is possible. It's not just a dream.

BERAS: It's not just a dream. Uruguay - it's the proof.

ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE GEORGIA'S "STAR ALIGNMENT")

BERAS: I have actually never been very close to a windmill at all. So do they make a lot of noise?

MENDEZ GALAIN: Yes. Yes.

BERAS: What does it sound like?

MENDEZ GALAIN: Oh, it's like when you (imitating wind turbine). It's like the - it's the effect of the blades interacting with wind. I mean - and so it's kind of - you will see it.

**faster whisper:**
This week, NPR is doing something new,
dedicating an entire week to stories and conversations
about the search for solutions to climate change.
Today, we are bringing you a story
about a giant environmental revolution in a tiny country.
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Last month, we traveled thousands of miles to Uruguay,
this tiny country tucked in between Argentina and Brazil.
To hear a pretty wild story
from a man named Ramon Mendez-Galain.
We met him at his house in Montevideo.
Hola!
Hola Ramon, mucho gusto!
Hola mucho gusto!
Erika!
Erika, bienvenida!
Ramon says the story starts back in 2007.
His little country had a massive problem,
one that had no obvious fix.
The economy of this country
of three and a half million people was growing
and there wasn't enough energy
to power all of that growth.
So it was difficult for us to cope.
It was difficult to get electricity.
There was energy rationing.
For some time, we're beginning to have blackouts.
People's electricity bills?
They'd gone way up from just a few years earlier.
Ramon, at the time, he worked as a particle physicist.
I worked for many years trying to understand
what happened after the Big Bang,
what was the physics after the Big Bang,
and how matter was organized in the universe
and these kind of things.
When I hear the Big Bang theory,
I just think of the TV show now.
Absolutely!
Ramon is the kind of guy
who, when he gets interested in something,
whether it's the Big Bang
or his country's energy crisis,
has to look at everything from every angle
and never stops looking until he figures it out.
So he starts thinking about
where Uruguay gets its energy from
and where it could get its energy from.
When you are trained as a scientist,
you are trained to see an unsolved problem
and trying to find an explanation and a solution.
So I use, if you wish, my scientific skills
I had developed in order to face this difficulty
with the same strategy.
He starts jotting ideas down in notebooks
while he's at work, at home.
I mean, just informally, very informally.
He starts researching different sources of energy.
He reaches out to experts he knows in other countries.
And he ends up writing this whole plan
about how Uruguay should just switch to renewable energy.
There would be less pollution.
It would be better for the climate.
And in the long run,
it might even be the most economical choice
Uruguay could make.
And then one day, he's in his office
and his phone rings.
This is what he hears.
He said, oh, hi, Ramon.
I've been reading what you said
and talking with the president
and we wanted you to implement that strategy.
The president, as in the president of Uruguay.
He'd seen Ramon's plan
and he now wanted Ramon to become
Uruguay's new national director of energy.
We want you on the team.
I mean, we need to do different things
because in the way we are right now,
I mean, we are not getting a solution.
We have a more and more deep crisis.
This whole conversation, it was under three minutes.
So it was a total surprise.
And what did you say?
I said, thank you.
I don't know.
He's like, I've already got a pretty good job.
Do I really want to give that up?
And how badly do I want to be the person
who tries to completely remake
my country's entire energy system?
He thinks about it for 15 days.
But at the end of the day, I say yes.
Yeah, he said yes.
Yeah, I say yes.
I realized that it was absolutely impossible
to predetermine what would happen
at the end of this experience,
but I wanted to do it.
So I said yes.
Hello, and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Erika Barris.
And I'm Amanda Aronchik.
Countries all over the world have spent the last decade
announcing lofty goals to reduce the emissions
that cause climate change.
Like, you know, we want to power our country
using 50% renewable energy by 2035.
But Uruguay, they actually did it.
In a typical year, 98% of Uruguay's grid
is powered by green energy.
Today on the show, the story of how that happened,
how Uruguay went all in on Ramon's plan
to keep the lights on and managed to do it
without wrecking the planet at the same time.

Ramon lives in this nice neighborhood in Montevideo,
lots of houses set back from the road behind gates.
We're standing outside his house on the sidewalk.
All right, so we are off.
Where are we going, Erika?
We are going to, where are we going?
I think we're going to Caracoles.
Sierra Caracoles, right?
Sierra de los Caracoles.
We are going to take a little road trip with Ramon.
He's going to show us what Uruguay's energy landscape
looked like when he was offered his new job back in 2007.
But first,
So you're going to sit in the front, Amanda.
Yep.
We all have to squeeze into this teeny tiny little car.
What was your official title in government?
What was at that time,
it was Director Nacional de Energía.
Has the Director Nacional de Energía
ever been in the back of a Suzuki Celerio
for two hours?
You know Naomi, I'm a simple guy.
Very good.
Okay.
Okay.
Ramon is going to walk us, or drive us,
through the options that were available to him back then,
the different sources of energy that he could have used
to power the electric grid.
Option one, natural gas.
A few years before Ramon started his new job,
Uruguay and Argentina had built this fancy new pipeline.
At first, the road we're taking out of the city
of Montevideo actually runs sort of parallel to it,
but the pipeline turned out to be a little bit of a bust
and Argentina didn't end up exporting
a whole lot of natural gas to Uruguay.
So we were having strong infrastructure
with no capability of using it.
And Ramon says Uruguay could have imported
liquefied natural gas from other countries,
but that would have required building a whole new plant
to convert that liquid natural gas.
So this is very costly infrastructure.
It's about more than a billion dollars.
More than a billion dollars?
They didn't have a billion dollars.
The next option, coal.
Coal's cheap, right?
Is there coal here?
Coal, no, no coal at all.
No coal at all.
We don't have coal.
We don't have natural gas.
We don't have oil.
All of this needs to be imported.
So the decision concerning coal was not to import coal
in order to power our plants.
And they didn't have coal-fired power plants.
So they'd have to build them,
and then they'd have to expand the port to import coal.
Ramon, he thought about nuclear too.
And Ramon wasn't totally out on nuclear,
but again, there was the cost.
And most likely,
the country would still have to import something.
In this case, uranium.
Okay, fine.
Now, Uruguay did have hydropower.
About a quarter of the energy the country used
actually came from hydroelectric dams.
But we had already used our large rivers.
I mean, all the possibilities to use water
from our rivers has already been used.
And when there were droughts in Uruguay,
the rivers dried up.
Of course, Ramon considered solar.
As we're driving, the sun is full on.
I mean, the sun is shining.
It's a beautiful day.
We're here.
It's a beautiful day, yeah.
But in 2007,
solar was way more expensive than it is now.
And that is when he came to a solution.
A solution represented by the final stop
on our little road trip.
Yeah, this is the entrance.
Oh, this is the entrance.
Oh, this is a dirt road.
When we get out of the car,
the answer to Ramon's problem is whipping
and whirling and whooshing around us.
It's windy.
You will say it's windy.
Is it windy?
Yes.
Oh, it is windy.
We're at the top of one of Uruguay's highest hills.
It's one of the windiest places in the country
and you can see all the way out to the Atlantic Ocean.
And it's not just that Uruguay is windy.
It's that there is so much wide open land in the country.
The overwhelming majority of the country
is agricultural land, barely inhabited.
People here love to share this stat
that there are four cows per person here.
That means there's a lot of poop.
These are everywhere, literally everywhere.
Remember, four cows per inhabitant.
Yes, I know.
So four cow poos per inhabitant.
Yeah, I did the math.
So Ramon thought about all of this windy,
uninhabited land and his vision
for solving Uruguay's energy conundrum
was to cover this land with rows
and rows and rows of turbines.
He imagined them on the hills, on the cow pastures,
east, west, north, everywhere.
Wind turbines for everybody.
You will see that almost every place
in the country is a windy place.
They would have to bring the turbines themselves
into the country, but once they were put up,
that would be it.
From that moment on, everything would come
from Uruguay's own resources, from the wind.
There'd be nothing left to import.
This was the vision Ramon had brought us
all this way to see.
After an hour or so,
we are ready to head back to the city.
You know?
No, no, no, no, I'm just holding it out here.
Thank you very much.
I think we are good to get going on the road.
So great.
2007 Ramon had settled on what he thought
was the best kind of energy for Uruguay.
But back at his house the next day,
he tells us that making his vision a reality,
that would be way more difficult.
Because remember Ramon, he was a particle physicist,
building a nationwide network of wind turbines
that was all new territory for him
and for all the people working with him
in that new government job.
We didn't have the capacities
to do that, we didn't have the experience,
we didn't know how to do it.
But Ramon knew there were all these companies
around the world who didn't know how to do it.
All he had to do was figure out a way
to get them to share that expertise with the Uruguay.
Ramon starts thinking about how they dealt
with electricity across the border in Brazil.
Some electric companies there were partly run
by the government and partly run by private companies.
Ramon's like, maybe something like that could work
in Uruguay, but with wind companies?
Which would be great,
but it wouldn't solve the much larger problem, money.
The size of our economy was about $50 billion.
I would need more than six.
Six billion dollars.
Ramon's budget to run his entire office
was just $10 million.
And Uruguay's finance minister was very clear
with Ramon, we are not going to fund this project.
We can't just add $6 billion to our national debt.
We would never be able to get decent terms
on a loan ever again.
And this is the moment when Ramon came up
with his big innovation.
What if they took the public-private partnership model
Brazil used and put a Uruguayan twist on it?
This is how we thought it could work.
Uruguay would invite companies from around the world,
companies with expertise in wind energy,
to cover his country with turbines.
They do their business, they know how to do it.
Whatever energy they produced,
the Uruguay public utility would agree to buy from them.
They sell everything that they are producing
to the public utility.
The vast majority of the billions of dollars
it would cost to put up all of these turbines,
that would be paid by the companies,
not by the Uruguayan government.
And to get the companies to want to take on
that huge upfront cost,
the government would agree to buy all of the energy
a company produced at a fixed rate.
So even if the market for energy fell apart,
the companies would be guaranteed
that the price they got would stay the same
for the full length of their contract.
I mean, investors need to have the security
that their investment will be paid back.
And for that, they need a certain amount of time.
Ramon and his team settled on contracts
that would last for 20 years.
Over the next several months,
Ramon set out to convince lawmakers
that his plan would work.
And he got so much buy-in
that they even ended up changing laws for him.
Like one about who owned the wind.
I mean, the wind, it does not belong to the land owner.
The wind is a public good.
Yes, according to a new law,
all the wind in the country
now officially belonged to the Uruguayan people.
Which was helpful,
because a lot of the wind Ramon wanted to use
to power the grid was blowing over privately owned land.
Now the wind companies would have a legal right
to capture the wind.
So if you have a property with enough wind,
you cannot say,
I don't want a wind farm to be installing my land.
If your property was selected to get turbine,
yeah, you'd get some money.
But the wind turbine would go up
whether you wanted it there or not.
In 2009, Uruguay started holding auctions
where different wind companies from around the world
came to bid on how cheaply they'd sell
renewable energy to the country.
In 2011, they had an auction where they wanted
150 megawatts of new wind power,
which would have represented about 5%
of the country's energy generation.
More than 20 different companies threw in their bids.
And after many ups and downs,
we made the almost last bidding process.
And there we got eight times what we needed.
And even better,
the bids were coming in lower than they had before.
The original plan had been to keep doing these auctions
for four more years.
But Ramon and his team decided,
let's do it all right now.
Let's take all the bids.
So we are going to give contracts to those that have won.
But then to those that we apparently we didn't need them,
we tell them if you accept the price of the winner,
you will also receive a long-term contract.
And almost all of them,
more than 80% accepted the price of the winner.
And so they also got a contract.
This auction that was supposed to add about 5%
to Uruguay's capacity to generate electricity
ended up adding more than 40%.
Ramon was like, these prices, they're pretty good.
We may not see them again.
We realized that that was the moment,
that everything that we had been working for
for three years ended up with exactly what we wanted.
So it was the occasion.
We jumped on it.
After the break,
how did Ramon's plan work out?
And is it the sort of plan that other countries
should be trying to emulate?

Within a few years of Ramon getting
that life-changing phone call,
inviting him to become the National Director of Energy,
he'd done the thing he had set out to do.
Uruguay generated its own renewable energy
and adjusted for inflation,
consumer prices had gone down.
Today, there are more than 700 wind turbines
whooshing away.
In fact, the country is now making so much energy,
it's actually exporting to its neighbors.
And the rate it's paying for energy
has fallen by over 40%.
Best of all, at least from a climate perspective,
in a typical year, 98% of the energy used to run
Uruguay's power grid comes from renewable sources,
hydropower, biomass, solar, and a whole bunch of wind.
Today, Uruguay's energy grid contributes almost nothing
to greenhouse gas emissions.
There was a absolutely and complete transformation,
a complete transformation.
Many people say that they talk about what happened
as the Uruguayan Revolution, energy revolution,
because it really was as a revolution.
And Ramon got all this attention.
He's been invited to speak
in all these different countries.
One year, he was in Fortune Magazine's
World's 50 Greatest Leader list,
alongside Tim Cook, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the Pope.
Yes, in some cases, I feel like a rock star,
because yes, it's incredible,
because people want to talk with me,
take a picture with me, and it's incredible.
Now, in a lot of cases,
public-private partnerships get mixed reviews.
In other countries, there have been problems
with quality, with accountability, with corruption.
But Ramon's model for getting private companies
to set up renewable energy infrastructure
for long-term contracts is still going strong.
It's been used all over the world,
the Dominican Republic, South Africa, Thailand.
It's become kind of a new Uruguayan export.
Still, what Ramon did, it does have some critics.
Relying so much on wind energy means
there is not always enough energy when people want it.
Sometimes, the wind just doesn't blow enough,
and it's hard and expensive to store energy
for when you need it.
So, like in other parts of the world,
if you live in Uruguay
and you want to get the best rates on your energy,
you have to sign up for this metering program,
where for the busiest hours every day,
any energy you use in your home will cost more.
People plan their whole days around this,
like they don't cook dinner between, say, 5 and 9 p.m.,
so they can save money.
And the price saving for consumers, it wasn't amazing.
Just about everyone we talk to in Uruguay says,
yeah, their energy bills came down a little bit,
but they're still higher than what people pay
across the border in Argentina and Brazil.
Some people, they tie this directly back
to Ramon's decision to accept all of the bids,
all at the same price, all at once,
to sign up to buy way, way, way more energy
than they had originally planned to.
Because since Ramon pulled that wild card move,
the price for wind energy has kept going down.
It's like 30 to 40% cheaper per megawatt now
than it was then.
But that lower price does not matter
because the utility companies signed contracts
that locked in those higher rates for 20 years.
Ramon has heard this critique a lot,
but at the same time,
the country was paying nearly $600 million a year
for energy, and he says it still didn't have enough.
Either we did what we did,
or we waited for 10 extra years
to have electricity at the present cost.
And if you compare the two options,
the one that we did was the best one.
Like what people are paying for energy at home.
He says that actually has nothing to do with what he did.
Because of Ramon's plan,
the government is now paying around 40% less per year
for energy than when he started.
But he says most of those savings
aren't passed on to customers.
This was perhaps the worst day when I was in office,
when I realized that all these tremendous efficiencies
that we were getting in the electricity production
would not go entirely to the electricity sector.
Instead, the government decided to use that savings
to fund all of their other priorities.
I mean, it's okay, I mean,
because with this money,
with this tremendous cost reduction,
we are financing now education and health care,
so it's fine, but it's not what I was expecting.
But there's no denying the impact of what Ramon did.
When you're driving through the Uruguayan countryside,
you see rows and rows of turbines
stretching out into the sky,
harnessing the power of the wind.
What you don't see?
Tankers of gas, train loads of coal,
power plants spewing black smoke into the air.
In terms of limiting climate pollution
and keeping the Earth's temperature
from rising even more,
what Uruguay has achieved
doesn't amount to all that much.
It's a small country,
only three and a half million people live there.
It was never a giant polluter.
But Ramon says that Uruguay is important as a model
to show that with a bold enough plan,
any country can remake its relationship to the planet.
There's no chance of continue doing the same
in this 21st century.
So when there is a success case,
these success stories show that the new,
call it green economy,
call it whatever you want to call it,
but this new economy is possible.
It's not just a dream.
It's not just a dream.
Uruguay, it's the proof.
