Several United Airlines flight attendants wearing "CHAOS" T-shirts at a meeting to decide plans for a potential strike in 2001. CHAOS—an acronym for "Create Havoc Around Our System"—is a strike strategy first used in 1993 during a labor dispute between Alaska Airlines and their flight attendants' union. The strategy can keep a company guessing about when, where or even how a strike might happen.

When contract negotiations between Alaska Airlines and their flight attendants' union broke down in 1993, the union had a choice to make.

The union — The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA — knew that if they chose to strike, Alaska Airlines could use a plan. While Alaska Airlines technically couldn't fire someone on strike, they could permanently replace the striking flight attendants with new workers. Essentially, if the union went on strike, they could risk thousands of people's jobs. The flight attendants knew they needed a counter-strategy.

They went with a strategy they called CHAOS: "Create Havoc Around Our System."

The strategy had two phases. Phase one: The union kept Alaska guessing about when, where, and how a strike might happen. They kept everyone, even their own members, in the dark. And in turn, Alaska Airlines had to be prepared for a strike at any place and any time. Phase two was to go on strike in a targeted and strategic way.

The havoc that the flight attendants created set off a sort-of labor-dispute arms race and would go on to inspire strikes today. And, it showed how powerful it can be to introduce a little chaos into negotiations.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

I am mildly obsessed with these moments in history - specifically, sports history - when somebody looks at the way everybody is doing something and says, but, wait a second. What if I tried it this totally unexpected other way?

You know, famously, in high jump, a guy named Dick Fosbury started jumping over the bar backwards, and it was so effective that now everyone does it.

Or in baseball - at some point, a very clever player was like, what if instead of swinging at a fast-moving ball - what if I just hold the bat up to where the ball is going to be and (clicks tongue) knock it frustratingly into the infield? And the bunt is born. Love the bunt.

And look, I'm obsessed with these moments because it forces everyone to be like, wait a second. Can they do that? That can't be legal. But yeah, it is, and the game is changed forever.

NICK FOUNTAIN, HOST:

And Kenny, of course, these moments don't just happen in sporting competition. They happen in our world, too - the world of economics and business. And there is an example that has become particularly relevant right now.

MALONE: Yeah, so we're in the middle of what people have been calling hot labor summer. I guess it's turned into, I don't know, unseasonably warm labor fall or whatever.

FOUNTAIN: (Laughter).

MALONE: But yes, we are seeing this spate of labor actions across the country - strikes in Hollywood, at hospitals and schools, at car factories.

FOUNTAIN: And, you know, strikes are not so different from sports. They both have chanting and people holding up punny signs. But more importantly, they also have competing teams employing tactics and countertactics and counter-countertactics.

MALONE: In other words, labor is kind of exactly the right kind of situation for the right person to come along and jump backwards over the way things are supposed to work and change labor disputes forever.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANTOINE BRUNO FREDERIQUE BLANC, JAMES PATRICK KALETH AND MAX BRONCO'S "TAKE ME BACK AGAIN")

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

FOUNTAIN: And I'm Nick Fountain. And if you had to pick a Fosbury flop, bunt moment in labor history, a decent candidate might be what happened 30 years ago when one airline went to war with a group of scrappy flight attendants.

MALONE: Today on the show, the story of what happened when a union figured out how to strike without really going on strike. It seemed too good to be true. There were legal challenges. There were shady flights to Guadalajara. And arguably, it's a case study that is still shaping the labor disputes we see today.

(SOUNDBITE OF ANTOINE BRUNO FREDERIQUE BLANC, JAMES PATRICK KALETH AND MAX BRONCO'S "TAKE ME BACK AGAIN")

MALONE: Before we get into our story, you have to understand this enormous threat that has been hanging over airline unions for the last 3 1/2 decades.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah, we're going to call it the TWA threat because, in 1986, the flight attendants for Trans World Airlines, also known as TWA, were in a labor dispute with their airline. And it was looking like they were going to have to strike.

MALONE: And, you know, the thing about a strike is if you generally follow all the rules and the letter of the law, the government protects that labor action. Like, you are not allowed to be fired when you're striking. That's the deal. So great - the TWA flight attendants went on strike.

FOUNTAIN: But what was so notable about what happened in 1986 is that TWA found a legal workaround - a way to effectively fire all those striking flight attendants without technically firing anyone.

MALONE: Yeah, apparently, when a flight attendant walked off the job - went on strike - it was legal for TWA to fill that newly vacated position. TWA wasn't actually firing anyone, but the flight attendant that went on strike - well, they would have to wait until another position opened up. And, of course, until that happened, that flight attendant was functionally fired. They weren't working. They weren't earning a paycheck.

FOUNTAIN: And the TWA move in 1986 was to do this on a massive scale. When the flight attendants went on strike, the company started replacing them - thousands of people. It would take years before a new TWA job would open up for most of them.

DAVID BORER: And they were all replaced by scabs. The sanitized term for it is permanent replacements.

MALONE: But you're a labor lawyer, so...

BORER: Right.

MALONE: ...You call them scabs, sure.

BORER: That's right.

MALONE: This is longtime labor lawyer David Borer.

BORER: It was horrifying. And, you know, you look at that and you think, oh, my gosh, we can't ever let this happen again.

MALONE: David was watching this TWA fiasco carefully because back then, he was just starting out as the union lawyer for a different group of flight attendants, which included the ones that our story is about today, the flight attendants of Alaska Airlines.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR: At Alaska Airlines, we discount fares, but we never discount service.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FOUNTAIN: Ba, ba, ba, ba-bum. Ba-bum, ba-bum.

So we pick up a handful of years after the TWA stuff. It's 1993. David was negotiating the new contract for those Alaska Airlines flight attendants.

MALONE: And David says, negotiations were not going very well. And so he and the flight attendants, they had started meeting to discuss what to do next.

BORER: We spent the better part of a week talking about strategy. And we knew the guiding thing behind all of it was, we can't do what the TWA flight attendants did.

MALONE: Right, because now all of the airlines have the TWA playbook. So if your flight attendants go on strike, you just use the old TWA move and replace those pesky strikers.

FOUNTAIN: One of the people David was strategizing with...

GAIL BIGELOW: Good morning, Nick. It's Gail Bigelow.

FOUNTAIN: Gail Bigelow was an Alaska Airlines flight attendant and one of the union's lead negotiators. And she says, this contract negotiation time, it was tense. Alaska Airlines was a small-ish company. And suddenly, not everyone was on the same side.

BIGELOW: And so they had their people who were either married to or friends with or whatever from different departments, and so they were getting information. I'm sure they weren't...

FOUNTAIN: Ooh, there were spies in your ranks.

BIGELOW: There were spies in the ranks. Yes, indeed.

MALONE: To avoid spies, David and Gail had started to hold secret strategy meetings. And really, the focus was trying to find a way around this sort of impossible problem, which was, if the flight attendants go on strike, Alaska Airlines is just going to use the TWA strategy and replace all of the flight attendants. David says they knew they needed a counterstrategy.

BORER: Of course. Sun Tzu says you don't attack your opponents directly, you attack their strategy.

MALONE: Were you literally the guy quoting Sun Tzu's "The Art Of War" at the union organizing meeting?

BORER: Oh, yeah.

MALONE: (Laughter).

BORER: Call me crazy, but, I mean, there's a lot in there. This idea of attacking their strategy was, like, directly applicable.

MALONE: Attack the airline's strategy. Now, remember, the TWA move was to effectively fire everyone without technically firing anyone. Well, David and Gail thought, what if there is a way for us to effectively go on strike without actually going on strike?

FOUNTAIN: In other words, what if they could create the impact of a strike without the risk of a strike? On June 19, 1993, the union calls a press conference.

MARY JO MANZANARES: There's a bunch of chairs. There are people in chairs. There are cameras.

FOUNTAIN: Mary Jo Manzanares was acting as a union spokesperson at that press conference.

MARY JO: There are print reporters, there's television reporters. The big question, of course, was, what were we going to do next?

MALONE: What were they going to do next? And if you were one of the reporters there, it was totally reasonable to expect the big announcement to be the Alaska flight attendants are going on strike. But what happens instead is pretty incredible. Mary Jo walks up to the microphone and basically says, we are not going on strike yet. We will strike, but we aren't telling anyone any of the details.

FOUNTAIN: Here's Mary Jo making the announcement back then.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARY JO: So where do we strike, when do we strike, what do we strike? I don't know, and none of you know. And none of management knows. And none of the traveling public knows.

MALONE: The union's thinking was that Alaska Airlines couldn't replace the striking flight attendants if they weren't actually striking yet.

FOUNTAIN: And yet, the announcement made that threat of a strike very real. Mary Jo was at the podium saying that they could strike at any moment on any flight.

MALONE: She told the crowd of reporters that the union was calling this strategy CHAOS, which she was quick to point out was an acronym.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARY JO: Create havoc around our system.

MALONE: Create havoc around our system. And you can think of the CHAOS strategy as, like, guerilla warfare. You know, when you're up against a bigger, more powerful opponent, you keep them scrambling. You carefully pick the moment you're going to attack. Hopefully, that forces your opponent to prepare for anything and everything constantly.

FOUNTAIN: And you know who loves a good guerilla warfare, airline chaos story?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: Now, live at 11 o'clock, KOMO News 4.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Good evening, everyone. If you fly Alaska Airlines, a labor dispute might affect your travel plans.

FOUNTAIN: The television news.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Alaska flight attendants are threatening to create chaos this summer for passengers aboard the airline.

MALONE: Yeah. I mean, this was made-for-TV-news stuff. What's a better story than CHAOS in the skies, or pay us or CHAOS?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: We just don't know when this stoppage or slowdown or disruption of service is going to occur, but it could happen literally any moment, David (ph).

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: And of course, that's the tactic of the flight attendants, is not to let anybody know, that threat that something might happen at some time. Has it had any effect on bookings by the airline?

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: As a matter of fact, it has. The company wouldn't get into specifics, give us absolute numbers, but they did concede today that, yes, the number of bookings is down because of this.

MALONE: Yes, the bookings were going down, and this was key. The union was basically getting the benefits of a strike without suffering the consequences.

FOUNTAIN: Right 'cause if you think about the way a normal strike works, it's all about inflicting economic harm on your opponent. So, like, the company won't make any money because their workers have walked off the job, but also, those workers aren't getting paid either. Normally, both sides are taking the financial hit.

MALONE: But with the flight attendants here, their airline was losing bookings because of the strike threat. And yet, the Alaska flight attendants weren't actually striking yet, so Alaska still had to pay them. And if CHAOS was the strategy, flight attendant and union negotiator Gail Bigelow says it was working better than she had ever expected.

BIGELOW: I had people calling me at my home saying, oh, I have tickets to take my kids to Disneyland. Please don't strike my flight. I mean, people I barely knew. And...

(LAUGHTER)

BIGELOW: ...So it was working.

FOUNTAIN: CHAOS was working. No one knew what would happen next, says union lawyer David Borer.

BORER: And that was part of the strategy - was to keep them guessing. Sun Tzu - to go back to Sun Tzu - says a confused enemy is easily defeated. I know it's corny and everything, but strikes are so much like warfare that it's actually directly applicable.

FOUNTAIN: Now, this whole not striking but threatening to strike thing - this was just phase one of the CHAOS strategy because the union knew this phase could only last so long. Like, eventually they would become the flight attendants who cried strike over and over, and people would stop taking their threat seriously. Phase two of CHAOS was coming - a real strike somewhere, sometime, just eventually.

MALONE: In the meantime, Alaska Airlines - they were preparing for that moment. Greg Witter was a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines at the time, and he was in the boardroom helping to figure out Alaska's plan, their countermove, for when those strikes finally did begin.

GREG WITTER: In preparation for the fact that there could be a strike, all the management personnel were trained as flight attendants so that if there is...

MALONE: Including you?

WITTER: Including me. Yep. Yeah, I went off to three weeks of flight attendant training.

MALONE: Tell me about going to flight attendant school. Yeah.

WITTER: Oh, very intense.

MALONE: Intense because, of course, being a flight attendant is so much more than safety demos and handing out little bags of pretzels or whatever.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah. Greg says he had to practice for an emergency landing, pass a pretty rigorous swim test, memorize a phonebook-size safety manual.

WITTER: You've got to learn, basically, every inch of every aircraft you fly. You got to know the least-risk bomb location and...

FOUNTAIN: The what?

WITTER: Latches for this - oh, the least-risk bomb location. So if someone on the plane says they've got a bomb in the bag, and you're able to wrest that bag away from them, where can you put that bomb on the aircraft where it would do the least damage if it went off.

FOUNTAIN: That's a thing? What?

WITTER: That is the thing. Absolutely. The least-risk bomb location - absolutely a thing.

MALONE: And what is the least-risk bomb location? I mean, should we even tell people this, Nick? Is this dangerous information?

FOUNTAIN: It's helpful information.

MALONE: OK, OK. Greg says it's usually behind the engine. Least-risk bomb location - behind the engine. There you go.

FOUNTAIN: So Alaska was training people like Greg, the press guy, and hundreds of other manager types not to become full-time replacements, but as stopgap attendants for the moment the union finally started to strike.

MALONE: Yeah, right because Alaska Airlines was worried about the strike starting, like, in the middle of the flight or something. And so they actually started booking seats for Greg and this crew of managers trained to be flight attendants onto as many flights as possible. You know, that way, if the strike did start mid-flight, one of those people could jump up and suddenly become a flight attendant.

FOUNTAIN: Greg says he was assigned to literally just sit on the flight from Seattle to Guadalajara, Mexico, over and over again. At one point, he says, he even got pulled aside by the Mexican authorities.

WITTER: I just - I remember my heart was pounding when they hauled me into the backroom. And I thought, oh, my God, I know exactly what they're thinking here. And I presume they thought I was a drug mule of some kind.

FOUNTAIN: Sure.

WITTER: Like, who's this guy that keeps flying from Seattle to Guadalajara every four days, you know?

MALONE: Now, having Greg and lots of other management people flying around and sitting at airports - this was just a way to temporarily keep flights going when the big strike eventually did happen.

FOUNTAIN: But Alaska's bigger move was going to be the TWA strategy. As soon as the attendants walked off the job, Alaska could replace them with an army of new flight attendants.

MALONE: Of course, Alaska had to hire that army. They had to find a whole new workforce. And so Alaska held a giant job fair - even sent their assistant vice president of employee relations to this thing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We are going through the selection process to put people into training for future openings. And, of course...

MALONE: This, by the way, is the weirdest job fair I have ever heard about. For one, remember, Alaska didn't have any jobs to fill yet since no one was striking yet. But also, there are people picketing the job fair, and reporters are asking the job fair attendees basically, like, hey, don't you feel bad signing up to take a job from someone who's going to go on strike?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I'm not worried about them. I got a wife and kids to support. You know, that's their problem.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I don't know them, so - if I knew them personally, it'd probably hurt. But I don't, so it doesn't bother me.

FOUNTAIN: OK, so our two sides have their strategies. The flight attendants have CHAOS, their constant strike threat without actually striking yet.

MALONE: And then, Alaska is preparing for the moment that flight attendants finally do strike, preparing to go full TWA, hiring their army of replacements.

After the break, the strike begins.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: The CHAOS campaign had two phases - phase one, threaten to strike at any moment and then phase two, actually strike, actually have flight attendants walk off the job.

FOUNTAIN: Two months into the campaign, they decided it was time to move into phase two. Gail Bigelow had been collecting the names of her fellow flight attendants who were willing to walk off the job, and they got put on what she called the Guts List.

BIGELOW: They'd have the guts to do it, yes. It was - that's the Guts List.

FOUNTAIN: 'Cause going on strike as a flight attendant very likely meant getting permanently replaced, you know, because of the looming TWA strategy.

BIGELOW: Well, it was frightening for me because I was in a position to try to encourage the flight attendants to strike.

FOUNTAIN: You were asking them to make a - take a crazy risk. They might all lose their jobs.

BIGELOW: It was a crazy risk, yes.

MALONE: It was also this huge puzzle for the flight attendants. Phase two of CHAOS meant actually going on strike. And yet, the moment a flight attendant walked off the job, Alaska was allowed to replace them, pull the old TWA move.

FOUNTAIN: Gail and the union team thought they just might have discovered a way around this, a way to strike without getting replaced.

MALONE: Yeah, it was a very clever, very chaotic kind of countermove to the entire TWA strategy, but they couldn't be sure that it would work until they actually tried it.

FOUNTAIN: The moment of truth came on August 20, 1993, and the whole thing unfolded like a SEAL Team Six mission or something.

MALONE: The target? A fully booked 6 p.m. flight leaving out of Alaska's hub in Seattle. That flight had a crew who had signed up for the Guts List.

FOUNTAIN: One of those flight attendants was Jennifer Price. She says it was a seemingly normal day. She was at the airport when a union official walked up to her and said...

JENNIFER PRICE: OK, Jennifer, we've chosen your crew. You will be striking your flight.

MALONE: Jennifer calmly gets on the plane, stows her baggage, does the preflight checks.

FOUNTAIN: She's there with her fellow flight attendants, Chris (ph) and Barb (ph).

PRICE: The boarding agent came down to the plane and said, are you ready to board? And Barb said, no, we are not ready to board. On the advice of our union, we're engaging in strike action, and we won't be available to perform our work assignment (laughter). And you could see the agent's eyes getting bigger. And then she said, you're kidding. No, I'm not. And we grabbed our suitcases and walked off the airplane.

MALONE: Jennifer and her crew walked past the passengers who were all ready to board. She says they looked confused. They looked like they were getting worried.

FOUNTAIN: And at this exact moment, Gail Bigelow, who's back at strike headquarters, sends a fax to Alaska Airlines saying, we are writing to inform you that we are striking this one flight, Flight 536 out of Seattle's airport.

MALONE: There it was. The strike had officially begun. Yes, it was just one flight crew on one flight. But this was the moment Alaska Airlines had been preparing for.

FOUNTAIN: Yeah, an emergency team of those managers that were trained to be flight attendants jumps into action to sub in for that striking flight crew.

MALONE: But of course, the bigger Alaska strategy was the TWA strategy. As long as Jennifer and her crew were on strike, Alaska was allowed to permanently fill the positions they just walked out on - to effectively fire Jennifer while she's on strike.

FOUNTAIN: But after just 28 minutes of the strike, Gail Bigelow sends a second fax to Alaska Airlines saying, actually, strike's over now.

MALONE: And here's why that is a genius move. Alaska hadn't actually managed to get the paperwork together or whatever it would take to permanently replace Jennifer's flight crew during that 28-minute strike window. That crew was no longer on strike, and so the union was pretty sure Jennifer's group of attendants was now safe from getting TWAed (ph), from getting replaced. Here's Gail Bigelow again.

BIGELOW: The three of them came back to strike headquarters then. And I can remember the picture of them, and they were all very relieved to be in strike headquarters, knowing that they were going to get their jobs back.

MALONE: Flight attendant Jennifer Price remembers that moment - walking back into headquarters that night.

PRICE: Oh, yeah, they cheered. We were the heroes of the day. It was - you know, that was helpful (laughter).

FOUNTAIN: The kind of strike that happened that night, it has a technical name. It's called intermittent striking.

MALONE: Yeah. You know, the idea is instead of everyone going on strike and then staying on strike, you do a bunch of little strikes. In this case, you strike one flight at a time and just for a tiny window of time. And the union was hoping that this would make it incredibly hard for Alaska to actually catch and permanently replace attendants while they were on strike.

FOUNTAIN: And the flight attendants kept attacking this way. Four days later, they struck a flight out of Vegas, then hit five Bay Area flights on the same day.

MALONE: And it was chaos every time this happened. Alaska had to scramble to get their managers onto these flights as flight attendants. Alaska spokesperson Greg Witter remembers being at Seattle's airport when somebody from his company comes, like, running up to him.

WITTER: We have a walk-off. And it was me and two guys from marketing. We were hailed. You guys got to go work a flight. Oh, my God. All three of us - the blood drained out of our faces.

FOUNTAIN: So Greg rushes to get on the flight, and then he realizes he's going to have to give the iconic safety demo.

WITTER: My heart literally was about coming through my throat while I'm doing this safety demonstration. I had cold sweats. Oh, my God. My palms were all sweaty and clammy. It was terrible.

FOUNTAIN: How many flights do you think you did that day?

WITTER: One, two, three. God, I think probably at least three until we got to fly home.

FOUNTAIN: Greg can't exactly remember because it was a total mess. It was clearly an unsustainable solution for Alaska, and it had been just three weeks of this intermittent striking.

MALONE: In the end, here is how this whole tactic-countertactic battle wound down. In what feels a little like an act of desperation, Alaska Airlines said, you know what? We think this intermittent striking thing - we think it's actually not allowed. So forget being replaced. If you do this, you're going to get straight-up fired. The union took Alaska Airlines to court, and the court sided with the union. They said intermittent striking is protected by law.

FOUNTAIN: And the union's like, OK then. We're going to keep doing these intermittent strikes until we get a decent contract. Less than two weeks later, Alaska proposed what Gail thought was pretty decent contract.

MALONE: Gail had been at this for more than three years, and just like that, it was over.

BIGELOW: I was like, oh, my gosh. I have my life back (laughter). I mean, really, that's how I felt. I have my life back. But I - but in seriousness, I felt really good about it. I felt the contract was a good contract.

MALONE: David Borer, the Sun-Tzu-quoting lawyer, agrees. He says the new contract was phenomenal for the flight attendants.

FOUNTAIN: So it was a great victory in your head.

BORER: Yeah, like the poster on my wall, total victory. No, I mean, we didn't lose a single job. Nobody who struck lost any income. And we got a contract with a 60% raise that we hadn't even asked for.

FOUNTAIN: David thinks it was the most successful labor strike of a generation. And he says the CHAOS strategy has kept working for the union. Since that Alaska flight, not a single flight attendant from David's union has had to strike in the U.S. The mere threat of CHAOS has been enough.

MALONE: And I suppose it is reasonable at this point to then wonder, why doesn't every strike use this exact same CHAOS playbook? It seems like the obvious thing to do.

FOUNTAIN: Well, the answer to that one is a little in the weeds. So airline strikes and, actually, railroad strikes, too, have one set of rules. But most other strikes are governed by a different set of rules. And those rules don't allow for this kind of intermittent on-again, off-again striking.

MALONE: Yeah. So for instance, we've got this United Auto Workers strike happening right now. Once the UAW announces, for example, that the Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., is now on strike, well, those workers are going to need to be on strike until the dispute is over. They're not allowed to 20 minutes later, say, oh, hey, never mind. This plant's strike is over.

FOUNTAIN: But what has been really interesting to watch are the ways that the UAW and their president, Shawn Fain, do really seem to be introducing CHAOS where they're allowed to. Attorney David Borer has noticed this too.

BORER: Nobody's asking Shawn Fain, oh, how long do you think you can hold out? They're all saying, oh, when are you going to strike the next plant? And that's exactly how it was with Alaska.

FOUNTAIN: Right. Because what the UAW has done is start by striking at three auto factories, and then it has added a strike at a factory somewhere else, and then at somewhere else and then somewhere else. The rhythm of this UAW strike is sounding a lot like the CHAOS strike from 30 years ago.

MALONE: Yeah, it's funny. I was driving to work the other day and heard a report from our colleague Camila Domonoske about the UAW strike. Here, we'll play a little bit of it for you.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

CAMILA DOMONOSKE: No one knows how long these strikes will last or what kinds of locations could be targeted next or even which companies. The union has said...

MALONE: So, yeah, I heard that. And I just thought, like, wow, that sounds so similar to that wild press conference 30 years ago when the Alaska flight attendants first introduced CHAOS to the world of labor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: So where do we strike? When do we strike? What do we strike? I don't know, and none of you know, and none of management knows and none of the traveling public knows.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
I am mildly obsessed with these moments in history, specifically sports history.
When somebody looks at the way everybody is doing something and says, but wait a second,
what if I tried it this totally unexpected other way?
You know, famously in high jump, a guy named Dick Fosbury started jumping over the
bar backwards and it was so effective that now everyone does it.
Or in baseball.
At some point, a very clever player was like, what if instead of swinging at a fast moving
ball, what if I just hold the bat up to where the ball is gonna be and knock it frustratingly
into the infield?
And the bunt is born.
Love the bunt.
And look, I'm obsessed with these moments because it forces everyone to be like,
wait a second, can they do that?
That can't be legal.
But yeah, it is.
And the game has changed forever.
And Kenny, of course, these moments don't just happen in sporting competition.
They happen in our world too, the world of economics and business.
And there's an example that has become particularly relevant right now.
Yeah.
So we're in the middle of what people have been calling hot labor summer.
I guess it's turned into, I don't know, unseasonably warm labor fall or whatever.
But yes, we are seeing this spate of labor actions across the country, strikes in
Hollywood, at hospitals and schools, at car factories.
And you know, strikes are not so different from sports.
They both have chanting and people holding up punny signs.
But more importantly, they also have competing teams employing tactics and counter tactics
and counter counter tactics.
In other words, labor is kind of exactly the right kind of situation for the right
person to come along and jump backwards over the way things are supposed to work and
change labor disputes forever.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Kenny Malone.
And I'm Nick Fountain.
And if you had to pick a Fosbury Flop Bunt moment in labor history, a decent
candidate might be what happened 30 years ago when one airline went to war with
a group of scrappy flight attendants.
Today on the show, the story of what happened when a union figured out how to
strike without really going on strike.
It seemed too good to be true.
There were legal challenges.
There were shady flights to Guadalajara.
And arguably, it's a case study that is still shaping the labor disputes we see
today.

Before we get into our story, you have to understand this enormous threat that
has been hanging over airline unions for the last three and a half decades.
Yeah, we're going to call it the TWA threat because in 1986, the flight
attendants for Trans World Airlines, also known as TWA, were in a labor
dispute with their airline and it was looking like they were going to have
to strike.
And, you know, the thing about a strike is if you generally follow all the rules
and the letter of the law, the government protects that labor action.
Like you are not allowed to be fired when you're striking.
That's the deal.
So great.
The TWA flight attendants went on strike.
But what was so notable about what happened in 1986 is that TWA found a
legal workaround, a way to effectively fire all those striking flight
attendants without technically firing anyone.
Apparently, when a flight attendant walked off the job, went on strike,
it was legal for TWA to fill that newly vacated position.
TWA wasn't actually firing anyone.
But the flight attendant that went on strike, well, they would have to
wait until another position opened up.
And of course, until that happened, that flight attendant was functionally
fired.
They weren't working.
They weren't earning a paycheck.
And the TWA move in 1986 was to do this on a massive scale.
When the flight attendants went on strike, the company started replacing
them, thousands of people.
It would take years before a new TWA job would open up for most of them.
They were they were all replaced by scabs.
The sanitized term for it is permanent replacements.
But you're a labor lawyer, so you call them scabs, sure.
That's right.
This is longtime labor lawyer David Borer.
It was horrifying.
And you look at that and you think, oh my gosh, we can't ever let this
happen again.
David was watching this TWA fiasco carefully because back then, he was
just starting out as the union lawyer for a different group of flight
attendants, which included the ones that our story is about today, the
flight attendants of Alaska Airlines.
At Alaska Airlines, we discount fares, but we never discount service.
So we pick up a handful of years after the TWA stuff.
It's 1993.
David was negotiating the new contract for those Alaska Airlines
flight attendants.
And David says negotiations were not going very well.
And so he and the flight attendants, they had started meeting
to discuss what to do next.
We spent the better part of a week talking about strategy.
And we knew the guiding thing behind all of it was we can't do what the
TWA flight attendants did.
Right.
Because now all of the airlines have the TWA playbook.
So if your flight attendants go on strike, you just use the old TWA
move and replace those pesky strikers.
One of the people David was strategizing with.
Good morning, Nick.
It's Gail Bigelow.
Gail Bigelow was an Alaska Airlines flight attendant and one of the
union's lead negotiators.
And she says this contract negotiation time, it was tense.
Alaska Airlines was a smallish company and suddenly not everyone
was on the same side.
And so they had their people who were either married to or friends
with or whatever from different departments.
And so they were getting information.
I'm sure they weren't.
There were spies in your ranks.
There were spies in the ranks.
Yes, indeed.
To avoid spies, David and Gail had started to hold secret strategy
meetings and really the focus was trying to find a way around this
sort of impossible problem, which was if the flight attendants go
on strike, Alaska Airlines is just going to use the TWA strategy and
replace all of the flight attendants.
David says they knew they needed a counter strategy.
Of course, Sun Tzu says you don't attack your opponents directly.
You attack their strategy.
Were you literally the guy quoting Sun Tzu's The Art of War at
the union organizing meeting?
Oh, yeah.
Call me crazy.
But I mean, there's a lot in there.
This idea of attacking their strategy was like directly applicable.
Attack the airline's strategy.
Now, remember, the TWA move was to effectively fire everyone
without technically firing anyone.
Well, David and Gail thought, what if there is a way for us to
effectively go on strike without actually going on strike?
In other words, what if they could create the impact of a
strike without the risk of a strike?
On June 19th, 1993, the union calls a press conference.
There's a bench of chairs.
There are people in chairs.
Mary Jo Manzanares was acting as a union spokesperson
at that press conference.
There are print reporters.
There's television reporters.
The big question, of course, was what were we going to do next?
What were they going to do next?
And if you were one of the reporters there, it was totally
reasonable to expect the big announcement to be the Alaska
flight attendants are going on strike.
But what happens instead is pretty incredible.
Mary Jo walks up to the microphone and basically says,
we are not going on strike yet.
We will strike, but we aren't telling anyone any of the
details.
Here's Mary Jo making the announcement back then.
So where do we strike?
When do we strike?
What do we strike?
I don't know.
And none of you know.
And none of management knows.
And none of the traveling public knows.
The union's thinking was that Alaska airlines couldn't
replace the striking flight attendants if they weren't
actually striking yet.
And yet, the announcement made that threat of a strike
very real.
Mary Jo was at the podium saying that they could strike
at any moment on any flight.
She told the crowd of reporters that the union was
calling this strategy chaos, which she was quick to
point out was an acronym.
Create havoc around our system.
Create havoc around our system.
And you can think of the chaos strategy as like
guerrilla warfare.
You know, when you're up against a bigger, more powerful
opponent, you keep them scrambling.
You carefully pick the moment you're going to attack.
Hopefully, that forces your opponent to prepare for
anything and everything constantly.
And you know who loves a good guerrilla warfare
airline chaos story?
Now, live at 11 o'clock, Como News 4.
Good evening, everyone.
If you fly Alaska Airlines, the labor...
The television news.
Alaska flight attendants are threatening to create
chaos this summer for passengers aboard the airline.
Yeah, I mean, this was made for TV news stuff.
What's a better story than chaos in the skies or
pay us or chaos?
We just don't know when this stoppage or slowdown
or disruption of service is going to occur, but it
could happen literally any moment, David.
And of course, that's the tactic of the flight
attendants is not to let anybody know that
threat that something might happen at some time.
Has it had any effect on bookings by the airline?
As a matter of fact, it has the company would
get into specifics, give us absolute numbers, but
they did concede today that, yes, the number
of bookings is down because of this.
Yes, the bookings were going down.
And this was key.
The union was basically getting the benefits of
a strike without suffering the consequences.
Right, because if you think about the way a
normal strike works, it's all about inflicting
economic harm on your opponent.
So like the company won't make any money
because their workers have walked off the job.
But also those workers aren't getting paid either.
Normally, both sides are taking the financial
hit. But but with the flight attendants here,
their airline was losing bookings because
of the strike threat.
And yet the Alaska flight attendants weren't
actually striking yet.
So Alaska still had to pay them.
And if chaos was the strategy, flight attendant
and union negotiator Gail Bigelow says it was
working better than she had ever expected.
I had I had people calling me at my home
saying, oh, I have tickets to take my kids
to Disneyland.
Please don't strike my flight.
I mean, people I barely knew.
And and so it was working.
Chaos was working.
No one knew what would happen next, says
union lawyer David Borer.
And that was part of the part of the strategy
was to keep them guessing.
Sun Tzu to go back to Sun Tzu says a confused
enemy is easily defeated.
I know it's corny and everything, but strikes
are so much like warfare that it's it's
actually directly applicable.
Now, this whole not striking but threatening
to strike thing, this was just phase one
of the chaos strategy because the union
knew this phase could only last so long.
Like eventually they would become the flight
attendants who cried strike over and over
and people would stop taking their threats seriously.
Phase two of chaos was coming a real strike
somewhere, sometime, just eventually.
In the meantime, Alaska Airlines,
they were preparing for that moment.
Greg Witter was a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines
at the time.
And he was in the boardroom helping to figure out
Alaska's plan, their counter move for when
those strikes finally did begin.
In preparation for the fact that there
could be a strike, all the management personnel
were trained as flight attendants.
So that if they're- Including you?
Including me, yep.
Yeah, I went off to three weeks of flight
attendant training.
Tell me about going to flight attendance school.
Yeah.
Very intense.
Intense because of course being a flight
attendant is so much more than safety demos
and handing out little bags of pretzels or whatever.
Yeah, Greg says he had to practice
for an emergency landing,
pass a pretty rigorous swim test,
memorize a phone book-sized safety manual.
You've got to learn basically every inch
of every aircraft you fly.
You got to know the least risk bomb location and-
The what?
Latches for this.
Oh, the least risk bomb location.
So if someone on the plane says they've got a bomb
in the bag and you're able to rest that bag away
from them, where can you put that bomb on the aircraft
where it would do the least damage if it went off?
That's a thing?
What?
That is a thing, absolutely.
The least risk bomb location, absolutely a thing.
And what is the least risk bomb location?
Wait, should we even tell people this, Nick?
Is this dangerous information?
It's helpful information.
Okay, okay.
Greg says it's usually behind the engine.
Least risk bomb location, behind the engine.
There you go.
So Alaska was training people like Greg the press guy
and hundreds of other manager types,
not to become full-time replacements,
but as stopgap attendants for the moment
the union finally started to strike.
Yeah, right.
Because Alaska Airlines was worried about the strike
starting in the middle of the flight or something.
And so they actually started booking seats for Greg
and this crew of managers trained to be flight attendants
onto as many flights as possible.
That way, if the strike did start mid-flight,
one of those people could jump up
and suddenly become a flight attendant.
Greg says he was assigned to literally
just sit on the flight from Seattle to Guadalajara, Mexico
over and over again.
At one point, he says he even got pulled aside
by the Mexican authorities.
I just, I remember my heart was pounding
when they hauled me into the back room
and I thought, oh my God,
I know exactly what they're thinking here.
And I presume they thought it was a drug deal
of some kind. Sure.
Who's this guy that keeps flying
from Seattle to Guadalajara every four days, you know?
Now having Greg and lots of other management people
flying around and sitting at airports,
this was just a way to temporarily keep flights going
when the big strike eventually did happen.
But Alaska's bigger move was gonna be the TWA strategy.
As soon as the attendants walked off the job,
Alaska could replace them
with an army of new flight attendants.
Of course, Alaska had to hire that army.
They had to find a whole new workforce.
And so Alaska held a giant job fair,
even sent their assistant vice president
of employee relations to this thing.
We are going through the selection process
to put people into training for future openings.
This, by the way, is the weirdest job fair
I have ever heard about.
For one, remember, Alaska didn't have any jobs
to fill yet, since no one was striking yet.
But also, there are people picketing the job fair
and reporters are asking the job fair attendees
basically like, hey, don't you feel bad
signing up to take a job from someone
who's gonna go on strike?
I'm not worried about them.
I got a wife and kids to support, you know,
that's their problem.
I don't know them, so if I knew them personally,
it'd probably hurt, but I know it,
so it doesn't bother me.
Okay, so our two sides have their strategies.
The flight attendants have chaos,
their constant strike threat without actually striking yet.
And then Alaska is preparing for the moment
that flight attendants finally do strike,
preparing to go full TWA,
hiring their army of replacements.
After the break, the strike begins.

The chaos campaign had two phases.
Phase one, threaten to strike at any moment.
And then phase two, actually strike,
actually have flight attendants walk off the job.
Two months into the campaign,
they decided it was time to move into phase two.
Gail Bigelow had been collecting the names
of her fellow flight attendants
who were willing to walk off the job.
And they got put on what she called the guts list.
They'd have the guts to do it.
Yes, that's the guts list.
Because going on strike as a flight attendant
very likely meant getting permanently replaced.
You know, because of the looming TWA strategy.
Well, it was frightening for me
because I was in a position
to try to encourage the flight attendants to strike.
You were asking them to take a crazy risk.
They might all lose their jobs.
It was a crazy risk, yes.
It was also this huge puzzle for the flight attendants.
Phase two of chaos meant actually going on strike.
And yet, the moment a flight attendant walked off the job,
Alaska was allowed to replace them, pull the old TWA move.
Gail and the union team thought
they just might have discovered a way around this.
A way to strike without getting replaced.
Yeah, it was a very clever,
very chaotic kind of counter move
to the entire TWA strategy,
but they couldn't be sure that it would work
until they actually tried it.
The moment of truth came on August 20th, 1993,
and the whole thing unfolded
like a SEAL Team Six mission or something.
The target, a fully booked 6 p.m. flight
leaving out of Alaska's hub in Seattle.
That flight had a crew who had signed up
for the guts list.
One of those flight attendants was Jennifer Price.
She says it was a seemingly normal day,
she was at the airport,
when a union official walked up to her and said,
okay, Jennifer, we've chosen your crew,
you will be striking your flight.
Jennifer calmly gets on the plane,
stows her baggage, does the pre-flight checks.
She's there with her fellow flight attendants,
Chris and Barb.
The boarding agent came down to the plane
and said, are you ready to board?
And Barb said, no, we are not ready to board.
On the advice of our union,
we're engaging in strike action
and we won't be available to perform our work assignment.
And you could see the agent's eyes getting bigger.
And then she said, you're kidding.
No, I'm not.
And we grabbed our suitcases
and walked off the airplane.
Jennifer and her crew walked past the passengers
who were all ready to board.
She says they looked confused,
they looked like they were getting worried.
And at this exact moment,
Gail Bigelow, who's back at strike headquarters,
sends a fax to Alaska Airlines saying,
we are writing to inform you
that we are striking this one flight,
flight 536 out of Seattle's airport.
There it was, the strike had officially begun.
Yes, it was just one flight crew on one flight,
but this was the moment
Alaska Airlines had been preparing for.
Yeah, an emergency team of those managers
that were trained to be flight attendants
jumps into action to sub in for that striking flight crew.
But of course, the bigger Alaska strategy
was the TWA strategy.
As long as Jennifer and her crew were on strike,
Alaska was allowed to permanently fill the positions
they'd just walked out on
to effectively fire Jennifer while she's on strike.
But after just 28 minutes of the strike,
Gail Bigelow sends a second fax to Alaska Airlines
saying, actually, strike's over now.
And here's why that is a genius move.
Alaska hadn't actually managed to get the paperwork together
or whatever it would take
to permanently replace Jennifer's flight crew
during that 28-minute strike window.
That crew was no longer on strike,
and so the union was pretty sure.
Jennifer's group of attendants was now safe
from getting TWA'd, from getting replaced.
Here's Gail Bigelow again.
The three of them came back to strike headquarters then,
and I can remember the picture of them,
and they were all very relieved
to be in strike headquarters
knowing that they were going to get their jobs back.
Flight attendant Jennifer Price remembers that moment,
walking back into headquarters that night.
Oh yeah, they cheered.
We were the heroes of the day.
It was, you know, that was helpful.
The kind of strike that happened that night,
it has a technical name.
It's called intermittent striking.
Yeah, you know, the idea is,
instead of everyone going on strike
and then staying on strike,
you do a bunch of little strikes.
In this case, you strike one flight at a time
and just for a tiny window of time,
and the union was hoping
that this would make it incredibly hard
for Alaska to actually catch
and permanently replace attendants
while they were on strike.
And the flight attendants kept attacking this way.
Four days later, they struck a flight out of Vegas,
then hit five Bay Area flights on the same day.
And it was chaos every time this happened.
Alaska had to scramble to get their managers
onto these flights as flight attendants.
Alaska spokesperson Greg Witter remembers
being at Seattle's airport
when somebody from his company
comes like running up to him.
We have a lock off.
And it was me and two guys from marketing.
We were hailed.
You guys got to go work a flight.
Oh my God, all three of us,
the blood drained out of our faces.
So Greg rushes to get on the flight.
And then he realizes he's gonna have to give
the iconic safety demo.
My heart literally was about coming through my throat
while I'm doing this safety demonstration.
I had cold sweats.
Oh my God, my palms were all sweaty and clammy.
It was terrible.
How many flights do you think you did that day?
One, two, three.
God, I think probably at least three
until we got to fly home.
Greg can't exactly remember because it was a total mess.
It was clearly an unsustainable solution for Alaska.
And it had been just three weeks
of this intermittent striking.
In the end, here is how this whole
tactic counter-tactic battle wound down.
In what feels a little like an act of desperation,
Alaska Airlines said, you know what?
We think this intermittent striking thing,
we think it's actually not allowed.
So forget being replaced.
If you do this, you're gonna get straight up fired.
The union took Alaska Airlines to court
and the court sided with the union.
They said intermittent striking is protected by law.
And the union's like, okay then,
we're gonna keep doing these intermittent strikes
until we get a decent contract.
Less than two weeks later, Alaska proposed
what Gail thought was pretty decent contract.
Gail had been at this for more than three years.
And just like that, it was over.
I was like, oh my gosh, I have my life back.
I mean, really, that's how I felt.
I have my life back.
But in seriousness, I felt really good about it.
I felt the contract was a good contract.
David Borer, the Sun Tzu quoting lawyer agrees.
He says the new contract was phenomenal
for the flight attendants.
So it was a great victory in your head.
Yeah, like the poster on my wall.
Total victory.
I mean, we didn't lose a single job.
Nobody who struck lost any income.
And we got a contract with a 60% raise
that we hadn't even asked for.
David thinks it was the most successful labor strike
of a generation.
And he says the chaos strategy
has kept working for the union.
Since that Alaska flight,
not a single flight attendant from David's union
has had to strike in the US.
The mere threat of chaos has been enough.
And I suppose it is reasonable at this point
to then wonder why doesn't every strike
use this exact same chaos playbook?
It seems like the obvious thing to do.
Well, the answer to that one is a little in the weeds.
So airline strikes and actually railroad strikes too
have one set of rules.
But most other strikes are governed
by a different set of rules.
And those rules don't allow
for this kind of intermittent on again, off again striking.
Yeah, so for instance,
we've got this United Auto Workers strike
happening right now.
Once the UAW announces, for example,
that the Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan
is now on strike,
well, those workers are gonna need to be on strike
until the dispute is over.
They're not allowed to 20 minutes later say,
oh, hey, nevermind, this plant strike is over.
But what has been really interesting to watch
are the ways that the UAW and their president Sean Fain
do really seem to be introducing chaos
where they're allowed to.
Attorney David Boer has noticed this too.
Nobody's asking Sean Fain,
well, how long do you think you can hold out?
They're all saying,
oh, when are you gonna strike the next plant?
And that's exactly how it was with Alaska.
Right, because what the UAW has done
is start by striking at three auto factories
and then it has added a strike
at a factory somewhere else.
And then it's somewhere else and then somewhere else.
The rhythm of this UAW strike is sounding a lot
like the chaos strike from 30 years ago.
Yeah, it's funny.
I was driving to work the other day
and heard a report from our colleague,
Kamila Domenosky about the UAW strike.
Here, we'll play a little bit of it for you.
No one knows how long these strikes will last
or what kinds of locations could be targeted next
or even which companies.
The union has said-
So yeah, I heard that
and I just thought like, wow,
that sounds so similar to that wild press conference
30 years ago when the Alaska flight attendants
first introduced chaos to the world of labor.
So where do we strike?
When do we strike?
What do we strike?
I don't know.
And none of you know.
And none of management knows.
And none of the traveling public knows.
