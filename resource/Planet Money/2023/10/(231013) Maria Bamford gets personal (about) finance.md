Comedian Maria Bamford.
Robyn Von Swank/Maria Bamford

Note: There is swearing in this episode.

In 2017, The University of Minnesota asked comedian Maria Bamford to give their commencement speech. But the University may not have known what it was in for. In her speech, Bamford told the crowd of graduates how much the university offered to pay her (nothing), her counteroffer ($20,000), and the amount they settled on ($10,000), which (after taxes and fees, etc.) she gave away to students in the audience to pay down their student loans.

Maria Bamford is a big believer in full disclosure of her finances, a philosophy she's adopted after decades in a Debtors Anonymous support group. In meetings, she learned important financial tips and tricks to go from thousands of dollars in debt to her current net worth of $3.5 million (a number which, true to her philosophy, she will share with anyone).

She spoke with us about her financial issues, how she recovered, and why she believes in total financial transparency, even when it makes her look kinda bad.

MARY CHILDS, HOST:

Just a quick note before we get started, someone does swear in this episode just one time. It is a comedian, though, so I feel like just one swear is doing pretty good. OK, here's the show.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

You may have heard comedian Maria Bamford's voice on "SpongeBob SquarePants."

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS")

MARIA BAMFORD: (As character) Hey, uncle SpongeBob.

(SOUNDBITE OF RECORD SCRATCHING)

CHILDS: Or seen her on "Arrested Development."

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT")

RON HOWARD: (As Narrator) Tobias had found a friend.

BAMFORD: (As DeBrie) You're neat.

DAVID CROSS: (As Tobias) You're neat.

BAMFORD: (As DeBrie) (Laughter) You're neat.

MALONE: Or maybe you saw her in some Target commercials.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: (As character) We all know there is no I in team, but there is an I in Christmas. And at the Target two-day sale...

CHILDS: But for, like, the past five or six years, we at PLANET MONEY have been talking about Maria Bamford's work as a commencement speaker.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: Let us begin at the beginning. I will read a section of the email sent to me by the university. Quote...

CHILDS: In 2017, the University of Minnesota asked Maria Bamford to give their commencement speech. It is unclear, though, if they asked her to give this kind of commencement speech, in which she paraphrases from the university's own email to a crowd of rapt graduates.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: And this is my emphasis - normally, the college does not pay for commencement speakers. As you can imagine, being a state-funded institution, we have to be careful regarding the use of our resources. Well, I thought to myself, but I am a self-funded institution who needs to be careful regarding the use of my resources.

MALONE: So we were listening to this speech and thinking, yes, yes, this, this is our stuff - a comedian who's talking about money, who's - who seems to have their financial house in order here.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: As a Minnesotan, I am ashamed to admit that I love money. I love a fair exchange of goods and services, and I love full disclosure. And what better way to combine these passions than by telling you the story of how I got paid to be speaking to you today.

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

CHILDS: And I'm Mary Childs. Not only has Maria Bamford been telling the story of how she got paid for that commencement speech, she's been telling the story of how she got paid for kind of everything.

MALONE: Yeah, Maria Bamford has adopted this sort of radical financial transparency that is incredibly rare from famous people who presumably make lots of money. But she has arrived at this point after decades of hard-earned financial lessons.

CHILDS: So today on the show - those hard-earned financial lessons. Maria takes us inside her time at Debtors Anonymous and tells us the extremely practical steps she took to get herself out of debt and, of course, the backstory to her commencement speech paycheck. So last week, we sat down to talk to Maria Bamford.

MALONE: Now, have you done, at this point, a lot of business economics podcasts?

BAMFORD: No, no. I mean, I know nothing. I think it's a mystical science. But I - yeah, I love talking about personal finance, about open-book accounting. I love numbers.

CHILDS: And in case some of our audience are not fans of your work, is there a specific bit from some of your stand-up that you think really captures the Maria Bamford essence?

BAMFORD: Oh, my Christ. I'm going to say I don't know.

CHILDS: OK.

MALONE: Is it dealer's choice, then? You give us...

BAMFORD: Yes.

MALONE: ...Permission to find the right thing?

BAMFORD: Oh, my God, yeah. No.

MALONE: OK.

BAMFORD: Whatever the hell you want.

CHILDS: There is so much to choose from. She is famous for stand-up, where she's super honest and hilarious about her struggles with mental illness. But perhaps more relevant to this exact episode...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: All right, so I got an offer to do a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota...

MALONE: Yeah, Maria has a stand-up bit where she goes into even more backstory about the commencement speech and the negotiations leading up to it. So she recaps for her audience that she had been offered $0 by the University of Minnesota, which seemed too low.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: I went to my business advisor, who's my dear friend Jackie's 83-year-old father, Mr. Elliot Kashian. He's a former aluminum siding salesman currently living at the VA hospital in South Milwaukee, Wis. I said, Mr. Kashian, what do I do? He says, (impersonating Elliot Kashian) OK, you never say no without a number. That means if you're not even sure you want the job, put out something ridiculous, something you never gotten before in your life. That way, either you get a ton of money, or you don't have to do it.

(LAUGHTER)

MALONE: So Maria explains that she asked for 20 grand. And then here is where the university and Maria remember the story slightly differently. So the university says they replied with, is that $20,000 number negotiable?

CHILDS: Maria tells her crowd that the university came back to her with a counteroffer of 10 grand, which she then took back to her aluminum siding salesman business advisor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BAMFORD: Mr. Kashian said, (impersonating Elliot Kashian) OK, now you say, we'll split the difference - 15 - and then you settle for 12-5.

(LAUGHTER)

BAMFORD: But the guilt of the old country had done its work.

(LAUGHTER)

BAMFORD: And I went with 10, and then I ended up feeling so bad about myself that, as a part of the speech, I gave the money away to kids in the audience to pay down their student loans. Sounds like a nice thing to do. That is the only way I'm able to do kind things...

(LAUGHTER)

BAMFORD: ...If it is in public and it is grandiose.

(LAUGHTER)

MALONE: You know, when we at PLANET MONEY listen to comedy bits like this, or anything, we just can't help ourselves. We hear financial lessons in them, whether they are intended or not. And in this case, I hear negotiate. You can always negotiate. Channel your inner aluminum siding salesman.

CHILDS: Always be negotiating. So what we're going to do today is play for you our conversation with Maria - a conversation that is really a story - a story of her getting into debt early in her career, finding her way out of debt and eventually full-on succeeding at becoming this person on stage who talks about money so confidently.

MALONE: And along the way, we're going to PLANET MONEY. We're going to point out the money things that Maria did that sounded useful to us - after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Maria Bamford's debt story begins in the mid-1990s. Maria had just moved out to Los Angeles. She was struggling to make it as a stand-up comic. She got sick, unfortunately - went to a free clinic.

BAMFORD: So anyways, I got an antibiotic from them. I had an allergic reaction, which caused me to - it closes up your throat. You stop being able to breathe, and then your tongue sticks out or whatever - anyways.

MALONE: Wow.

BAMFORD: The ambulance came - anyway, so that was about five grand from various medical facilities. And, immediately, the collection agencies start calling. And, yeah, I just didn't have the money. I didn't have money for rent. And I know - I mean, I definitely had a parachute. I could've moved in with my parents, which they would've hated.

CHILDS: So this wasn't just five grand in medical debt. Maria says she was falling behind on rent because she had moved to LA and into an apartment that she kind of couldn't afford. Plus, the cost of living there was way higher than she was used to in Minnesota. Plus, she wasn't getting regular work, and the collectors are literally calling to demand their money.

MALONE: Do you know the amount of debt you're in at that point?

BAMFORD: Not really. Just 'cause I - you know, I was just really scared. I was just in a panic.

MALONE: But one thing to know about Maria Bamford, specifically, is that she loves a self-help group - any organized group of people voluntarily dedicated to improving their conditions.

CHILDS: Yeah. If you have a self-help group or a 12-step program, Maria will very likely join it. In fact, she just published a whole book basically about her love for these groups, called, "Sure, I'll Join Your Cult."

BAMFORD: The idea that you're sitting in a group making eye contact with people, and people are trying to make better decisions in life - I'm down for that, and I'm down for free. I'm down for free.

CHILDS: (Laughter).

BAMFORD: But, yeah, I've been to all the great - the hits. I've been to Sex and Love Addicts. I've been to AA, Al-Anon. I've been in OA - Overeaters Anonymous. And then I remember someone in my other 12-step program said, hey, want to try Debtors Anonymous? You don't have to be in debt to go, but I was in debt.

MALONE: Do you remember where that first meeting was?

BAMFORD: Yeah, it was in Koreatown. It was Olympic and - there was some church basement, yeah.

MALONE: Your classic church basement situation.

BAMFORD: Yes. Yes.

MALONE: So you're a connoisseur of these kinds of programs at this point. And so what's - what is different about Debtors Anonymous?

BAMFORD: Well, it's the same thing. It's very odd. It's very odd if you've never been to one. There's a lot of prayer. So that is the main turnoff for a lot of people. I was raised in the church. For some reason, it just kind of - the words kind of wash over me. But yeah, everybody goes around the room, says their name and identifies or doesn't identify or - you don't have to say your name. You can just say, I'm just here to visit or whatever. So I went to a meeting and immediately got some suggestions.

CHILDS: Now, Maria wants us to make it very clear she is not a spokesperson for Debtors Anonymous in any way. The following are things that she took away from the group. And actually, maybe while we're here, let's just also add that Kenny and I are not qualified or certified to give financial advice, so this is definitely not that. This is just what we took from Maria about what she took from her group.

BAMFORD: It's just very simple tools - so writing down numbers. You write down everything you spend, everything you earn. And that, I think, can be kind of just a calming thing. Also getting - so they have you write down all your debts. They say, you know, get clarity on who you owe, how much, and just write it down.

CHILDS: OK. So we're going to call this the second lesson that we hear in Maria's story. Find the simple things that can calm your financial nerves.

MALONE: The thing about personal finance is that, like, on paper, it is not particularly complicated, I suppose. Money coming in needs to equal or more than equal the money going out. But that stuff on paper we're talking about is your shelter and your food and your health care, and we, as a species, have not exactly evolved to be calm and thoughtful when basic needs are in peril. So yeah, writing things down is, as Maria says, basic, but also, it is not basic if writing things down helps you move away from the emotional parts of financial distress.

CHILDS: And you can take this technique further. So OK, you write everything down. You discover that you owe more money than you're making. How do you start to fix this? And here Maria had some help. Her Debtors Anonymous group had her create a little subgroup, what they call a pressure relief group, to help with granular advice and to provide accountability. The people in her pressure relief group - it was just two other people - went through her numbers with her. Like, hey, Maria, that unaffordable apartment - can we find something affordable?

BAMFORD: Immediately got some suggestions. They said, call everybody you know and people that you don't know in Los Angeles and see, can you - do they have a room for rent? You don't have any money right now, but you could pay them $50 a week. You know, like, call and ask verbally. Like, do it person to person and just put it out there.

MALONE: Now, eventually, a friend of a friend had a spare room and was OK with Maria doing a payment plan for the first few months. Great - lowering the amount of money going out the door.

CHILDS: The pressure relief group says, OK, let's also look at the money-coming-in part of this basic equation. That number needs to go up. At this point, Maria is a startup stand-up comedian, which is famously not very lucrative. So the group says, OK, until the big bucks arrive, how can you make money?

BAMFORD: Another thing, you know, Maria, sign up with - can you type? Oh, yeah, I can type. Sign up with five temp agencies. Call in every day at 7:30 a.m. and say, hi - I'm available to work. Hi - I'm available to work.

MALONE: Right.

BAMFORD: It's just like every recovery thing, like, a day at a time.

CHILDS: Also, the group helped her figure out ways to address the specific obstacles that were messing her up, like the friction of getting dressed in the morning for a job. So...

BAMFORD: Can you dress up - you know, be available dressed up for work? Sometimes I went to go sleep in my work clothes so that I would get up.

MALONE: So went to sleep in the clothes that...

BAMFORD: Yeah.

MALONE: ...You would wear to work if you ended up with a temp job.

BAMFORD: Yeah. Because I just - I was worried I wouldn't get up otherwise. So...

MALONE: Yeah.

BAMFORD: ...Do that. Like, things I just did not - are very elemental or whatever, but I still need to do them.

MALONE: I think of all the things Maria talked about, the pressure relief group is the one that I think about the most still - like, this idea of building a small group who is there for you to help you through the tiny little details of a hard situation and also just to laugh at how weird it can get and silly or, I don't know, whatever lesson we want to name that. That - like, that's lesson No. 3 that we hear in the story.

CHILDS: Yeah. It's like build your own emotional support advisory board.

MALONE: Yes, yes. Your own ESAB.

CHILDS: Yeah - an ESAB. And Maria's pressure relief group did have a piece of advice that's somewhat unconventional in the world of personal finance, specifically for someone like Maria who owed various parties a lot of money at the time.

BAMFORD: They said, do you have any money at all, and can you treat yourself to do something nice? So they suggested Disneyland, but I was like, boo. I think I must have gotten myself, I don't know, a diet cola out or something nice.

CHILDS: Yeah. She wasn't going to go ham, but she also took the advice that she still deserved some joy.

MALONE: Right - as opposed to the kind of personal finance advice that says - don't buy the Starbucks, live as frugally as possible and pay your creditors as quickly as possible. While Maria was making payments, just, you know, she was paying what she felt like she could do, not necessarily what her creditors were demanding.

BAMFORD: I think for me, although my credit was already terrible, so it didn't matter to me if I pay all my money to them first over every expense, like, over health care, over shelter - I move back in with my parents - over me going out or having meals or friendships - you know, good times - well, what that is going to mean is I'm going to have this very small life. And then all of a sudden, the debt's going to be paid off, and then I'm going to be like, oh, my God, I'm free - and then, you know, maybe go into debt again.

MALONE: So there's this idea that if you deal with the basic necessities of life, and you outlay enough money to do that in a sustainable way, and then pay off your debts using various techniques, you are building - you're building, like, a sustainable financial engine that can keep going even once your debts are paid off.

BAMFORD: Yeah, because it's not a financial engine. It's your life.

MALONE: Right.

BAMFORD: It's your life.

MALONE: Yeah, right.

BAMFORD: So I just think putting any ethical thing about, like - oh, you've got to pay back your creditors, you know, right away - is cruel.

CHILDS: So after a bunch of temp jobs, one of those jobs became a permanent job. And it took eight years, but eventually, Maria says, she paid off all that debt.

MALONE: And, you know, look, we have been doing our PLANET MONEY thing and imposing our own, like, sort of lessons on this story. But it does seem like Maria took her own one giant lesson away from this time getting out of debt, and that lesson is to be very open about money.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

CHILDS: So after the break, what happens when you decide to show everyone all of your accounting?

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

CHILDS: Maria Bamford is in a very different financial place than she was 28 years ago when she first went to Debtors Anonymous. She's had her whole own Netflix show. She's had big comedy specials. She's a big deal.

MALONE: How big of a deal? Well, you know, this is typically where I would Google a celebrity's name, and one of the first results would be net worth. And then there'd be a website with, like, some wild guess about the celebrity's net worth, but no. In Maria Bamford's case, just ask her. She'll tell you her net worth.

BAMFORD: Yes, $3.5 million.

CHILDS: It's gone up.

BAMFORD: 3.5 million.

MALONE: Oh, 3.5. It's got...

BAMFORD: Yes.

MALONE: Yeah. We read 3.1 or something.

BAMFORD: Yes, but due to the tulip-bulb nature of Los Angeles real estate...

CHILDS: Nice.

BAMFORD: ...This house is now somehow, despite the wasps filling the pool and the little rats running up and down the walls, worth $2 million (laughter).

MALONE: So yeah, Maria Bamford is doing well, but she is still in Debtors Anonymous. It's not just for people with debt. Maria still calls her Debtors Anonymous friends when she's thinking through money stuff. She has sponsees who talk to her about money stuff.

CHILDS: Which brings us to the kind of meta lesson for this whole episode - Maria's experiences have led her to become radically open about money. So for our final chapter, we just want to spend some time seeing what life is like when you're willing to tell anyone almost anything about your finances.

MALONE: Yeah, Maria has stated publicly that, you know, specifically, she's a big believer in something called open-book accounting. It's this buzzword in the accounting business world where you share key financial information to anybody that might have an interest.

CHILDS: In the business world, that might mean not just shareholders and employees but the public. And since Maria Bamford is her own business, Bamfooco, Inc., this generally means that she will share anything you want.

BAMFORD: I operate a business, you know? It is a business, and I have employees. And I want to treat people fairly so that at least people have the chance to say, hey, Maria, you're an a**hole.

(LAUGHTER)

BAMFORD: And I don't know. I'm relatively useless. I'm an older white woman who has had everything given to her and has - you know, have - has said everything - every platform, so might as well show people the books (laughter).

CHILDS: This is the final frontier.

MALONE: There is this pretty amazing chunk right in the middle of Maria's new memoir where she just publishes a month's worth of her business's accounting. And, you know, like, for just a second, let's just go through some of this.

CHILDS: Yeah. The finances for Bamfooco, Inc., from September 2022 - it says here Maria made $13,177.51 from voiceover work.

MALONE: Yeah, she made $40,418.75 total from live shows.

CHILDS: She somehow only made $97.96 on merch which is - really, that seems to be a great growth area.

MALONE: But the thing about being this open about your finances is it's not just your finances. You know, Maria hires people for things, and so their numbers are in here too and out in the world. So an acting coach named Ivana Shein (ph) - that's $400 Maria paid her.

CHILDS: Maria's publicist, Jess Guinivan - 1,650 for that month. And Maria says her publisher would not let her put more finances in the book because they thought it was boring. Just - that's just a wrong call, in my opinion.

MALONE: That is incorrect, Simon & Schuster.

CHILDS: Yeah.

MALONE: Sorry.

CHILDS: But, she says, if you come up to her on the street and ask her, she will just tell you, which, of course, we had to test.

MALONE: Well, so I just saw you at the Kennedy Center.

BAMFORD: Oh, right.

MALONE: You're - you will tell us how much you made for that show.

BAMFORD: For the - oh, for the show. I'd have to open my QuickBooks.

MALONE: Do you remember roughly?

BAMFORD: So my current rate seems to be - depending on where I am, like, right now, I do door deals. In California, it's very difficult to earn a lot, so - because there's so many comedians - so I'll get a guarantee of $1,000 versus 80% of the door. I'm doing one in Torrance this weekend. I'll probably - the gross will probably be around 3,500.

CHILDS: That $3,500 generally has to be shared with her opening act - which, very often, is her friend, comedian Jackie Kashian, who is also the daughter of Maria's aluminum siding salesman business advisor.

BAMFORD: And then I'll pay Jackie probably 1,500, and then I'll make 2,000. And then, if I go out of town, it's usually between 7- and 15,000 - gross, not net...

MALONE: OK.

CHILDS: That's...

MALONE: Oh, gross - right, right.

BAMFORD: Gross is the disgusting amount of money you're never going to get.

MALONE: Yes.

CHILDS: I'm curious how these - how all this radical transparency has affected your relationships, like with Jackie or with, you know, Jess, your publicist.

BAMFORD: Yeah.

CHILDS: But are they like, wow, thanks, man? Like...

BAMFORD: Yeah, I would - you'd - ask them. Please ask them.

CHILDS: OK, I'll call her - 'cause the idea of living as financially open as Maria sounds nice, but it certainly seems like it would come with some unintended consequences for the people around you. So yeah, we asked. I emailed Maria's publicist, Jess, who responded by sending us a quote from Maria's manager who said, quote, "Maria's team has always been completely transparent about their refusal to transparently comment on Maria's transparency."

MALONE: Yeah. In other words, there's no way they're going to weigh in on how they feel about their famous client's big transparency experiment, which, you know, fair enough. That is a good business decision, probably.

CHILDS: We also asked Maria's opener, Jackie Kashian, about this. What does it feel like to have your friend publish all your money stuff?

MALONE: Yeah. And, you know, Jackie told us that she's actually kind of used to it at this point. In fact, it has made her more open as well. So now she asks other comedians how much they get paid and tells them how much she is making. Here's Jackie.

JACKIE KASHIAN: Because there's no union. There's no HR. There's no anything in stand-up comedy. So we have to sort of have each other's backs in sort of a more guerilla fashion. And Maria's the best. She pays fair at the very least, and pays more than enough on the regular.

CHILDS: It's very great that Jackie feels like she's getting more than enough on the regular, but because the information is so public, everyone else gets to also have an opinion. And Maria says they do.

BAMFORD: I've had a few people say that I should pay my friend - after reading the book, I should pay my friend Jackie Kashian more per show. And so I'm thinking about that. I'm going to talk about her 'cause I - we did do profit sharing for a few years. And then I stopped doing that, and I don't know why. I think it was out of fear, greed, etc. It's not an attractive trait for sure, but somebody mentioned that. So I was like, yes, OK. Yes, you pay your friends the best. You pay your friends the best.

MALONE: You know, financial transparency is not, like, a new idea at all. In fact, we've done stories about companies that share salary information. But there is something about what Maria Bamford is doing that is different to me, I think, because she seems more like a financial transparency free spirit. She's moving through the world in this kind of enviable way. Like, she isn't ashamed if people know her business. She also knows whether or not she's getting ripped off 'cause she will apparently ask anyone what they're making. And it does seem really useful. And yet, I found it terrifying to try and imagine moving through the world like this sort of agent of open finance chaos.

CHILDS: And actually just to maybe illustrate that point a little bit, let's just finish with something that happened during our interview. So at the beginning, we're all getting set up. Kenny and I are recording in our own studios at our homes. Maria is in her home. We're talking to her through Zoom.

BAMFORD: But I don't know. Are you guys getting paid to do this podcast?

CHILDS: We are.

BAMFORD: Oh, my god. And let's ask Gemma.

MALONE: Gemma is our tape syncer. That's the person that we hired to go and hold a microphone to Maria so that we could get Maria's answers into a fancy recorder.

BAMFORD: How much are you getting paid?

GEMMA CASTRO, BYLINE: It's 250 for the first hour, and then each additional hour is $75.

BAMFORD: OK, 250 for the first hour, 75 additional for the next hours, which is odd 'cause you'd think it'd be 250 more for each additional hour. Are you paid for drive time and gas time in Los Angeles?

MALONE: Oh, dear.

CASTRO: I usually am - not this...

MALONE: Mary, Maria has just taken over financial negotiations.

CHILDS: Yeah.

BAMFORD: OK.

CHILDS: Is she our boss now?

MALONE: I don't know.

BAMFORD: Well, it's just interesting. It's just information. I want to get a bump for this beautiful young person who also is a musician. Now, Gemma, do you have a website?

CASTRO: I do, yes - gemmacastro.com.

BAMFORD: Gemmacastro.com - that's G-E-M-M-A-C-A-S-T-R-O. Yeah. So my only use as an older person, like if there's - I have enough money. I don't need any more money.

CHILDS: Maria has a new book out. It's called "Sure, I'll Join Your Cult." She also has a new comedy special out called "CROWD-PLEASER!".

MALONE: Maria did also tell us if there's a show that you want to go see that you can't get into, well, here we'll just let Maria say it.

BAMFORD: If you cannot afford a ticket, you can always email me at a ariamayamfordbay@gmail.com, and I will get you into a show for freezies (ph) plus one - unless it's terribly sold out, which is rare.

MALONE: Our show today was produced by Emma Peaslee. It was edited by Jess Jiang. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez and engineered by Neisha Heinis. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer. I'm Kenny Malone.

CHILDS: And I'm Mary Childs. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

Or maybe you saw her in in some Target commercials
I'll know there is no I in team
But there is an I in Christmas and at the Target two days
but for like the past five or six years we at planet money have been talking about Maria Bamford's work as a
Commencement speaker. Let us begin at the beginning
I will read a section of the email sent to me by the University quote in
2017 the University of Minnesota asked Maria Bamford to give their commencement speech
It is unclear though if they asked her to give this kind of commencement speech in which she
Paraphrases from the university's own email to a crowd of wrapped graduates and this is my emphasis
normally the college does not pay for commencement speakers as
You can imagine being a state funded
Institution we have to be careful regarding the use of our resources
Well, I thought to myself, but I am a self-funded
Institution who needs to be careful regarding the use of my resources
So we were listening to this speech and thinking yes
Yes
This this is our stuff a comedian who's talking about money who's who seems to have their their financial house in order here
I am ashamed to admit that I
love money I
love a fair exchange of goods and services and
I love full disclosure and
What better way to combine these passions?
Than by telling you the story of how I got paid to be speaking to you today
Hello and welcome to planet money. I'm Kenny Malone
And I'm Mary Childs not only has Maria Bamford been telling the story of how she got paid for that commencement speech
She's been telling the story of how she got paid for kind of everything
Yeah, Maria Bamford has adopted this sort of radical financial transparency. That is
Incredibly rare from famous people who presumably make lots of money
But she has arrived at this point after decades of hard-earned financial lessons
So today on the show those hard-earned financial lessons Maria takes us inside her time at
Debtors anonymous and tells us the extremely practical steps
She took to get herself out of debt and of course the backstory to her commencement speech paycheck
So last week we sat down to talk to Maria Bamford now
Have you done at this point a lot of business economics podcasts? No, no
I mean, I know nothing. I think it's a mystical science, but I I
Yeah, I love talking about personal finance about open book accounting. I love
Numbers and in case some of our audience are not fans of your work
Is there a specific bit from some of your stand-up that you think really captures the Maria Bamford essence? Oh my Christ
I
I'm going to say I don't know. Is it is it dealers choice then you give us permission to find the right thing?
Yeah, no, whatever whatever the hell you want. There is so much to choose from
She is famous for stand-up where she's super honest and hilarious about her struggles with mental illness
But perhaps more relevant to this exact episode
So I got an offer to do a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota
Yeah, Maria has a stand-up bit where she goes into even more backstory about the commencement speech and the
Negotiations leading up to it
So she recaps for her audience that she had been offered zero dollars by the University of Minnesota
Which seemed too low. I went to my business advisor. Who's my dear friend Jackie's 83 year old father. Mr. Elliott Cation
He's a former aluminum siding salesman currently living at the VA hospital in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin
I said mr. Cation. What do I do?
He says
Okay, you never say no without a number
That means if you're not even sure you want the job put out some ridiculous
So I mean never gotten before in your life that way either you get a ton of money, but you don't have to do it
So Maria explains that she asked for 20 grand and then here is where the university and Maria remembered the story slightly differently
So the university says they replied with is that
$20,000 number negotiable Maria tells her crowd that the university came back to her with a counter offer of 10 grand
Which she then took back to her aluminum siding salesman business advisor. Mr. Cation said okay
Now you say well split the difference 15 and then you settle for 12 5
But the guilt of the old country done its work
And I went with 10 and then I ended up feeling so bad about myself
That as a part of the speech I gave the money away to kids in the audience to pay down their student loans
Sounds like a nice thing to do
That is the only way I'm able to do kind things if it isn't public and it is
grandiose
You know when we had planet money listen to comedy bits like this or or anything
We just can't help ourselves. We hear financial lessons in them whether they are intended or not
And in this case I hear
Negotiate you can always negotiate
Channel your inner aluminum siding salesman
always be
Negotiating so what we're gonna do today is play for you our conversation with Maria a conversation
That is really a story a story of her getting into debt early in her career
Finding her way out of debt and eventually full-on succeeding and becoming this person on stage who talks about money so
confidently and along the way
We're gonna we're gonna planet money. We're gonna point out the money things that Maria did that sounded useful to us
after the break
support for this podcast and the following message come from wise the app that makes managing your money in different currencies easy with
Why's you can send and spend money internationally at the mid-market exchange rate?
No guesswork and no hidden fees learn more about how wise could work for you at wise calm
Maria Bamford's debt story begins in the mid 1990s Maria had just moved out to Los Angeles
She was struggling to make it as a stand-up comic. She got sick
Unfortunately went to a free clinic. So anyways, I got an antibiotic from them. I had an allergic reaction
which
Caused me to you. It closes up your throat
You stop being able to breathe and then your tongue sticks out or whatever. Anyways Wow
the
Ambulance came anyways, that was about five grand from various medical facilities and
Immediately the collection agencies start calling and
Yeah, I just didn't have the money. I didn't have money for rent and I know I mean I definitely had a parachute
I could have moved in with my parents, which they would have hated
So this wasn't just five grand in medical debt
Maria says she was falling behind on rent because she had moved to LA and into an apartment that she kind of couldn't afford
plus the cost of living there was way higher than she was used to in Minnesota plus she wasn't getting regular work and
The collectors are literally calling to demand their money. Do you know the amount of debt?
You're you're in at that point. Not not really just cuz I you know, I'm just really scared
I was just in a panic. But one thing to know about Maria Bamford specifically is that she loves a
Self-help group any organized group of people
Voluntarily dedicated to improving their conditions
Yeah
If you have a self-help group or a 12-step program Maria will very likely join it
In fact, she just published a whole book basically about her love for these groups called sure
I'll join your cult the idea that you're sitting in a group making eye contact with people and people are trying to make better
decisions in life
I'm down for that and I'm down for free
I'm down for free. But yeah, I've been to all the great the hits. I'm in the sex and love addicts
I've been to a a Alan on I've been in a way over years and I'm and then I remember
someone
My other 12-step program said hey trying to try debtors anonymous. You don't have to be in debt to go
But I was I was in debt. Do you remember where that first meeting was? Yeah, it was in Koreatown
It was an Olympic and there's some church basement. Yeah your classic church basement
Yes, so you're a connoisseur of these kinds of programs at this point and so what's what is different about debtors anonymous
Well, it's the same thing. It's very odd. It's very odd if you've never been to one. There's a lot of prayer
So that is the main turnoff for a lot of people
I was raised in the church for some reason it just kind of the words kind of wash over me
but yeah, everybody comes goes around the room says their name and
Identifies or doesn't identify or you don't have to say your name
you can just say I'm just here to visit or whatever, so I I
went to a meeting and
Immediately got some suggestions now Maria wants us to make it very clear
She is not a spokesperson for debtors anonymous in any way
the following are things that she took away from the group and
Actually, maybe while we're here
Let's just also add that Kenny and I are not qualified or certified to give financial advice
So this is definitely not that this is just what we took from Maria about what she took from her group
It's just very simple tools
So writing down numbers you write down everything you spend everything you earn and that I think it can be kind of just a
Calming thing also getting so they have you write down all your debts
They say you'll get clarity on who you owe how much and just write it down
Okay, so we're gonna call this the second lesson that we hear in Maria's story
Find the simple things that can calm your financial nerves
The thing about personal finance is that like on paper it is not particularly complicated
I suppose money coming in needs to equal or more than equal the money going out
But that stuff on paper we're talking about is your shelter and your food and your health care and
We as a species have not exactly evolved to be calm and thoughtful when basic needs are in peril
So yeah writing things down is as Maria says basic
But also it is not basic if writing things down helps you move away from the emotional parts of financial distress
And you can take this technique further
So, okay, you write everything down you discover that you owe more money than you're making
How do you start to fix this and here Maria had some help her debtors anonymous group had her create a little
Subgroup what they call a pressure relief group to help with granular advice and to provide
Accountability the people in her pressure relief group
It was just two other people went through her numbers with her like hey Maria that unaffordable apartment
Can we find something affordable immediately got some suggestions
They said call everybody, you know and people that you don't know in Los Angeles to see can you do they have a room for rent?
You don't have any money right now, but you could pay them
$50 a week, you know, like
Call and ask verbally like do it person to person and and just put it out there
Now eventually a friend of a friend had a spare room and and was okay with Maria doing a payment plan for the first few
Months great lowering the amount of money going out the door. The pressure relief group says, okay
Let's also look at the money coming in part of this basic equation. That number needs to go up at this point
Maria is a start-up stand-up comedian, which is famously not very lucrative. So the group says okay until the big bucks arrive
How can you make money another thing Maria sign up with can you type? Oh, yeah, I can type
Sign up with five temp agencies call in every day at 730 am and say hi. I'm available to work
Hi, I'm available to work. It's just like every recovery thing like a day at a time
Also, the group helped her figure out ways to address the specific obstacles that were messing her up
Like the friction of getting dressed in the morning for a job
So can you dress up you'll be available dressed up for work
Sometimes I went to go sleep in my in my work clothes so that I would get up
So went to sleep in the clothes that you would yeah, you would wear to work if you ended up with a temp job
Yeah, cuz I just I was worried. I wouldn't get up otherwise
So do that like things I just did not are very
Elemental or whatever but I still need to do that
I think of all the things Maria talked about the pressure relief group is the one
That I think about the most still like this idea of building a small group who is there for you
To help you through the tiny little details of a hard situation and also just to laugh at how weird it can get
And and silly or I don't know whatever lesson we want to name that that like that's lesson number three that we hear in
The story. Yeah, it's like build your own
Emotional support advisory board. Yes. Yes your own
ESAB yeah an ESAB and
Maria's pressure relief group did have a piece of advice. That's somewhat
Unconventional in the world of personal finance specifically for someone like Maria who owed various parties a lot of money at the time
They said do you have any money at all? And can you treat yourself to do something nice? So
They they suggested Disneyland, but I was like
I think I I think I must have gotten myself and I don't know what a diet cola out or something nice
Yeah, she wasn't gonna go ham
But she also took the advice that she still deserved some joy
Right as opposed to the kind of personal finance advice that says don't buy the Starbucks live as
Frugally as possible and pay your creditors as quickly as possible
Well, Maria was making payments just you know
She was paying what she felt like she could do not necessarily what her creditors were demanding
I think for me, although my credit was already terrible
So it didn't matter to me if I pay all my money to them first over every expense
Like over health care over shelter and move back in with my parents over
Me going out or having meals or friendships out, you know good times
Well, what that is gonna mean is I'm gonna have this very small life and then all of a sudden the debt's gonna be paid
off and then I'm gonna be like, oh my god, I'm free and
Then you may be going to debt again. So there's this this idea that if you deal with the
basic necessities of life and you and you outlay enough money to do that in a sustainable way and
Then pay off your debts using various techniques you you are building
You're building like a sustainable financial engine that can keep going even once your debts are paid off
Yeah, because it's not it's not a financial engine. It's your life
Right. It's your life. So I just think
putting any ethical thing about like oh you gotta pay back your creditors, you know right away is
Is cruel
so after a bunch of temp jobs one of those jobs became a permanent job and it took eight years but
Eventually Maria says she paid off all that debt and you know, look
We have been doing our planet money thing and imposing our own like sort of lessons on this story
But but it does seem like Maria took her own one giant lesson away
From this time getting out of debt and that lesson is to be very open about money
So after the break what happens when you decide to show everyone all of your accounting
Maria Bamford is in a very different financial place than she was 28 years ago when she first went to debtors anonymous
She's had her whole own Netflix show. She's had big comedy specials. She's a big deal
How big of a deal well
You know
This is typically where I would Google a celebrity's name and one of the first results would be net worth and then there'd be a website
It's like some wild guess about the celebrities net worth but no in Maria Bamford's case
Just ask her she'll tell you her net worth. Yes, three point five million dollars
Yeah, we read three point one or something yes, but due to the tulip bulb
Nature of Los Angeles real estate this house is now somehow
Despite the wasps filling the pool and and the little rats running up and down the walls
worth two million dollars
So yeah, Maria Bamford is doing well, but she is still in debtors anonymous
It's not just for people with debt Maria still calls her debtors anonymous friends when she's thinking through money stuff
She she has sponsees who talk to her about money stuff
Which brings us to the kind of meta lesson for this whole episode Maria's experiences have led her to become
Radically open about money. So for our final chapter
We just want to spend some time seeing what life is like when you're willing to tell anyone almost anything about your finances
Maria has stated publicly that specifically she's a big believer in something called open book accounting
It's this buzzword in the accounting business world where we share key financial information to anybody that might have an interest in the business
world that might mean not just shareholders and employees but the public and
Since Maria Bamford is her own business Bamfouco, Inc
This generally means that she will share anything you want. I operate a business, you know
it is a business and I
Have employees and I want to treat people fairly so that at least people have the chance to say hey
Maria, you're an asshole
And
And I don't know. I
I'm relatively useless
I'm an older white woman who has had everything given to her and has you know
Have has said everything every platform so might as well
Show show people the books
There he's this pretty amazing chunk right in the middle of Maria's new memoir where she just
Publishes a month's worth of her businesses accounting and you know, like for just a second. Let's let's just go through some of this
Yeah, the finances for Bamfouco, Inc from September 2022. It says here Maria made
$13,177 and 51 cents from voiceover work. Yeah, she made
$40,418 and 75 cents total from live shows
She somehow only made
$97.96 on merch which is really that seems to be a great growth area
But but the thing about being this open about your finances is it's not just your finances
You know Maria hires people for things and so their numbers are in here too and out in the world
So an acting coach named Ivana Sheen, that's $400 Maria paid her
Maria's publicist Jess Ginevin
1650 for that month and Maria says her publisher would not let her put more finances in the book because they thought it was boring
Just that's just a wrong call and that is incorrect Simon Schuster
Sorry, but she says if you come up to her on the street and ask her she will just tell you which of course
We had to test well
So I just saw you at the Kennedy all right
You're you will tell us how much you you made for that show for the oh for the show
I'd have to open my QuickBooks
Do you remember roughly so my current rate seems to be?
Depending on where I am like right now. I do door deals in California
It's very difficult to earn a lot. So because there's so many comedians
So I'll get a guarantee of a thousand dollars versus 80% of the door
I'm doing one in Torrance this weekend
I'll probably the gross will probably be around
3500 that 3500 dollars generally has to be shared with her opening act which very often is her friend comedian
Jackie Cation who is also the daughter of Maria's aluminum siding salesman business advisor, and then I'll pay
Jackie probably
1500 and then I'll make
2000 and then if I go out of town, it's usually between 7 and 15 thousand a gross not
Gross is the disgusting amount of money you're never gonna get yes
I'm curious how these how all this radical transparency has affected your relationships
Like with Jackie or with you know, just your publicist, but are they like wow, thanks, man
Like yeah, um, I would you'd ask them
Please ask them because the idea of living as financially open as Maria sounds nice
But it certainly seems like it would come with some unintended consequences for the people around you
So yeah, we asked I emailed Maria's publicist Jess who responded by sending us a quote from Maria's manager
Who said quote Maria's team has always been completely transparent about their refusal to
Transparently comment on Maria's transparency
Yeah, in other words, there's no way they're gonna weigh in on how they feel about their famous clients big
Transparency experiment which you know, fair enough. That is a good business decision probably we also asked Maria's opener Jackie Cation about this
What does it feel like to have your friend publish all your money stuff?
Yeah, you know Jackie told us that she's actually kind of used to it at this point
In fact, it has made her more open as well
So now she asks other comedians how much they get paid and tells them how much she's making
Here's Jackie because there's no union. There's no HR. There's no
Anything in stand-up comedy. So we have to sort of have each other's backs in
sort of a more guerrilla fashion and
Maria's the best
She pays fair at the very least and pays more than enough on the regular
It's very great that Jackie feels like she's getting more than enough on the regular
But because the information is so public
Everyone else gets to also have an opinion and Maria says they do I've had a few people say
That I should pay my friend after reading the book
I should pay my friend Jackie Cation more per show and so I'm thinking about that
I'm gonna talk about her because I
We did do profit sharing for a few years and then I stopped doing that and I don't know why I think it was out
of fear
Greed etc. It's not an attractive trait for sure
But somebody mentioned that sounds like yes. Okay. Yes, you pay your friends the best you pay your friends the best
You know financial transparency. It's not like a new idea at all
In fact, we've done stories about companies that share salary information
But there is something about what Maria Bamford is doing that is different to me
I think because she seems more like a financial
Transparency free spirit. She's moving through the world in this kind of enviable way
Like she isn't ashamed if people know her business
She she also knows whether or not she's getting ripped off cuz she will apparently ask anyone what they're making
and it does seem really useful and
Yet I found it terrifying to try and imagine moving through the world like this sort of
agent of open finance
Chaos and actually just to maybe illustrate that point a little bit
Let's just finish with something that happened during our interview. So at the beginning we're all getting set up
Kenny and I are recording in our own studios at our homes. Maria is in her home
We're talking to her through zoom for but I don't know. Are you guys getting paid to do this podcast?
Oh my god, and let's ask Hema Hema is is our tape sinker
That's that's the person that we hired to
Go and hold a microphone to Maria so that we could get Maria's answers into a fancy recorder
How much how much are you getting paid?
It's 250 for the first hour and then each additional hour is
Okay 250 for the first hour 75 additional for the next hours
Which is odd because you'd think it'd be 250 more for each additional hour
Are you paid for drive time and gas time in Los Angeles? Oh dear
Mary Maria has just taken over financial negotiations. Is she our boss now?
I don't know. Well, it's just interesting. It's just information
I want to get a bump for this with a beautiful young person who also is a musician at no
How about you have a website?
HemaCastro.com that's G-E-M-M-A-C-A-S-T-R-O
Yeah, so
My only use as an older person. I have enough money. I don't I don't need any more money
Maria has a new book out. It's called sure. I'll join your cult
she also has a new comedy special out called crowd pleaser Maria did also tell us if
There's a show that you want to go see that you can't get into
Well here, we'll just let Maria say it if you cannot afford a ticket
You can always email me at a Ria Mae Amphibay at gmail.com a Ria Mae Amphibay gmail.com
And I will get you into a show
for freezies plus one
Unless it's terribly sold out which is rare
