It's Groundhog Day, and once again, the eyes of the nation have turned to a small town in Western Pennsylvania. Every February 2nd, the only story anyone can talk about is whether or not Punxsutawney Phil will see his own shadow. If he does: six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't: spring is on its way.

It's Groundhog Day, and once again, the eyes of the nation have turned to a small town in Western Pennsylvania. Every February 2nd, the only story anyone can talk about is whether or not Punxsutawney Phil will see his own shadow. If he does: six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't: spring is on its way.

This year, in a cruel twist of fate reminiscent of the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, two Planet Money hosts have found themselves facing a curse. They'll be trapped in this never-ending groundhog news cycle until they can find a new February 2nd story to tell...something that has nothing to do with one furry prognosticator... something that changed the economy forever.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your little hand in mine. There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb.

AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: OK, campers, rise and shine. And don't forget your booties 'cause it's cold out there today.

It's cold out there every day. What is this, Miami Beach?

Well, not hardly. But the big question on everybody's lips...

Their chapped lips.

On their chapped lips. That's right. Do you think Phil will come out and see his shadow?

Yep. As people gather for a ritual of studied absurdity, our furry forecaster prepares to tell us whether we're in for six more weeks of winter. In...

PLANET MONEY. PLANET MONEY.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

Wait, Erika, do you - is the radio talking to us?

ERIKA BERAS, HOST:

It is. Is that Ailsa Chang?

CHANG: Yep.

MALONE: All Things Considered host?

CHANG: 'Tis I. Listen here. You have to save us because we are stuck in a news loop. Every February 2, we cover this groundhog, and no one remembers anything else from that day.

MALONE: Oh, that is - yeah, that is true.

BERAS: Yeah. I don't think I could tell you a single nongroundhog thing that's ever happened on February 2.

MALONE: Yeah, no. Phil sort of sucks the air out of the whole news cycle, doesn't he?

CHANG: I know. This is our curse. And you know what? Now it is your curse, PLANET MONEY, because we are stuck in this news cycle until you can find the perfect Groundhog Day story.

MALONE: Oh, like the movie "Groundhog Day." That's what we're doing? Where the guy wakes up in the same day over and over until he can break the mysterious curse.

CHANG: Yes. Yes. Yes. Exactly. And you know what? The only way to break this curse is for PLANET MONEY to find the perfect Groundhog Day story - something that has nothing to do with actual groundhogs, something that happened on some February 2, something that, like, changed the economy forever.

BERAS: Oh, no problem. We can bang this out right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF KEYBOARD CLACKING)

MALONE: ...Slash-wiki-slash-February 2 - and badaboom (ph).

BERAS: Look who was born on Groundhog Day 1905. Happy birthday, Ayn Rand.

MALONE: So easy. So easy. Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone.

BERAS: I'm Erika Beras. And perhaps no birth has reverberated through the economy more than Ayn Rand.

MALONE: Author of controversial but influential texts.

BERAS: Muse, a former Fed chair, Alan Green...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your little hand...

MALONE: Uh-oh.

CHANG: I guess it looks like the Groundhog gods think there are plenty of Ayn Rand stories already.

MALONE: That is probably fair.

CHANG: I mean, listen; they're picky. And to be honest, I don't know exactly what they want. So sorry, I guess throw some more stories at the wall. And good luck.

(SOUNDBITE OF PAUL MICHAEL HARRIS, SIMON BATES AND DAVID KELLY'S "BARNEY'S BAGELS")

BERAS: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Erika Beras.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone. And today on the show - well, I guess - yeah. I guess that's what we're going to figure out here.

BERAS: Yeah. What important economic story happened on some February 2 in history? Any February 2.

MALONE: How hard could this be? We have thousands of years of February 2s. Surely our future selves won't regret signing up for this bizarre challenge, Erika.

BERAS: Sure...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your little hand...

MALONE: All right. All right.

BERAS: We get it.

MALONE: We get it.

BERAS: OK. Our mission - find a story about something that changed the economy forever, something that occurred on some February 2, any February 2 through history.

MALONE: We began our search with us.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: First, the news and Diane Dimond...

MALONE: The old NPR archives - February 2 from decades ago, so much groundhog coverage.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: ...According to the furry forecaster...

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: ...Since 1887, every February 2...

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: ...Weather-predicting groundhog...

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: ...Punxsutawney Phil, the Pennsylvania groundhog...

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing) ...Critter in his burrow of dreams, and he said, oh, springtime, is that you calling me?

BERAS: Of course, we had a groundhog song.

MALONE: On brand. Delightful. Not helpful, though, with the mission to find some nongroundhog Groundhog Day story. And so our team started Googling frantically. And then we met up with what we found.

Can we clap?

(SOUNDBITE OF CLAP)

BERAS: Close-ish.

MALONE: All right. How's everybody doing? Has everybody - we've been doing nothing but researching for, like, three straight hours.

BERAS: Turns out our team had dredged up some interesting things.

MALONE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. February 2, 1709 - the real-life Robinson Crusoe was rescued from the real-life desert island or whatever.

BERAS: On February 2, 1876, baseball's National League was formed.

MALONE: PLANET MONEY producer Dave Blanchard told us that he'd been digging into local newspaper archives and discovered that, in 1952, there was a Groundhog Day heist in which a Chicago magician named Eddie Kotz (ph) was the victim of a very specific kind of magical robbery.

DAVE BLANCHARD, BYLINE: The list of thieved goods includes one rabbit, five opossums, one raccoon, two ferrets, three guinea pigs, 50 white rats and 25 homing pigeons.

BERAS: What?

MALONE: What? Were there possums in magic shows?

BERAS: That seems risky.

BLANCHARD: There were also four skunks, which the thieves did not steal, apparently, which was a wise decision.

MALONE: I mean, hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. Today on the show, the black market for stolen magic possum?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your little hand...

MALONE: OK. You know, that's fair. It's as if, Erika, the groundhog gods know when we don't have enough material to keep stretching out a story.

BERAS: Very convenient.

MALONE: Yes, yes. And maybe the gods want something more obscure than just Google results. After all, the best PLANET MONEY episodes, they're a little deeper cut than just top-line Google.

BERAS: And then we thought, you know what's full of little-known stories from specific dates? Diaries.

MALONE: Diaries.

BERAS: What about diaries from important historical figures?

MALONE: And it wasn't long before we came across an article from Smithsonian magazine titled "John Quincy Adams Kept A Diary And Didn't Skimp On The Details."

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE TONE RINGING)

BERAS: We needed the nonskimped details.

SARA MARTIN: Good afternoon. Adams Papers at the Massachusetts Historical Society - this is Sara.

MALONE: Hey, Sara. This is Kenny Malone from NPR's PLANET MONEY. We have a bit of a strange request for you if you're game.

MARTIN: Sure.

BERAS: We asked Sara Martin if she could flip to some February 2 entries.

MALONE: What's the Quince (ph) up to?

MARTIN: Well...

MALONE: Could we call him the Quince? I don't - what's the nickname?

(LAUGHTER)

MARTIN: Well, we use acronyms, so we call him J.Q.A.

MALONE: All right, J.Q.A is good, too.

MARTIN: But the first one I can find - written on February 2, 1782. This is during the American Revolution. And so they are trying to win recognition from Russia. So a 14-year-old John Quincy Adams is at St. Petersburg serving as a secretary and interpreter on what became a failed diplomatic mission.

BERAS: And that's what this young boy is journaling about? That's amazing.

MALONE: Fourteen?

MARTIN: He was 14 years old.

MALONE: Pretty good. Pretty good. But I don't know. Like, what would the PLANET MONEY angle be here? I'm not...

BERAS: I don't know. Like, secret history of child labor during the Revolutionary War? Maybe? I don't know?

MALONE: I'm going to go with not really an economic story. But what about diaries from some of our most famous economists? Like, what were they up to on February 2?

BERAS: Adam Smith - couldn't find any diaries.

MALONE: Nah. Milton Friedman? Couldn't find much there.

BERAS: But then, there was David Ricardo, 1800s advocate for free trade, famous for classical theory of comparative advantage.

HUMBERTO BARRETO: But the other thing he did that people don't know about is that he just wrote an incredible number of letters. So his correspondence is unreal.

BERAS: This is Humberto Barreto. He is an economics professor who knows a lot about David Ricardo. And Humberto says he did find a letter dated February 2, 1822.

MALONE: And so we leaned in. What was it? What incredible economic insight was running through one of our greatest economic minds on that cold London Saturday?

BARRETO: Ricardo did write a letter complaining about a portrait that he had done of him, which has now become the image that everyone knows.

MALONE: Oh, no.

BARRETO: If you know Ricardo, you've seen this image.

MALONE: Oh, no.

BARRETO: If you don't know Ricardo, of course, you haven't.

BERAS: Yes. Ricardo was just complaining about a portrait.

MALONE: Yeah, although not the quality. The problem appeared to be that he didn't have the portrait yet.

BARRETO: I can read you the exact sentence if you wish.

MALONE: Yeah.

BERAS: We need to hear this sentence.

BARRETO: He said, it is nearly two years since it was painted, and I have never yet seen it at my own house.

MALONE: I mean...

BERAS: Today on the show, the technological breakthroughs that brought the price of portraits down and democratize the selfie?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your...

MALONE: Oh, the fickle, capricious groundhog gods.

BERAS: Yep.

MALONE: What are you going to do?

BERAS: Truth be told, it was harder than we expected to find something that happened on February 2 that changed the economy forever. We started grasping at straws a little bit.

MALONE: Yeah, we were like - I don't know - February 2s on the New York Stock Exchange?

(SOUNDBITE OF NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE OPENING BELL)

MALONE: Oh, look at that. There was a February 2016 opening bell rung by Ms. Piggy.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ERIC JACOBSON: (As Ms. Piggy) Bears, bulls - who needs them, Wall Street? You've got moi.

MALONE: Unfortunately, that was on February 1.

BERAS: Oh, bummer.

MALONE: So that we can't do.

BERAS: Then, we were like, OK, the Ayn Rand birthday story was a no. But look who else was born on February 2 - Shakira.

MALONE: You cannot argue with the economic impact of this.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "HIPS DON'T LIE")

SHAKIRA: (Singing) I'm on tonight. You know my hips don't lie, and I'm starting to feel it's right.

MALONE: Unfortunately, we also could not argue our way into a Shakira interview. So then, we called the next person on the Wikipedia birthday list who seemed like might actually take our phone call.

ADAM CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. My name is Adam Christopher. I am an author. I don't know what to say. I've never done this kind of thing before.

BERAS: So, Adam - he's a New Zealand-born sci-fi writer.

MALONE: I hope you don't mind that you are a backup plan to Shakira, who was also born on February 2.

BERAS: Yeah.

CHRISTOPHER: Yes, my birthday buddy. Every year, I wish her happy birthday on Twitter. She's never responded.

BERAS: This might be the year.

CHRISTOPHER: This will be it. This is it.

BERAS: Yeah.

CHRISTOPHER: She's going to say it.

MALONE: Anyway, yeah. Adam did get his first book deal on his birthday, which - technically, an economic event that happened on...

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I'VE GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then put your...

MALONE: OK. Yeah, all right. That's fair. But look, it was not easy to find something. And when we thought all hope was lost...

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY ET. AL'S "DON'T LOOK DOWN")

MALONE: ...We saw it. It was a tiny thing - administrative paperwork, really - from February 2, 1897, that, I believe, we could argue changed the world forever.

BERAS: And made it more delicious - after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY ET. AL'S "DON'T LOOK DOWN")

MALONE: Our Groundhog Day quest had led us to one story and one place.

GALEN MOORER SR: Today, we've got butter pecan. We've got golden vanilla. We've got Fruity Pebbles cheesecake.

BERAS: Yes, an ice cream shop - Happy Day Dessert Factory in Pittsburgh. This is Galen Moorer Sr. His son, the junior, owns the shop. Galen Sr. manages it.

MOORER: We've got funfetti.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Uh-huh.

MOORER: We've got banana cream pie.

MALONE: And we are here because 126 Groundhog Days ago to the day, the U.S. issued a patent to an inventor who lived mere miles from this ice cream shop.

BERAS: His invention - the ice cream mold and disher, also known as one of the very first ice cream scoops.

MALONE: Which we explain to Galen Moorer.

MOORER: Oh, wow. I'm not even - I didn't know that at all.

BERAS: Well, why do you think you've never heard about him before?

MOORER: That's a good question. (Laughter) I don't want to use the words inconsequential. But something that's in such regular use as an ice cream scooper, you don't ever think of as, hey, where did this originate from? Where did it come from? It's such a simple, but yet necessary, invention.

BERAS: Simple, yet necessary, invention?

MALONE: I like it.

BERAS: Let's give it a try. Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Erika Beras.

MALONE: And I'm Kenny Malone. Today on the show, how the humble ice cream mold and disher maybe arguably changed the world forever. Yeah? Not cut off yet. Let's do it.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL MAY AND MARC FERRARI'S "KEEP THE WHISKEY FLOWIN'")

BERAS: The year is 1896. Alfred Cralle is a 30-year-old Black man born in Virginia the year after the Civil War. He migrates to Pittsburgh, starts working as a porter at a drugstore in a hotel. The hotel serves ice cream, and Alfred notices that the way they serve the ice cream seems annoying, messy.

MALONE: Yeah, yeah. People were apparently taking, like, two spoons, normal spoons, and jamming one end of the ice cream and scraping it off with the other spoon. I mean, caveman behavior, Alfred probably thought.

BERAS: And so Alfred designed a scoopy-looking thing with a mechanical handle. When you squeeze the handle, it activates a kind of scraper that ejects the ice cream out of the scoop.

MALONE: It was the first ice cream scoop.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL MAY AND MARC FERRARI'S "KEEP THE WHISKEY FLOWIN'")

MALONE: OK, caveat here. Many places claim that this is the first, but there do seem to be at least one or two other patents before this one. But, like, one of those still required a spoon to empty out the scoop. The other one's closer, but maybe a little less elegant. So we're going to argue Alfred's was probably maybe the first truly modern scooper. Whatever. Don't worry too much about it. Let's keep going.

(SOUNDBITE OF DANIEL MAY AND MARC FERRARI'S "KEEP THE WHISKEY FLOWIN'")

BERAS: Alfred Cralle's patent was approved on February 2, 1897 - Groundhog Day.

ADAM MOSSOFF: Hi, Erika.

BERAS: Hi there. Can you hear me?

MOSSOFF: I can hear you fine. Can you hear me?

BERAS: I can.

MALONE: Adam Mossoff - law professor at George Mason University, patent expert, and knows a lot about how patents get turned into actual, you know, money.

MOSSOFF: You know, patents are property rights, and they, like all property rights, might lead to great success or may not.

MALONE: Property rights. And Adam gave us this comparison that I find really useful. He said, you know, a patent is just an idea sketched out and then legally tied to the inventor. And that really is kind of like somebody who say, you know, just owns a piece of vacant land.

BERAS: Yeah. Adam says vacant land isn't inherently a business. Its owner would have to figure out what to do with it.

MOSSOFF: They can sit and wait for the land to grow in value. They can lease it out and become a landlord. They can build a factory on it. They can build an office building on it. They can build a home. And then, they can sell that home.

MALONE: And if you think about the patent version of this - let's say you get a patent for an ice cream scoop - you still have to figure out how to turn that into a business.

BERAS: You could manufacture the thing yourself and sell it.

MALONE: You could lease your patent to a manufacturer.

BERAS: You could full-on sell your patent.

MALONE: Which brings us back to ice cream mold and disher inventor, Alfred Cralle. Now, reportedly, within days of getting his patent, Alfred had received letters from firms in Chicago, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, quote, "offering large inducements to him should he wish to sell his patent outright or on a royalty."

BERAS: But that's basically where our knowledge ends. It's unclear if he ended up selling the patent, if he made lots of money, no money. We really just don't know for sure.

MALONE: What we do know for sure is that the idea of the ice cream scoop freaking rules, Erika.

BERAS: Yes, it does. And as patent expert Adam Mossoff agreed, it is definitely an upgrade over a pair of spoons.

MOSSOFF: Yes.

MALONE: Is it possible to overstate the productivity gains derived from the invention of the ice cream scoop?

MOSSOFF: I don't believe it's possible to overstate it because this is the key part of all great innovations - right? - is that they contribute - right? - to these little efficiencies in our life.

BERAS: And these little efficiencies in the economy.

MALONE: Back at the Pittsburgh ice cream shop, it was time to figure out just how much the humble ice cream scoop changed the economy forever. And we had devised a little experiment for shop manager Galen Moorer the senior.

BERAS: Would you say you're the best scooper who works here? Your son's not here, so you can say...

MOORER: (Laughter).

BERAS: You can tell us the truth.

MOORER: I would say I'm the most efficient.

MALONE: Which is perfect because efficiency is what we are here to test - specifically labor productivity, which is a technical economic term meaning, you know, output per worker. And the factors of this - they are, of course, things like the worker's skills, you know, management practices and technological change. That's what we need to test - the technological change that is Galen's ice cream scoop.

MOORER: (Laughter) OK.

BERAS: OK. Well, I have some tools with me.

MOORER: OK.

BERAS: I brought a tool that Galen will have to use for our experiment. From my back pocket, I pull out what someone serving up ice cream might have used before the scooper was invented - a spoon, a tablespoon from my kitchen.

MOORER: (Laughter) I did not realize the spoon was going to be a party (ph).

BERAS: Oh, the spoon is a big part of this. OK.

MOORER: I already know how sloppy this is going to be, so I'm going to actually wear gloves.

MALONE: Gloves? That's five extra seconds. These spoons are already cutting into productivity.

BERAS: Now, with his modern scoop, Galen can make 11 scoops of ice cream in 30 seconds. By the way, the scoop has advanced since that earlier version. The newer ones don't need that scoop ejector piece?

MALONE: No, but look, any scoop is going to be faster than the old spoons. But to calculate our productivity gains, we do need to know how much faster they are.

BERAS: And so we stand in front of the hardest ice cream to scoop - butter pecan. Galen skeptically holds my kitchen spoon, and I start a 30-second timer.

Three, two, one, go. Scooping. One. That's two.

MOORER: ...When I'm doing this 'cause I can feel the spoon bending already.

BERAS: The spoon may not make it.

MOORER: (Laughter).

BERAS: In 30 seconds of spooning, I guess we'll call it, Galen makes five passable-looking ice cream balls of butter pecan. My kitchen spoon does not survive.

MOORER: The spoon is dead.

BERAS: The spoon is dead (laughter)?

MALONE: Now, five spoon scoops is not even half as much as Galen can do with a real ice cream scoop. That is an incredible increase in labor productivity that surely Galen's business benefits from.

BERAS: Could you imagine running this business without the ice cream scooper?

MOORER: Well, if my only alternative was a spoon, I seriously doubt that anybody would be in the ice cream business. No, I cannot imagine running this business without the ice cream scooper. You'd need more people because it'd be virtually impossible to keep up with the demand.

BERAS: Impossible to keep up with demand. Kenny, it seems pretty clear to me that we have made the case that the ice cream mold and disher changed the economy forever.

MALONE: Couldn't agree more, Erika. And if only there were one last person we could call to confirm whether or not the ice cream scoop is, say - I don't know - one of the maybe top 50 inventions that shaped the modern economy.

TIM HARFORD: Of course. I am the author of "50 Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy" and a whole bunch of other things.

BERAS: This is friend of the show Tim Harford.

HARFORD: Yeah.

MALONE: Well, Tim, we've got the book here. And, you know, I see the plow.

BERAS: Yep.

MALONE: Yeah.

BERAS: I see plastics in here.

MALONE: I see a light bulb. Am I missing ice cream scooper?

HARFORD: Well, I really love the humble inventions that people overlook - the pencil, the brick...

MALONE: Yeah.

HARFORD: ...Paper. Paper. Nobody gives - everyone talks about the printing press. Nobody gives paper enough credit.

MALONE: Oh.

HARFORD: But, yeah, you missed ice cream scoop because it's not there.

BERAS: Yeah. Tim's not buying this.

MALONE: No.

BERAS: There are economy-changing inventions. And some of the economists that study this stuff, they call those inventions general purpose technologies.

MALONE: Yeah. And those technologies tend to have three main characteristics. No. 1, they work their way into lots of nooks and crannies of the economy.

BERAS: No. 2, they themselves can easily be improved upon.

MALONE: Yeah. And then, No. 3, those inventions also improve other parts of the economy.

BERAS: And we tell Tim, look, ice cream scoops are everywhere. They've definitely been improved upon. And they make the food economy better.

HARFORD: I mean, don't get me wrong. That's good. And if I wanted to scoop ice cream, I'd be happier if I had an ice cream scoop than if I was just working with a regular spoon. But I'm not sure I'm going to call this a general purpose technology. I mean, it's not really everywhere in the way that - say, that nuts and bolts are everywhere.

MALONE: Oh, like, literal nuts and bolts.

HARFORD: Yeah, like, literal nuts and bolts. Or the wheel or...

MALONE: That's not a - wheel feels like a high bar.

BERAS: Yeah.

HARFORD: Or hinges. Or ball bearings is another one.

MALONE: It's a pretty good one.

HARFORD: There are all kinds of places where you don't expect them. Whereas ice cream scoops - where are they? - they're pretty much exactly where you expect them. They're kind of in spoon drawers and ice cream stores, and that's about it.

MALONE: OK. But, Tim?

HARFORD: Yeah.

MALONE: Imagine a hot Pittsburgh day...

HARFORD: Yeah.

MALONE: ...Line out of the ice cream door. If the ice cream scoop lets you serve twice as many customers, which then theoretically helps the ice cream shop make more money, which then theoretically allows the shop to charge us less per scoop - if the ice cream scoop theoretically gives us more and cheaper ice cream, tell us how this is not the 51st invention that shaped the modern economy.

HARFORD: Well, I mean, everything you've said is true. It's not exactly the light bulb, is it? Because, like, the...

MALONE: Oh, looks like we lost him there. Probably just a bad connection. I'm sure what he was going to say is the ice cream scoop's not the light bulb, but the ice cream scoop is really important because without it, would we have nearly as many standalone ice cream parlors? I think not.

BERAS: And so...

(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID HOFFNER'S "OLYMPIC FANFARE")

BERAS: ...In conclusion, in the aftermath of the Civil War, in the midst of the full-fledged Industrial Revolution as the gears of innovation shifted, what is possibly one of the greatest inventions ever received its patent on Groundhog Day 1897.

MALONE: The ice cream mold and disher, invented by Alfred Cralle, tells us so much about patents, about labor productivity, about, dare I say, who we are as human beings. And Groundhog Day after Groundhog Day, the ice cream scoop has made our lives so much sweeter.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "I'VE GOT YOU BABE")

SONNY AND CHER: (Singing) Then, put your...

MALONE: Oh, come on.

CHANG: Oh, thanks for trying, PLANET MONEY. I think you're going to have to do this again next year. And I guess I'm going to have to read this again. Here we go. (Reading) That's right, woodchuck chuckers. It's Groundhog Day. Get up, and check that hog. Come here, groundhog. This weather....

MALONE: Oh. Sorry, Ailsa. Let's do the credits, Erika.

(SOUNDBITE OF DAVID ROTHSCHILD ET AL.'S "CHANCE ON ME")

MALONE: Do you listeners happen to know any weird, hidden stories that happened on a Groundhog Day that also happen to have even a vague economic angle that we can spin? Well, we're definitely going to need a lot of those for next year. Our future selves would love it if you'd email those ideas over to planetmoney@npr.org. That's planetmoney@npr.org.

BERAS: Today's show was produced by Dave Blanchard and edited by Sally Helm. It was engineered by Robert Rodriguez and Gilly Moon and fact-checked by Sierra Juarez. PLANET MONEY's acting executive producer is Jess Jiang. Special thanks to Dennis Tucker (ph), Heidi Wastweet (ph) and James Trout (ph).

MALONE: Tim Harford's podcast is called "Cautionary Tales." I will not vouch for any ice cream scoop opinions he has on that show. That's all I'm saying.

BERAS: I'm Erika Beras.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
And welcome to Planet Money Summer School,
our sun-filled and hopefully fun-filled journey
into the heart of the economy.
I'm Stacey Vanek-Smith,
and this season is all about macroeconomics,
which deals with the economies of whole countries.
And macroeconomics was born to answer one question.
How do we tame the business cycle?
Because make no mistake,
the business cycle is a beast.
The ups and downs of the economy,
the boom and bust cycle, it is ruthless.
It can wipe out thousands of businesses,
millions of jobs, life savings inside of a week.
And here to walk us into the belly of the business cycle
is special guest Atif Mian,
a professor of economics at Princeton
and author of House of Debt,
a book about the origins and consequences
of the 2008 housing crash.
Welcome, Atif.
Thanks, it's great to be here.
So Atif, your book deals with one of the most dramatic
and definitely destructive recent examples
of a business cycle bust.
And in it, you make the point
that this big macroeconomic thing, a recession,
it is made up of a lot of smaller human stories,
individual decisions and consequences,
small business going bankrupt or a home foreclosure,
things like that.
I think economics is not supposed
to be a quote unquote dry subject like that.
It's really about human beings.
It's really about how we connect with each other.
So it's a very social science, right?
Right, and today we are hearing two very human stories
about how deeply the business cycle
can affect companies and individuals
and also how the business cycle
affects inequality in the US.
And that is also a focus of your work.
So I grew up, I was raised in Pakistan
and I had no idea what economics was.
You know, the schooling system there and so on.
Economics is not really taught.
I thought a lot about problems though.
A lot of poverty around me
and that really sort of moved me in many ways.
And I thought, you know, I'll build stuff
to kind of solve some of those problems.
So let's meet the beast, the business cycle.
So economists talk about a business cycle
as having four parts.
There's the expansion, the peak,
the recession, and the trough.
And one of the most sort of interesting features
of the cycle is that the expansions
tend to be long and gradual
and the recessions tend to be fast and sharp.
But before we get into that,
I wanna talk about this word cycle, business cycle.
Cause that makes it sound like natural,
like sort of a natural occurring thing like the seasons.
Is the business cycle, is it natural?
So a business cycle is natural
in the sense that it's the result of those,
some of the very sort of natural forces
of how the economy is connected
and what people's expectations are.
So in that sense, it's very natural.
But at the same time,
that doesn't mean that it's always inevitable.
Well, maybe not inevitable,
but definitely hard to thwart, right?
I mean, there have just been huge efforts made
by many brilliant people for many decades
to try to avoid the business cycle
or at least to sort of soften the boom and the bus.
And sometimes you'll hear these called
counter cyclical policies.
You'll hear this term thrown around.
And those are policies that basically
just counteract the business cycle.
Things like raising taxes during a boom
or giving out money during a bust.
Things that kind of try to go against
where the business cycle is.
And after a quick break,
we are gonna hear two stories
about some of the counter cyclical systems
that the US has put in place
to try to soften what can really be just
the crushing impact of the business cycle
on individuals and on companies.

Hello, class.
It is time to jump into the economics
of the business cycle and take a look
at one of the inventions the US has adopted
as a way to save businesses
that might get crushed under the wheel
of the business cycle.
Some economists actually say
this is the secret superpower of the US economy,
bankruptcy.
We're gonna hear a piece
that I reported with Sonari Glinton back in 2015.
It is the story of a small business
in Charlotte, North Carolina
that got caught up in the housing bust of 2008.
Hi, Roddy Player here
with Queen City Audio, Video, and Appliances.
You won't wanna miss our blockbuster Labor Day sale.
This is the very persuasive voice of Roddy Player.
He is the CEO of Queen City Appliances.
It's a family business that Roddy really grew up in.
I was sweeping the floors when I was eight years old
and working on the delivery trucks
when I was 12 or 13 years old.
And as soon as you graduate high school,
you can get on the sales floor.
So that summer I was on the sales floor.
When Roddy's father passed away, Roddy became CEO.
And for years, business boomed.
Charlotte was growing,
homes were going up all over the place,
and all of those new homes, of course,
needed stoves and refrigerators.
Roddy started to expand his business
all the way up to 17 stores.
Then 2009, you see where this is headed,
the housing bubble burst.
No new homes, no one was buying refrigerators,
dishwashers, mattresses at the time.
Sales kept dropping and dropping and dropping.
I don't want to be called the eternal optimist,
but I always felt it just couldn't get any worse
and it couldn't get any worse
and it couldn't get any worse.
And well, it did get worse.
The math just didn't add up anymore.
The money from sales just wasn't enough to pay the bills.
He was going to have to do the thing
that had been deep in the back of his mind
for a while.
The thing that any small business is trying to avoid,
especially a family business, bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy is a grueling process.
There are a lot of steps.
The first thing you have to do is call a lawyer.
And then you have to sign all of these papers
with any of the other owners of the business.
In this case, that was Roddy's mother,
Frances Player, who was 83 years old at the time.
And they went to the office together
and filled out the paperwork.
They filed for bankruptcy.
And that moment when you file for bankruptcy,
everything changes.
I hadn't actually appreciated this,
but when you file for bankruptcy,
it's public and all the details of your failure
are also made public.
It's there in the court papers for anyone to read.
How much you owe, who you owe,
it's all out there for anyone to see.
And just minutes after Roddy and his mom
filed the documents,
the Charlotte Observer published a short story online.
Roddy's phone started ringing off the hook.
His son, who was away at college, also saw the news.
He knew things were difficult for us,
but I think the actual filing hit the public airwaves
and he sent me a text, simple note, you okay?
Roddy was not okay.
In fact, even now, when he talks about the bankruptcy,
his whole demeanor changes.
He looks down, he starts fiddling with things,
he gets quieter.
He told me that day that he filed for bankruptcy
was one of the worst days of his life.
Your friends, your neighbors,
it's difficult to walk around town
when you've got something like that hanging over your head.
Roddy's mom, Frances, had an especially hard time with this.
She had helped start this business 60 years before.
She still worked there four days a week
in accounts receivable.
And for her, bankruptcy was just not something you did.
I really did struggle with it,
lost a lot of sleep over.
Not easy to get up and go to church that Sunday morning.
It really wasn't after it came out in the newspaper.
This was a terrible moment for Roddy and his family.
And in most countries,
this would have been the end of the story.
The banks and his creditors would have come in
and repossessed the ranges, the TV sets.
Everything would have shut down
and all the pieces of the business
would have been sold off and that would have been it.
But in the United States, there is another path.
Chapter 11, as in chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
And it is a way for companies
that can't pay their bills to not die, to keep going.
And the idea predates appliance stores by a lot, actually.
It goes back to the railroads.
And we learned this from historian David Skeel.
That was unprecedented in world history.
No other country had had a system like this
that was designed not to shut down substantial businesses
when they failed, but to reorganize them,
to give them another chance, in a sense.
So what did the world think of this new kind of bankruptcy?
Well, they thought we were crazy, as they often do.
You can kind of see their point.
If you set up a system where when companies
sort of screw up and you forgive a bunch of debt
and you let them keep going,
then you might end up creating this whole environment
where businesses just do crazy, risky things.
You could end up encouraging the kind of thing
you really want to avoid.
Here in America, we came down on the side
of allowing bankrupt companies to have a second chance.
And when Roddy Player filed for bankruptcy,
that's what he decided he wanted,
to try and keep going.
When you file for bankruptcy,
it's like hitting a big pause button.
All the people you owe money to,
for a moment, you don't have to pay them.
But you do have to make a list for the court
of everyone you owe money to, everyone.
Roddy's list was 133 pages long.
He showed it to me.
General Electric Company's on here for $556,000.
Here's a freight company, AAA Cooper.
We owed $865,000 too.
In all, Roddy was millions of dollars in debt.
For Queen City Appliance to stay alive,
Roddy was going to have to convince
General Electric and Whirlpool and the banks,
he owed a bunch of money to banks,
that they would be better off
if they allowed him to keep his doors open.
Roddy was going to have to put forward
a specific plan and it would be painful with cuts.
In court, there would be an actual vote
where all the people he owed money
would decide yes or no.
Should Roddy and Queen City Appliance
be given a second chance?
If they voted yes,
then Roddy would actually have to make it work,
meet specific earnings targets.
And along the way, every little decision
he was going to make had to be okayed
by Whirlpool and GE and everyone he owed money to.
Every decision Roddy made needed court approval.
He had to get approval to pay his electricity bill.
He had to get a special approved loan to do that.
He even had to get approval
to put gas in the delivery trucks.
Roddy start to draw up that plan to submit to court
and explain how he was going to fix the business.
He hired a turnaround expert
who looked through his books and was very blunt.
You wanna make it out of bankruptcy?
You wanna be profitable again?
You're gonna have to close some of your 17 stores.
I still have nightmares about that
because we had to eliminate a lot of jobs
and you're sitting across the table from somebody
telling them that you're gonna have to let them go.
It really hurts you and it scars you to be honest with you
and still to this day think about those type things.
How many stores do you have now?
We've got four stores or so.
17 stores to four stores is a lot fewer.
But it's a lot more than zero
which would have been the alternative.
Roddy had to lay off 130 employees
but 75 still got to stay with him.
So Roddy filed his plan
for how he was gonna fix the company.
All of his creditors, the people he owed money to,
GE, the banks, the electric company, they all voted.
And they said, okay, we'll give this a shot.
Roddy ran his four remaining stores
as efficiently as he could,
trying to cut costs at every possible turn
and also trying to sell as many stoves
and refrigerators as he possibly could.
Every week he had to submit a progress report
to the court to show how much money was going out
and how much money was going in.
Queen City Appliances was in bankruptcy
for a year and a half.
But on August 27th, 2013, it was over.
Roddy got an official document from the court
saying his company was no longer in bankruptcy.
Actually, he was waiting for it for a few days.
Took a few extra days and I thought it was.
Were you checking your email like every two seconds?
Sure, sure.
And calling, looking for it and all kinds of stuff.
But that was the highlight of the process.
It is like the shortest legal document I have ever read.
There's this big official-looking court seal
in one corner and there's just one sentence.
It says, the Chapter 11 case
of the above-named debtor is closed.
Roddy threw a party for his staff.
He showed them a documentary
about Captain Ernest Shackleton
and his crew surviving winter in the South Pole.
He handed out Queen City Strong bracelets.
He still wears his every day.
And that was that.
Queen City was back.
We will be back after a short break
with the rest of Roddy's story
and, of course, some economic lessons.
Hey, Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi here.
We get a lot of questions from listeners.
Recently, one of you asked us to confirm,
is there a secret underground economy
in the lawless frontier town of Waterbury, Vermont
trafficking in Ben and Jerry's ice cream?
It's delicious.
It's easy to barter.
People want it.
It's fantastic being able to use the pints
instead of cash money.

Quintity Appliances has been out of bankruptcy
for two years now,
and Roddy says the company's doing really well.
Profits are way up.
He took me to the back of one of his stores
into the warehouse.
So, can you show me around some of the appliances?
I'd love to, love to.
During the bankruptcy,
Roddy tells me it was almost empty back here.
Now, there are huge boxes stacked to the ceiling.
So, dishwasher's five high,
laundry products are four high,
row after row of appliances
that just makes you feel good.
Looking back on this though,
Roddy doesn't exactly see bankruptcy
as one of America's greatest inventions.
He seems to see it as a huge pain.
His mom though,
who at first thought bankruptcy
was not a thing that good solid people did,
has turned around.
She's actually kind of a fan of it.
I think it's a very, very good way
for a company to continue.
So, your mind was changed about bankruptcy?
Yes, it really was.
It would have broken my heart if we'd closed.
And around town,
Frances says people were surprisingly accepting
of the whole thing.
They didn't see it as a failure
or them as a failure.
Like that first Sunday morning
after they filed for bankruptcy,
and she was so nervous about going to church.
All of our friends,
everybody was very supportive.
So you went to church and it was okay?
It was okay.
It was.
Same seat.
Same seat for how many years?
In the U.S.,
we've decided we want an economy
where the CEO of an appliance store
can dream big,
expand really fast.
And if it doesn't work out,
we have a system for dealing with the mess
so the business can keep going.
So buy local and save more at Queen City
where you'll always find the right product,
right price and real answers guaranteed.
Hey class,
we're back to talk business cycle
with economist Atif Mian.
So Atif, chapter 11 bankruptcy,
this is something that businesses use all the time,
of course,
but particularly in moments of economic downturn,
where for instance,
Roddy Player saw business just kind of dry up overnight
because of where the business cycle was.
What role do you see bankruptcy playing
in the business cycle in this story?
Well, the very first thing is that bankruptcy
is this example of the helping hand
that government is providing, right?
Because you could have taken the position and said,
well, let the markets handle it,
in which case the creditors would have taken
whatever they could
and everyone would lose their jobs
and all the 17 stores as the story mentions
would have closed down.
So think about that for a minute.
If they had been forced into complete liquidation
and forced to close down,
imagine what else we would have lost.
A business is not just a bunch of assets.
A business also has a number of relationships
that they develop,
relationships with customers,
relationships with suppliers
and those relationships are very important
to keep a healthy economy going.
One thing I've heard as a counter to that
is that if you do give a helping hand,
it can actually potentially exacerbate things.
I remember very clearly
in the very beginning of the housing crisis,
a lot of people were talking about,
well, people should have known better.
They shouldn't have taken out loans
that they couldn't afford.
I mean, Roddy, you could argue,
shouldn't have expanded as quickly as he did,
shouldn't have opened up as many businesses.
And if you take away the consequences of that,
it might create a situation
where people take too many risks
and that can make economic booms really dangerous.
I mean, people don't feel
like they're gonna be consequences.
So they get careless.
So they spend more money.
So the economy starts to overheat
and economic bubbles can happen.
Yeah, it's a dominant argument.
I hear this a lot.
We can try to act tough in this moment of trouble
and we can say, no, if you borrowed $100,
you must pay back each and every penny
of those $100 back.
We can try and do that,
but we will end up all of us being worse off.
Why?
Because those people are not making
that much money anymore.
Some of them are laid off.
Some of them, they don't have that much revenue
through their businesses, as in Queen City's example.
So when you force them
to pay back the entire 100,
what they're going to do is they're going to cut back
on their spending even further.
And so the economy will contract further.
Right, I mean, this was an argument
that economist John Maynard Keynes used
to encourage things like government spending
during economic downturns
to kind of keep people buying things,
keep money flowing through the economy.
We heard about this, of course,
in the very first episode of Summer School this season.
We also heard an argument
from economist Friedrich von Hayek,
who said, no, no, no,
what we need to focus on isn't how to react to the bust.
A lot of it is what happens during the boom,
the expansion portion of the business cycle.
He says, when things start growing too fast
and money starts kind of flying around,
the economy can overheat.
And Hayek made the point
that this part of the business cycle
could cause real distortions in the economy
and regular people could get caught up
in the crosshairs of this
and find themselves in some pretty harrowing situations
and we'll hear one of those stories after the break.
The business cycle.
It can be devastating for companies,
but also for individuals.
And trying to get help to companies
and especially to individuals during a bust,
that can actually be very, very tricky to do.
We're gonna play a story
that was reported by Adam Davidson
and Alex Bloomberg back in 2009.
And in this story,
they're checking in with a man
who got one of those shady loans
that banks were sort of handing out by the thousands
during the housing bubble.
I met this one guy, Richard.
He's a Marine.
He's this big guy, over six feet tall.
And when he came back from Iraq a few years ago,
he bought one of these fancy new mortgages
with an adjustable rate.
Recently, his rate reset.
It's gone up by more than $2,000 a month
and he's fallen behind on his payments.
It got to the point where,
one point, my son had $7,000 in a CD
and I had to break it.
And I mean, that really hurt
because I was saving that money for his college.
I mean, I put $2,000 back,
but it's like you can't have a future.
They put you in a situation
where after a while, you're gonna fail.
So that was May 2008.
Obviously, a lot happened since then.
And in the course of that first hour,
we learned that Richard had gotten a shady mortgage
and that his broker had lied.
Though Richard would have qualified
for a low fixed rate mortgage,
his broker put him in this higher,
sort of really lousy adjustable rate mortgage
because we think his broker
was able to make a bigger commission.
And the broker lied on the application
saying Richard made $195,000,
even though Richard only made $37,000 a year at the time.
Right, he was dealing with a group called NACA,
the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America.
And at that point in spring of 2008,
things weren't looking very good for him.
But then when we actually talked to him this week,
he had some good news to report.
With the help of NACA, the payments were cut in half.
So it's very manageable now.
Richard went from paying nearly $6,000 a month
to just under three grand.
But it was not easy.
It wasn't like someone just handed him this freebie
without any hard work.
It was a fight.
It was a real fight.
It took most of the last year and a half
to get to this good situation.
The problem was that Richard,
and this was typical of a lot of people we talked to,
he bought his house not with one mortgage,
but with two mortgages.
NACA was able eventually to solve the problems
with the first mortgage,
but the second mortgage NACA could not help him on.
And so this last year and a half for Richard
has been a lot of fighting with one or both
of his mortgage servicing companies.
He's been waiting on hold.
He's been getting transferred to different supervisors.
He says he got within a couple of days
of actually getting foreclosed on.
All that waiting and wondering
and just not knowing what his future holds,
it's been really stressful for him.
Your body just goes through weird things.
I didn't know stress was so powerful.
Your body goes through a lot.
Wait, wait, wait.
You fought in Iraq as a Marine
and this was more stressful?
Yeah, believe it or not.
Yeah, it was.
It's a lot harder to deal with
than shooting at people
and having people shoot back at you.
And believe it or not.
It's actually, it's hard to believe.
Would you, I mean, having come back from Iraq,
you would, I mean, I'm sure you would have thought,
well, that was the most stressful thing
I'll ever do, right?
Yeah, I definitely thought, like, you know,
once I could beat that, I could beat anything.
But, you know, it's a different type of feeling,
you know, because they train you for combat
in the military.
Nobody trains you for this type of stress.
No one.
In this situation, I felt totally alone.
Like I had no one to turn to.
And for Richard, it was particularly bad
because he's basically the sole breadwinner
for his whole family.
And he was thinking that if he'd lose his house,
then his mother and his sick brother
would have to move back to public housing.
And he'd have to give up on this dream that he has
to be the first person in his family
to really actually own something valuable,
to build wealth for future generations.
When you hear people talk about, you know,
their family and the money that they have now,
it's always the, you know, what their great-grandfather,
what their grandfather did.
And, you know, in my life, on my life's work,
I just want to be the grandfather,
the great-grandfather that set the foundation
for my son and my son's sons and go on
so my generation can actually change.
So, you know, taking my mother out of the ghetto
and putting her into something that she can call her own
and we can build something on was, you know,
anyone's dream, but especially mine.
So Richard's saving grace, it turns out,
was one of those local morning shows,
Good Day New York.
I've actually never seen it.
I guess I should watch it more often.
Yeah, exactly.
They were talking over the details
of President Obama's mortgage relief plan
and Richard was watching this and saying,
hey, wait a second, they're talking about me.
I fit all those criteria.
I have a mortgage I can't afford,
but I do have a history of trying to pay it,
just not being able to,
largely because of a ridiculously high interest rate.
And so even though he qualified, though,
it took months to figure out how this plan works
and then to convince his mortgage company
to actually lower his rate.
But then, very recently, he got a phone call
from a guy at his mortgage company named Peter.
He said, Mr. Campbell, we have good news.
You know, we're able to modify your loan
and these are the terms
and he started telling me the terms
and tears started coming to my eyes
when he said, we're gonna go from 11 and a quarter
down to 3% and then I said, is it fixed
or will it still balloon?
He said, there's no balloon.
It'll be fixed for the life of the loan.
You pay this mortgage for 30 years.
The house is yours.
Like, when I talk about it now,
I still get that warm and fuzzy.
What'd you do?
Did you call your fiance or how'd you handle it?
Oh yeah, I ran around the living room
and then I went and I grabbed her and I picked her up
and she was like, what's going on?
And then I told her and then we started jumping up and down.
It was a beautiful feeling, beautiful feeling.
Okay, that was Adam Davidson
and Alex Bloomberg back in 2009.
I am here in 2022 with economist Atif Mian.
What are your reactions to the story of Richard?
It's a great story.
I mean, isn't it?
I mean, you can see in practice
the value of easing the debt burden
in collective times of trouble.
And again, it's not Richard's fault
that the whole world is collapsing around him.
Or that his mortgage lender lied about his income.
Exactly, exactly.
And there were hundreds of thousands,
in fact, millions of such stories.
And the one thing I kept thinking
as I was listening to Richard's story
was for every Richard,
there's also like a Nancy or a Bob
who did not get what he got,
which was a modification of his mortgage.
So in fact, over four million homeowners
were forced into foreclosure
and hence they lost their homes.
Four million were forced into foreclosure.
Many more suffered than needed to.
One of the things that really strikes me in this story
is just how hard Richard was working
to try to build wealth.
You know, he bought the CD for his son
to go to college.
He was buying a home.
I mean, that really struck me.
Oh, that's right.
I mean, you know, the phrase that stuck to me
is when Richard says they put you in a situation.
Like who's they?
What is he talking about, right?
But you can see that
he's talking about something very real.
Right, they put you in this situation.
I mean, to me, this is really speaking
to this idea of economic inequality
and trying to change your economic situation
and sort of feeling like you're doing
everything you're supposed to do.
And it's just not possible.
Like there is a system that is working against you,
the they.
I know, Atif, that you have done a lot of work
on economic inequality.
And economic inequality in the US
was really improving a lot for decades and decades,
but it has started to become worse.
Inequality has been rising in recent years.
What is going on?
Why is this happening?
The key change that has happened in our economy
since the 1980s, which is this rising inequality,
these greater pools of money available
for people to borrow and lend,
that ends up raising the value of this house
that Richard is trying to buy.
And so while his income is not rising as much,
his aspiration of buying that starter home
becomes more and more out of reach.
If you look at a 35-year-old
making kind of median average wage,
if you took that individual or that couple perhaps in 1980
and you said, okay, what's the home ownership rate?
What's the likelihood that they would be able
to own a house?
And now you looked at the same 35-year-old couple
earning average median income,
and you said, okay, what is the likelihood
that today in 2020 they can afford the same house?
There is like a night and day difference.
Today, it is much more difficult,
as much as 10 to 20% less likely
that they will be able to own a home.
This is how much more difficult it has become
for the average, literally speaking, person or household
to buy their first house.
So there is something deeper that has happened
in the economy that is creating that kind of feeling
of unease that Richard talks about when he says,
they put you in a situation that is not good.
I mean, you can almost think of business cycles
as a symptom of this broader underlying disease
that we face.
Okay, we are getting to the end of class.
Time to talk about some of the concepts
and vocabulary that we've learned about today.
Remember, there is a test
at the end of Planet Money Summer School,
and you can earn your very own real-life diploma.
Not sure you can actually or should use it
to try to get a job, but it is real.
You can put it on your wall.
So some of the concepts that we have learned,
first of all, the business cycle.
Those are just the ups and downs of the economy.
And the business cycle has four parts.
Economists think of it in four parts.
There's the expansion, the peak,
the recession, and the trough.
A recession, by the way, bonus word,
is generally considered to be six straight months
of the economy getting smaller, of the economy shrinking.
Another word, countercyclical.
This is a policy or a plan
that tries to counteract the business cycle,
that kind of goes against
where the business cycle is at that moment.

let us know what that moment was.
