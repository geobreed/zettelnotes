Economist Tatyana Deryugina.

There seems to be headlines about floods, wildfires, or hurricanes every week. Scientists say this might be the new normal — that climate change is making natural disasters more and more common.

Tatyana Deryugina is a leading expert on the economics of natural disasters — how we respond to them, how they affect the economy, and how they change our lives. And back when Tatyana first started researching natural disasters she realized that there's a lot we don't know about their long-term economic consequences. Especially about how individuals and communities recover.

Trying to understand those questions of how we respond to natural disasters is a big part of Tatyana's research. And her research has some surprising implications for how we should be responding to natural disasters.

JEFF GUO, HOST:

The other day, I got a chance to talk to someone who really changed how I think about economics and economic research.

I kind of want to just ask you, do you remember me?

TATYANA DERYUGINA: No (laughter). You mean have we met before?

GUO: Tatyana Deryugina is an economist and a professor at the University of Illinois.

Yeah.

DERYUGINA: OK. I'm sorry, I do not. I have a terrible...

GUO: You have no recollection whatsoever?

DERYUGINA: No.

GUO: (Laughter) That's amazing.

DERYUGINA: I'm so sorry.

GUO: Before she was a professor, Tatyana was a teaching assistant. In fact, she was the teaching assistant for a class that I took in college.

DERYUGINA: Oh, wow (laughter). I'm sorry, I don't remember you, but that's so cool.

GUO: Tatyana did not remember me at all, but I remembered her because the point of that class was to teach us how to write an economics research paper. And the thing I learned from Tatyana was that being an economist is hard. You want to answer all these big important questions, but you need data. And even more than that, you ideally want something random that happens to one group of people, but not another. Economists call this a natural experiment.

I remember you telling us about the project that you were working on, which was about hurricanes. And we were thinking, oh, yeah, like, hurricanes, terrible things. But what a perfect subject of an economics paper because hurricanes are random. They're kind of like these great natural experiments. Like, that's very interesting.

DERYUGINA: Yes, that's - from an economist standpoint, that is...

GUO: (Laughter).

DERYUGINA: A great feature of a hurricane is the unpredictability of it, the fact that people do not see it coming.

GUO: Yes, that is an extremely economist-y viewpoint. But studying hurricanes was just the start for Tatyana. Over the past decade, Tatyana has made an entire career out of studying natural disasters. And her research, well, these days, it's become really, really important.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: Hello and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jeff Guo. It feels like every week, we see another headline about a record-breaking earthquake, wildfire or a hurricane. Scientists say this might be the new normal, that climate change is going to make the weather weirder and wilder and deadlier, which is why today on the show, I wanted to talk to Tatyana, because she's become this leading expert on the economics of natural disasters, how we respond to them, how they affect the economy, and also how they completely change our lives. That research project that Tatyana started about hurricanes, it led to this surprising, almost unbelievable conclusion. And it completely altered how I see the world.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: Way back when Tatyana started researching natural disasters, she realized there's actually a lot we don't know about their long-term economic consequences. Like, yeah, there are macroeconomic studies about, like, what happens to a country's GDP after a disaster. But we know a lot less about how individuals, how communities recover from these things. Trying to understand those questions - how we respond to natural disasters, how we should be responding to natural disasters - that is a big part of Tatyana's research. So to start off our conversation, we talked about the different ways our society handles disaster relief from insurance to federal aid, to charity. For instance, one of Tatyana's recent studies looked at tornadoes to try to answer this simple question about charitable donations that for a long time we didn't actually know the answer to.

DERYUGINA: Yeah, so in that study, we are trying to understand whether charitable giving in the aftermath of a disaster comes at the expense of other causes, because whether we see this extra charitable giving as a good thing kind of depends on where it's coming from in people's budgets.

GUO: Oh, yeah, because it's like, it's a good thing if it's, like, coming out of the junk food budget, but maybe less of a good thing if it's coming out of the, like, money I was going to give to orphans budget.

DERYUGINA: Exactly, exactly.

GUO: And what did you find?

DERYUGINA: Well, we found that total giving went up in the aftermath of a tornado.

GUO: The charity budget got bigger in a tornado year?

DERYUGINA: Yeah, exactly. The charity budget got bigger. And we also find some evidence that it got bigger persistently. Like, if you look at giving, you know, the next year, it remains slightly elevated.

GUO: How interesting.

DERYUGINA: So it expanded not just in that year but in subsequent years as well.

GUO: It made people more charitable?

DERYUGINA: Yes.

GUO: Why do you think that is so?

DERYUGINA: The cynical explanation is that they got on Red Cross' mailing list and started getting lots of texts...

GUO: (Laughter).

DERYUGINA: ...And phone calls from the Red Cross (laughter). But the less cynical explanation is, you know, it feels good to give. And so maybe people realized, hey, I don't miss that junk food that I would have bought.

GUO: Yeah.

DERYUGINA: I really like feeling like I was able to help a human being in need. And they continue to give more because of that experience.

GUO: Yeah, yeah. I definitely buy that argument. But in the grand scheme of things, is this kind of individual charitable giving, is that a big part of how people in America recover from natural disasters?

DERYUGINA: No. For most people it's going to come from hopefully their insurance policy that they had as well as from the government.

GUO: It feels like if climate change is going to make these natural disasters more and more common, does the way that we have to do insurance also have to change?

DERYUGINA: Absolutely. So the insurance market is in a huge turmoil right now because they're realizing that the risks are going up, and so premiums have to go up. But they're running into a lot of resistance.

GUO: Well, you hear in Florida - right? - like, all these insurers that are saying, well, we're - you know, we can't deal with this market anymore. We're going to pull out. We don't really want to offer insurance in Florida anymore.

DERYUGINA: Yes. And you see a similar thing happening with California and wildfire insurance. Partly it happens because there is limits on what premium increases they can put in. And so they're saying, well, if we can't do these premium increases, then we're not going to be in this market at all.

GUO: Oh, so what you're saying is, like, the government won't let them raise the price of insurance enough to make the insurance work?

DERYUGINA: In some cases, yes.

GUO: Oh, because I see how that makes sense. Like, you don't want insurers to price gouge.

DERYUGINA: Exactly. Yeah, I think it's a market that needs some regulation, but it's a very complicated market to regulate.

GUO: Yeah. And it kind of feels like, you know, insurance prices, they're almost this tool - right? - through which, you know, you influence people to take seriously the consequences of climate change, of, you know, more natural disasters, more flooding, more wildfires, more all of these things to make that decision not just, you know, abstract and what the scientists are saying, but, like, a literal cost - a price of the kind of risk that they're going to be living through.

DERYUGINA: Yes, exactly. And that is why it can be a very useful tool. I think where we can do better is communicating to people that this isn't just price gouging. This actually reflects our best guess as to the risk that you're facing. And I think a lot of people probably have a hard time believing that because disasters are very rare things, and so there's almost, like, this sense of - it can't happen to me. This is an outrageous price. Nothing's happened, you know, in the last 20 years. Therefore, it's not going to happen.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: Coming up, we talk about a paper of Tatyana's that totally surprised me, totally changed how I see the world. It was about Hurricane Katrina.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GUO: So I want to talk about this one paper of yours. And I remember reading it a couple years back, and when I read it, I was, like, totally blown away. Like, it was so, so surprising - the thing that you found. And this was a paper about Hurricane Katrina. And I think it really changed how I think about not just natural disasters, but I think this was a paper that kind of revealed something deeper about society and about how we choose to live our lives. And I'm excited to talk to you about it.

DERYUGINA: Yeah, I'm excited to tell you about it. So when it came to studying Hurricane Katrina in my fourth year of grad school, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago, and I spent quite a bit of time talking to Steve Levitt. And at one point we...

GUO: The "Freakonomics" guy.

DERYUGINA: Yes, yes (laughter). So at one point we were discussing Hurricane Katrina and wondering what happened to the victims in the long run. Did they recover back to where they were? Were they permanently scarred by this hurricane? And I thought, OK, maybe actually, this is a question we can answer.

GUO: Yeah. So what were you expecting to find?

DERYUGINA: So I thought that we would find persistent long-term declines in income. Given how bad the hurricane was, how many people were involuntarily displaced...

GUO: Yeah.

DERYUGINA: ...I thought that not only we'd find kind of a sharp decline in income in the short run, but it would persist for years.

GUO: Like, it would scar their careers and sort of their lives and their financial situation.

DERYUGINA: Exactly. Exactly.

GUO: Yeah. But it's still useful to know - right? - just to be able to quantify how bad it is. And it's very surprising to me that we didn't actually know the answer to this, like, you know, five years, 10 years down the road question.

DERYUGINA: Yeah. And I think, you know, when you know what we had to do to get that answer, it's perhaps less surprising because...

GUO: (Laughter).

DERYUGINA: ...We ended up teaming up with an economist who was working at the U.S. Treasury and had access to individual tax records. And that's how we were able to identify people who were living in New Orleans before the hurricane and then track them through their tax records regardless of where they moved to afterwards. So you do need very specialized, hard-to-access data to do these kinds of studies.

GUO: Well, because that tax data, like, they keep that locked up, right? It's very hard to get access to that.

DERYUGINA: Oh, yes. I never touched the data myself.

GUO: Oh, my gosh. They wouldn't let you?

DERYUGINA: No, no. Yeah, Laura Kawano, our co-author at U.S. Treasury at that time, she was the one that did all the data work. So it's very well-protected.

GUO: So you were able to get all this data on all these people who had been living in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina. And you were able to follow them for, like, you know, almost a decade after the hurricane hit. And you compared them to other people who lived in similar places just to get a sense of what their life might have been like if the hurricane hadn't happened. And...

DERYUGINA: Exactly.

GUO: And when you made that comparison, when you got all the data together and you crunched everything, what did you find?

DERYUGINA: Well, we found that in 2005 and 2006, people from New Orleans were doing noticeably worse.

GUO: OK. So it's like, immediately after the hurricane, like, people are not doing well. That makes sense.

DERYUGINA: Yes, immediate drop in income. But then, by 2007, they had recovered back to where they would have been absent the hurricane. And then starting in 2008 and pretty steadily after that, they were making more than these comparison individuals, and therefore more than they would have made absent the hurricane.

GUO: So you're saying that - and this was what I thought was so surprising about this paper. Like, you're saying that the people who were affected by Hurricane Katrina, like, they ended up making more money than they would have otherwise.

DERYUGINA: Yes, exactly.

GUO: What was your reaction when you first figured this out?

DERYUGINA: Well, my first reaction was, did we mess something up? Is this wrong?

(LAUGHTER)

GUO: Are these calculations right?

DERYUGINA: Let's - whenever you have a surprising finding, the first thing you want to do is make sure that it's not surprising because you made a mistake somewhere. And then when we figure it out that, no, these are the right results, of course, the next question is, why? Like, how? How did this actually happen?

GUO: So why were people earning more money after this hurricane? Like, what was the explanation that you all were able to come up with?

DERYUGINA: Yeah, so there is a couple of possible explanations that we looked at. And in fact, we found that it was two things that mattered. The first one is kind of a straightforward one where New Orleans became a more expensive city to live in, and as a result, wages also increased to compensate for the greater cost of living. Because so much housing was destroyed, the supply of housing kind of relative to demand was low. And so housing prices increased as a result of the hurricane. They weren't - it wasn't necessarily that housing got better, at least in the short run. But this is actually something that we do see with natural disasters is in the immediate aftermath, it's not uncommon for housing to get more expensive because of the destruction of the hurricane.

GUO: So there was, like, kind of, like, some kind of inflation that was happening...

DERYUGINA: Exactly.

GUO: In New Orleans.

DERYUGINA: Exactly.

GUO: And then - but then there's this other explanation that I thought was really interesting and surprising.

DERYUGINA: Yeah, so another key reason for why incomes went up in the long run is because people moved to higher-wage places, to more economically prosperous places, and were able to earn kind of the prevailing wage for that area, which was higher than what they were earning in New Orleans.

GUO: So you were able to see - using this data, you were able to see, oh, they were filing their taxes in New Orleans. And then after Hurricane Katrina, they moved to this other place. It's a lot richer - maybe Chicago. And they're filing their taxes from Chicago. And they're earning a lot more money than they would have.

DERYUGINA: Exactly.

GUO: Yeah, that's amazing.

DERYUGINA: Yes, which I think raises the question of, you know, why were people living in New Orleans in the first place?

GUO: Right.

DERYUGINA: Like, you know, because obviously they could have moved even without the hurricanes, so why were they staying in a place where they were earning less than they could have somewhere else?

GUO: You did this follow-up paper - right? - where you looked at not just financial well-being but, like, physical well-being. And what did you find in that paper?

DERYUGINA: Yeah, so we got another set of administrative records, this time from Medicare. So we were able to track the locations and mortality of individuals age 65 and older and also individuals on long-term disability. And we again looked at people who were in New Orleans the year before the hurricane and tracked what happened to their mortality. And what we found is that in the year of the hurricane, we see a lot of excess mortality, a lot of extra deaths due to the hurricane.

GUO: Yeah.

DERYUGINA: This is, unfortunately, not particularly surprising. But what is surprising is we then find a decrease in the mortality rate to the point that by, you know, almost a decade later, you're more likely to be alive if you were in New Orleans than if you were in one of our comparison cities.

GUO: So if you survived the hurricane in New Orleans, you were more likely to be alive many years later.

DERYUGINA: No, this is actually not conditional on surviving the hurricane.

GUO: Oh.

DERYUGINA: So even counting the extra deaths from the hurricane...

GUO: Oh, my gosh.

DERYUGINA: ...You're more likely to be alive by the end of 2013 than if the hurricane hadn't happened.

GUO: Wow. And so what was driving that?

DERYUGINA: So we found that in this case, the main explanation is relocating to lower mortality places. So New Orleans was not prosperous economically. It was also at the bottom in terms of public health care metrics.

GUO: Uh-huh.

DERYUGINA: And in most cases, people moved to lower mortality places. And we found basically a 1-for-1 relationship of the mortality in the place you move to and your own subsequent mortality, and that that can explain most of the mortality decrease we observed in total.

GUO: Oh, wow. And so putting together these two papers, what you're finding - right? - is that Hurricane Katrina caused people to move, evacuate, and a lot of people ended up staying in places where wages were higher, where communities were, like, literally healthier. And this caused people to earn more money than they would have and also live longer than they would have.

DERYUGINA: Exactly. Yes, that's right.

GUO: And that's - I feel like that really just puts an emphasis point on the question then - if that's true, if people were better off leaving New Orleans, why didn't they move earlier? Why did they stay? Why did it take a hurricane to force them from this place, which according to the data - right? - wasn't great for their salaries, their income, wasn't great for their health even?

DERYUGINA: Yeah. And I think it's a really important question. And it's not just kind of a - interesting from an academic standpoint question, but it has ramifications for how we deal with climate change.

GUO: Yeah. I mean, I feel like as we try to make that very difficult choice of - do we stay in a place that's going to get constantly ravaged by an increasing number of whatever - wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, whatever? When is it worth it to stay and when is it worth it to go, right?

DERYUGINA: Yes, exactly. So that's a question an individual can ask themselves, but it's also a question that local governments should be asking of - how do we deal with these communities as a whole? - because as an individual, there is only so much you can do on your own because of the difficulties of coordinating and the difficulties of knowing what risks you even face and so on. So I think this is one area where we almost certainly will need governments to be thinking as well.

GUO: Yeah. And so the reason I thought that this Katrina research of yours was so interesting and so profound is that it kind of - it's another reason to study natural disasters. It's not just that, you know, we need to understand natural disasters because we need to understand how we deal with them and how we can respond to them efficiently or whatever. But, like, a natural disaster is this thing, this massive dislocation that - it breaks us out of our regular lives, and, you know, it forces us sometimes to move away from the place that we have called home for many years. And in doing that, by forcing this giant change onto people, it can reveal something deeper, I think, about how our society works. And in this case, it's not just a paper about Hurricane Katrina, right? It's a paper about the power of place, the power of our communities or our adopted communities to change the trajectory of our lives.

DERYUGINA: Yes, exactly. I think that's a key takeaway lesson from this line of research, is that where we live really matters for our economic well-being and for our physical well-being. And it's ultimately - you know, as an individual, we can never know what would have been for ourselves personally.

GUO: Yeah.

DERYUGINA: But as researchers, we can try to answer questions like these with data, and I think that's really neat.

GUO: Tatyana, we have had such a fascinating conversation today. Thank you so much for talking to us.

DERYUGINA: Thank you very much for having me here. It's been a pleasure.

This is planet money from NPR the other day
I got a chance to talk to someone who really changed how I think about economics and economic research
I kind of want to just ask you do you remember me?
No
You mean have we met before?
Tatiana de Rugna is an economist and a professor at the University of Illinois. Yeah
Okay, I'm sorry. I do not I have no recollection whatsoever. No
Sorry before she was a professor Tatiana was a teaching assistant
In fact, she was the teaching assistant for a class that I took in college. Oh, wow
I'm so I'm sorry. I don't remember you but that's so cool. Tatiana did not remember me at all, but I
Remembered her because the point of that class was to teach us how to write an economics research paper
And the thing I learned from Tatiana was that being an economist is hard
You want to answer all these big important questions?
But you need data and even more than that you ideally want something random that happens to one group of people
But not another economists call this a natural experiment
I remember you telling us about the project that you were working on which was about hurricanes and we were thinking
Oh, yeah, like hurricanes
terrible things but what a
perfect
Subject of an economics paper because hurricanes are random. They're kind of like these great natural experiments
Like that's very interesting. Yes, that's from an economist standpoint
That is a great feature of a hurricane is the unpredictability of it. The fact that people
Do not see it coming. Yes, that is an extremely
Economist II viewpoint but studying hurricanes was just the start for Tatiana over the past decade
Tatiana has made an entire career out of studying natural disasters and her research
Well these days it's become really really important
Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Jeff Guo. It feels like every week
We see another headline about a record-breaking earthquake
wildfire
hurricane
Scientists say this might be the new normal that climate change is going to make the weather
Weirder and wilder and
Deadlier, which is why today on the show
I wanted to talk to Tatiana because she's become this leading expert on the economics of natural disasters
How we respond to them how they affect the economy and also how they completely change our lives
That research project that Tatiana started about hurricanes. It led to this surprising almost
Unbelievable conclusion and it completely altered how I see the world

Way back when Tatiana started researching natural disasters
She realized there's actually a lot. We don't know about their long-term
economic consequences like yeah
There are macroeconomic studies about like what happens to a country's GDP after a disaster
But we know a lot less about how individuals how communities recover from these things
Trying to understand those questions how we respond to natural disasters how we should be responding to natural disasters
That is a big part of Tatiana's research
So to start off our conversation we talked about the different ways our society handles disaster relief from
Insurance to federal aid to charity for instance one of Tatiana's recent studies looked at tornadoes
To try to answer this simple question about charitable donations that for a long time
We didn't actually know the answer to
Yeah, so in that study we are trying to understand
whether
charitable giving in the aftermath of a disaster comes at the expense of other causes because
Whether we see this extra charitable giving is a good thing kind of depends on where it's coming from in
people's budgets
Yeah, cuz it's like it's a good thing if it's like coming out of the junk food budget
But maybe less of a good thing if it's coming out of the like money I was gonna give to orphans budget
Exactly, exactly. And and what did you what did you find?
Well, we found that total giving went up in the aftermath of a tornado
The charity budget got bigger in
Exactly. Uh-huh. The charity budget got bigger and we also find some evidence that it got bigger
Persistently, like if you look at giving, you know that the next year it remains slightly
Elevated so it expanded not just in that year, but in subsequent years as well
It made people more charitable. Yes. Why do you think that is?
So the cynical explanation is that they got on Red Cross's mailing list and started getting lots of texts
And phone calls from the Red Cross
But the the less cynical explanation is you know, it feels good to give
And so maybe people realized hey, I don't miss that junk food that I would have bought
I really like feeling like I was able to help a human being in need and they
Continue to give more because of that
Experience. Yeah. Yeah, I
Definitely buy that argument
But in the grand scheme of things is this kind of individual charitable giving is that a big part of how people
in America
recover from
natural disasters
No for most people it's gonna come from hopefully their insurance policy that they had as well as
from the government
It feels like if climate change is gonna make these natural disasters more and more common
Does the way that we have to do?
Insurance also have to change
Absolutely, so the insurance market is in a huge turmoil right now
Because they're realizing that the risks are going up and so premiums have to go up
But they're running into a lot of resistance. Well, you hear in Florida, right like all these insurers
They're saying well, we're we're now we can't deal with this market anymore. We're gonna pull out
We don't really want to offer insurance in Florida anymore
Yes, and you see a similar thing happening with California and wildfire
Insurance partly it happens because there's limits on what premium increases they can put in and so they're saying well
If we can't do these premium increases, then we're not gonna be in this market at all
oh, so what you're saying is
Like the government won't let them raise the price of insurance enough to to make the insurance work
In some cases, yes
Because I see how that makes sense like you don't want you know what insurers to price gouge exactly
Yeah, I think it's a market that needs some regulation, but it's a very complicated market to regulate
Yeah, and it kind of feels like you know insurance prices. They're almost this
tool right through which you know you influence people to
Take seriously the consequences of climate change of you know more natural disasters more flooding more wildfires
more all of these things to to to make that decision not just you know abstract and what the scientists are saying but
Like a literal cost a price of the kind of risk that they're gonna be living through
Yes, exactly. And that is why it can be a very useful tool
I think where we can do better is
communicating to people that
This isn't just price gouging. This actually reflects our best guess as to the risk that
You're facing and I think a lot of people probably have a hard time believing that
Because disasters are very rare things and so there's almost like this sense of it can't happen to me
This is an outrageous price nothing's happened, you know in the last 20 years
Therefore, it's not going to happen
Coming up we talk about a paper of Tatiana's that totally surprised me totally changed how I see the world
It was about hurricane Katrina
So I want to talk about this one paper of yours
And I remember reading it a couple years back and when I read it I was like
Totally blown away like it was so so surprising the thing that you found and this was a paper about hurricane Katrina
And I think it really changed how I think about
Not just natural disasters, but I think this was a paper that kind of revealed something
deeper about
society and about how we choose to live our lives and I'm
Excited to talk to you about it. Yeah, I'm excited to tell you about it. So
when it came to
studying hurricane Katrina
In my fourth year of grad school
I was a visiting PhD student at the University of Chicago and I spent quite a bit of time talking to
Steve Levitt and at one freekonomics guy. Yes. Yes
so
So at one point we were discussing hurricane Katrina and wondering what happened to the victims in the long run
Did they recover back to where they were were they permanently scarred by?
This hurricane and I thought okay, maybe actually this is a question we can answer
Yeah, so what what were you expecting to find?
So I thought that we would find
persistent long-term declines in income
Given how bad the hurricane was how many people were involuntarily displaced?
I thought that not only we'd find kind of a sharp decline in income in the short run
But it would persist for years like it would scar their careers and sort of their their lives and their financial
Exactly exactly
But it's still useful to know right just to be able to quantify how
That it is and it's very surprising to me that we didn't actually
Know the the answer to this to this like, you know five years ten years down the road question
Yeah, and I think you know
When you know what we had to do to get that answer. It's perhaps less surprising
We ended up teaming up with an economist who was working at the US Treasury and had access to
Individual tax records and that's how we were able to identify people who were living in New Orleans
Before the hurricane and then track them through their tax records regardless of where they moved to
afterwards so you do need very
Specialized hard-to-access data to do these kinds of studies because that tax data like they keep that locked up, right?
It's very hard to get access to that. Oh, yes. I never touched the data myself
No, no, yeah Laura Kawano our co-author at
US Treasury at that time. She was the one that
Did all the all the data work? So it's very well protected. So you were able to
Get all this data on
all these people who
Had been living in New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina and you were able to follow them for like, you know
almost a decade after the hurricane hit and
you
compared them to
other people who lived in similar places
just to get a sense of what their life might have been like if the hurricane hadn't happened and
Exactly, and when you made that comparison and you got all the data together and you crunched everything. What did you find?
Well, we found that in
2005 and 2006
People from New Orleans were doing noticeably worse. Okay, so it's like immediately after the hurricane like people are not doing well
That makes sense. Yes immediate drop in income, but then
by 2007 they had recovered back to where they would have been absent the hurricane and then starting in
2008 and pretty steadily after that they were able to
Making more than these comparison individuals and therefore more than they would have made
absent the hurricane so
So you're saying that and this was what this is what I thought was so surprising about this paper like
you're saying that
The people who were affected by Hurricane Katrina like they ended up making more money than they would have otherwise
Yes, exactly. What was your reaction when you when you first figured this out?
Well, my first reaction was did we mess something up is this
Whatever you have a surprising finding the first thing you want to do is make sure that it's not surprising because you made a mistake
somewhere and then when we
Figured out that no, these are the right results. Of course. The next question is why like how how
Did this actually happen?
So why why were people earning more money after this hurricane?
Like what was the explanation that you all were able to come up with? Yeah, so there is a couple of
possible explanations that we looked at and in fact, we found that it was two things that mattered
the first one is
Kind of a straightforward one where New Orleans became a more expensive city to live in and as a result
Wages also increased to compensate for the greater cost of living
Because so much housing was destroyed the supply of housing kind of relative to demand was low
And so housing prices increased as a result of the hurricane
They weren't it wasn't necessarily the housing got better at least in the short run
But this is actually something that we do see with natural disasters is in the immediate aftermath
It's not uncommon for housing to get more expensive because of the destruction of the hurricane
So there was like so there's like kind of like in some kind of inflation that was happening
Exactly in New Orleans exactly and then but but then there's this other explanation that I thought was really interesting and
Surprising. Yeah
so another key reason for why incomes went up in the long run is because people moved to
higher wage places to more economically prosperous places and were able to earn kind of the
Prevailing wage for that area which was higher than what they were earning in New Orleans
So you were able to see using this data you you're able to see oh they were filing their taxes in New Orleans
And then after Hurricane Katrina, they moved to this other place
It's a lot richer maybe Chicago and they're filing their taxes from Chicago and they're earning a lot more money than they would have
Exactly. Yeah, that's amazing. Yes, which I think raises the question of you know
Why were people living in New Orleans in the first place like, you know, because it was obviously they could have moved
Even without the hurricanes
So why were they staying in a place where they were earning less than they could have somewhere else?
You did this follow-up paper, right where you looked at not just financial well-being but like physical
Well-being and what did you find in that paper? Yeah
So we got another set of administrative records this time from Medicare
so we were able to track the locations and mortality of
Individuals age 65 and older and also individuals on long-term
Disability and we again looked at people who were in New Orleans
the year before the hurricane and tracked what happened to their mortality and
What we found is that in the year of the hurricane we see a lot of excess
Mortality a lot of extra deaths due to the hurricane. Yeah, this is unfortunately not particularly surprising
but what is surprising is
we then find a
decrease in the mortality rate to the point that by you know
Almost a decade later
You're more likely to be alive if you were in New Orleans then if you were in one of our
comparison cities
So if you survived the hurricane in New Orleans
You were more likely to be alive
No, this is actually not conditional on surviving the hurricane. So even counting the extra deaths
From the hurricane you're more likely to be alive by the end of
2013 then if
The hurricane hadn't happened. Wow. And so what was driving that?
so we found that in this case the main explanation is
Relocating to lower mortality places. So New Orleans was not prosperous economically
It was also at the bottom in terms of public health care metrics
and
in most cases people move to lower mortality places and we found
Basically a one-for-one relationship of the
Mortality in the place you move to and your own
subsequent mortality and
That that can explain most of the mortality decrease we observe in total
oh wow, and so so putting together these two papers what you're finding right is that
hurricane Katrina caused people to
move evacuate and a lot of people ended up staying in places where
wages were higher where
Communities were like literally healthier and this caused people to
Earn more money than they would have and also live longer than they would have
Exactly. Yes, that's right. And that's it. I feel like that really just puts an emphasis point on the question then
If that's true if people were better off leaving New Orleans, why didn't they move earlier? Why did they stay?
why did it take a hurricane to force them from
this place which
According to the data right wasn't great for their salaries their income wasn't great for their health even
yeah, and I think it's a really important question and it's not just
kind of a
interesting from an academic standpoint question, but it has
ramifications for how we deal with climate change. Yeah, I mean I feel like
as we try to make that very difficult choice of
Do we stay in a place that's going to get constantly ravaged by an increasing number of
Whatever wildfires tornadoes hurricanes, whatever
When is it worth it to stay and when is it worth it to go? Right? Yes, exactly
So that's a question an individual can ask themselves, but it's also a question that
local governments
Should be asking of how do we deal with these?
communities as a whole because
As an individual there's only so much you can do on your own
because of the difficulties of
Coordinating and the difficulties of knowing what risk you even face and so on
So I think this is one area where we almost certainly will need
Governments to be thinking as well
Yeah, and so the reason I thought that this Katrina research of yours was so
interesting and so profound is that it
It kind of it
It's another reason to study natural disasters
it's not just that you know, we need to understand natural disasters because
We need to understand how we deal with them and how we can respond to them efficiently or whatever
but like a natural disaster is this thing this
massive dislocation that it breaks us out of our regular lives and
You know, it forces us sometimes to move away from the place that we have called home for many years and in
Doing that by forcing this giant change onto onto people it can reveal something deeper
I think about how our
Society works and in this case, it's
It's not just a paper about Hurricane Katrina, right? It's a paper about
the power of
Place the power of our communities or our adopted communities to
Change the trajectory of our lives. Yes, exactly. I think that's a key takeaway lesson from
this line of research is
that where we live
really matters for our economic well-being and for our
Physical well-being and it's ultimately, you know as an individual we can never know what would have been for ourselves
personally, but as
Researchers we can try to answer questions like these with data and I think that's really neat
Tatiana we have had such a fascinating conversation today. Thank you so much for talking to us. Thank you very much for having me here
