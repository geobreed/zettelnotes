As head of the FTC, Lina Khan is bringing a case against Amazon that echoes her law school paper on the tech company's monopoly power.

When Lina Khan was in law school back in 2017, she wrote a law review article called 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,' that went kinda viral in policy circles. In it, she argued that antitrust enforcement in the U.S. was behind the times. For decades, regulators had focused narrowly on consumer welfare, and they'd bring companies to court only when they thought consumers were being harmed by things like rising prices. But in the age of digital platforms like Amazon and Facebook, Khan argued in the article, the time had come for a more proactive approach to antitrust.

Just four years later, President Biden appointed Lina Khan to be the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission, one of the main government agencies responsible for enforcing antitrust in America, putting her in the rare position of putting some of her ideas into practice.

Now, two years into the job, Khan has taken some big swings at big tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. But the FTC has also faced a couple of big losses in the courts. On today's show, a conversation with FTC Chair Lina Khan on what it's like to try to turn audacious theory into bureaucratic practice, the FTC's new lawsuit against Amazon, and what it all means for business as usual.

Interview Highlights

On the FTC's loss in the Meta/Within Unlimited case, and how there were some small victories for the FTC in the court's decision:

So the FTC's case, seeking to block Meta's acquisition of Within, was really about what's known as "potential competition." And so the claims in the case included noting that Meta itself had actually been planning to enter this market itself, and it ended up doing this acquisition in ways that short-circuited that organic competition that we would have seen if Meta had organically looked to enter. [...] It's true, we did not win and we were disappointed by that, but the court's decision also had a whole set of really important determinations about how [the] potential competition doctrine applies in digital markets. So in the case, one of Facebook's arguments was that this doctrine is so old it doesn't even apply to these markets, and the court firmly rejected that. [The judge] said, 'No, this potential competition doctrine is alive and well, even in markets like digital markets, even relating to virtual reality,' and he noted a whole set of important ways that that doctrine applies in this market, and gave us a whole set of wins that we can build on in any future cases.

On the FTC's case against Amazon and what Khan sees as Amazon's anti-competitive practices:

In today's digital economy, if you want to be visible in e-commerce, you generally have to sell on Amazon, and the lawsuit lays out a set of tactics that Amazon has deployed against those merchants that we believe are anti-competitive. It has basically dictated policies that say, 'If you sell on Amazon, you can't sell anywhere else for a lower price, so you can't list your products on any other website for a price that's lower than what you're listing on Amazon.' And one reason that ends up being problematic is because Amazon has also been hiking the fees that it charges these merchants. So these merchants face higher costs on Amazon, but are not able to raise their price on Amazon to reflect those higher costs. And instead, they have to either raise their price on other websites, or they just stop selling anywhere else entirely because Amazon is so punitive when it does see that people have, you know, listed their products elsewhere for a lower price. And so at the end of the day, Amazon's tactics are actually resulting in higher prices, not just on Amazon, but across the rest of the economy.

On how her strategy and thinking about Amazon's anti-competitive tactics has changed from when she was a law student to now that she is FTC Chair:

The exercise of doing independent research and writing an academic paper is very different from being a law enforcer, where you have subpoena power, you can investigate what's really going on, and ultimately you're charged with (if you bring a complaint) making sure you're alleging law violations and setting up that case to succeed in court. That said, I'll also note that when you have the monopoly playbook, there are different life cycles of where you can be at any given moment, and the tactics that a firm will take to achieve monopoly power will look different from the tactics that it deploys once it's become a monopoly and is really focused on protecting that monopoly and exploiting that monopoly power. And so the case that we brought really reflects Amazon in the year 2023, and what we believe is now extraction mode, where having cemented its monopoly power, having locked out rivals through [these] illegal tactics, it's able to extract from customers, both on the consumer side as well on the seller side. And so that's what the case is about.

On how she views her tenure so far as FTC Chair, despite setbacks in court:

As a law enforcer, one of the things that I think most about is deterrence. You really want to ensure that firms are not engaging in illegal behavior in the first instance. And one set of comments that have really been promising for us, is hearing from prominent dealmakers, prominent bankers, who will say, 'You know, a few years back when I was part of conversations about whether to do a merger, we never really talked about antitrust until the very, very, very end, if at all. And now that's totally different. We talk about antitrust on day one.' And there are a whole bunch of deals that are not even happening because there's a recognition that they would be legally suspect from an antitrust point of view. So as an enforcer, that deterrence is a huge marker of success, right? We want to be making sure we're conserving our resources, that firms are not engaging in illegal mergers in the first instance, and there are a whole set of indications that that's happening.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)

ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:

Last week, I had a chance to sit down with Lina Khan.

Hey.

LINA KHAN: Hello. Hey. I'm Lina.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Hey. Alexi.

KHAN: Nice to meet you.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Nice to meet you.

JEFF GUO, HOST:

And OK, Alexi, I have to say, this was super exciting 'cause Lina Khan is the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, which, among other things, regulates how big companies can get in the U.S.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: OK. So just to start, I have to ask, when you were a kid, was Monopoly your favorite board game?

KHAN: (Laughter) No. I think it was probably, like, Snakes and Ladders.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Nevertheless, Lina is now helping set the rules for the real-life game of Monopoly playing out across the American economy. As FTC chair, she is one of the country's top antitrust cops, policing companies as they vie for bigger and bigger slices of any given market.

GUO: Now, for a long time, antitrust was kind of this sleepy policy backwater. The prevailing theory of how to police monopoly power had basically been to let the market sort it out on its own, unless you could prove that consumers were clearly getting harmed. But a few years ago, in 2017, Lina Khan rocketed into the national conversation with a simple but radical argument, which is that we had been doing everything wrong and that by now, it was exacting this hidden toll on our everyday lives.

KHAN: Monopoly power and consolidation can make the difference between whether you have to drive five miles to go to the hospital or whether you're driving 50 miles to go to the hospital. It can be the difference between whether you're paying $4 for eggs or $10 for eggs. It can make the difference between whether you can quit your job and have opportunities with a rival firm or whether you're, in fact, just stuck working for a company, even if they're docking your wages or worsening your working conditions. And so there are just very real material consequences of how we do antitrust.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In other words, the stakes are a lot bigger than a board game.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONIC BEAT'S "ADVENTURE TIME")

GUO: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Jeff Guo.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. In just a few years, Lina Khan went from a controversial new voice calling for antitrust reform to the person leading one of the main government agencies that could actually do something about it.

GUO: And as FTC chair, she's taken some big swings against some of the economy's most prominent tech giants. She's suffered a couple big setbacks. And now the FTC has filed one of the biggest antitrust cases in decades against Amazon, which we should say supports and pays to distribute some NPR content.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Today on the show, a conversation with Lina Khan, what it's like to try to turn audacious theory into bureaucratic practice and what it all means for business as usual.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONIC BEAT'S "ADVENTURE TIME")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: OK. So to kind of go back to your origins, tell me the story of how you fell in love with antitrust, at least as a kind of professional calling.

KHAN: So one of my first jobs after college was as a researcher and business journalist for a think tank. And one of my first assignments was a deep dive into the chicken industry, the poultry market. And pretty quickly, it became clear that the poultry market is structured like an hourglass. So you have millions of consumers on one side, thousands of farmers on the other side, and they're connected just by a handful of companies. And what that means practically is that if you're a chicken farmer today, to do business, oftentimes you're just dependent on a single company to get to market. And from interviewing these farmers, it became clear that that asymmetry of power was resulting in a lot of abuse. And farmers told me that they wanted to go speak out to the government, but the chicken companies threatened them and said, if you speak up, will retaliate against you. And it was such a instructive example of how concentrated private power, how monopoly power could also infringe on people's most fundamental liberties.

GUO: The origins of antitrust law go back to the Gilded Age. Listeners who've heard parts one and two of PLANET MONEY's series on antitrust in America will know the backstory to this history, but here's a quick recap. The late 19th century saw the rise of these massive new companies - these trusts, as they were called, like John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which were using their sheer size to push competitors out of the market.

KHAN: So the antitrust laws at the federal level were passed back in 1890 against the backdrop of this phenomenal Industrial Revolution that had delivered a lot of technological gains in progress but had also concentrated power over these new industries and a very small number of hands. And so you had farmers, for example, who were often dependent on a single railroad that was going through their town. And they saw how that concentrated power could result in discrimination. It could result in arbitrary price hikes. And there was a sense that who was winning and who was losing in our economy was not based on who on the merits was offering the best products or services or prices but really the whims of these gatekeepers. And so there was a big movement to really push Congress to pass a set of laws to really rein in some of this unchecked power. So in 1890, you had the Sherman Act that was passed. In 1914, and you had the Clayton Act, the FTC act, which created the Federal Trade Commission.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Is that your favorite one?

KHAN: Yeah, I think it has to be.

GUO: Over the next 60 years, the government took a pretty aggressive approach to policing anti-competitive behavior, regularly stopping companies from merging or even breaking up companies they argued had gotten too big, until the 1970s, when there was a backlash to all this aggressive enforcement, and the pendulum swung the other way.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: A new way of thinking about antitrust started to take hold, which essentially said the fact that some shoe manufacturer or pie company is gobbling up market share from its competitors isn't necessarily a bad thing. The only thing we should really be worrying about is whether actual consumers are harmed by things like rising prices or fewer kinds of products. What mattered should be consumer welfare.

GUO: And that consumer welfare standard, as it was christened, set the stage for the next 40 years. Antitrust regulators became a lot more hands-off. The market, the thinking went, would solve a lot of these problems all on its own.

KHAN: There was a view that if you ever had, you know, monopolization in the economy and that monopoly started to hike prices or hurt its customers, that that monopoly power would be disciplined by a new set of companies that would rush in and try to take business away from the monopoly.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This new paradigm in antitrust thinking was spelled out most famously by a legal scholar named Robert Bork in his book "The Antitrust Paradox." Antitrust, he argued, the law that's supposed to help competition, was actually harming it by intervening on behalf of particular companies. That was the paradox.

GUO: And Bork's view - that has become mainstream. That was the paradigm Lina Kahn decided to attack when she was a law student at Yale back in 2017, when she wrote a provocative paper for the Yale Law Journal, playing off the title of Bork's famous book, "The Antitrust Paradox."

KHAN: The paper was called "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox."

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And what was the vision you laid out in that paper for what needed to change when it came to antitrust policy in the U.S.?

KHAN: So that paper is - that I wrote, you know, as a student, in a very different role than the one I'm in right now, basically argued that the shift in antitrust that we had seen in the '70s and '80s now created serious blind spots in how we enforce the laws against monopolies. And those blind spots were especially acute in digital markets.

GUO: In her paper, Lina pointed to the wave of social media platforms and online marketplaces - places like Amazon that had come to define this new internet economy. These new business models, she argued, they'd started to pose whole new kinds of antitrust threats that couldn't be captured by a narrow definition of consumer welfare, which is based on things like price or product variety.

KHAN: One of the arguments was that a focus on short-term price effects, for example, could disable us from recognizing monopoly power in its earlier stages. Especially in digital markets, there can be a real premium on getting big as quickly as you can. And when you're looking to do that, you may not be focused on short-term profits in the same way. You're really looking to expand, to build, you know, a huge user base, to build market share. And so some of the tactics that firms can deploy in those early stages can be anti-competitive, but they can really fall off the radar from antitrust enforcers if they're just looking at, for example, price or output as key metrics.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In her 2017 Law Review article, Lina argued it was time to drastically shift our approach to antitrust enforcement, to return, in many ways, to the spirit of the original antitrust laws that had led to the breakup of Gilded Age behemoths like Standard Oil. The paper suggested that similar action needed to be taken now by taking steps that included potentially breaking up Amazon.

GUO: Lina argued that focusing too narrowly on consumer harm had allowed a handful of tech companies and digital platforms to get so big and powerful, it had become nearly impossible for new businesses to compete. Antitrust enforcement, she said, needed to go back to a more proactive approach.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The paper went kind of viral. People went bananas. And it helped catapult Lina and a wider group of scholars calling for antitrust reform into the public sphere. For a lot of scholars, it was a rallying cry, though others saw this reform movement as backsliding and dismissed it as a kind of vintage way of looking at monopolies. They called it hipster antitrust.

Do you identify as a hipster in the rest of your life?

KHAN: (Laughter) Probably not.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: (Laughter) OK.

Hipster or not, Lina became kind of famous in policy circles. And back in 2019, when our colleagues Jacob Goldstein and Kenny Malone interviewed her for PLANET MONEY, they asked her a hypothetical.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

KENNY MALONE: If you had all the antitrust power in the world, what would you do?

JACOB GOLDSTEIN: Do you want a title? We're going to make you the ruler of antitrust in America.

KHAN: That seems kind of antithetical to the spirit of antitrust.

GOLDSTEIN: Well played.

KHAN: (Laughter).

GOLDSTEIN: Oh.

MALONE: Yeah, that's fair.

GUO: Well, just two years after that conversation in 2021, it kind of happened. President Joe Biden appointed Lina to be the chair of the Federal Trade Commission. That is about as close as you can get to being the ruler of antitrust in America. All of a sudden, Lina went from an outspoken academic to someone on the inside, someone at the helm of antitrust enforcement in America. And as Chair Khan, she's had a rare chance to put some of her ideas into actual practice.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So once you kind of became the chair, like, did it seem like it was going to be easy?

KHAN: No.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Elaborate.

(LAUGHTER)

KHAN: So look. I mean, you know, the FTC is this remarkable agency, but we're small. We're around 1,200 people. We're smaller today than we were at various points in the 1970s, even as the economy has continued to expand significantly. We're also outgunned oftentimes. You know, at base, when the FTC it's doing its job, when it's taking on, you know, monopolies that we believe have illegally used their monopoly power, that's pitting the agency against some of the most powerful and well-resourced companies in our entire economy.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You're kind of, like, taking on the oil barons of our era, in a way. Do you think about it that way?

KHAN: I think it's fair to think that, you know, there are certain markers of the Gilded Age, once again, that we're living through. And so, you know, the robber barons and the industrial trusts that the FTC was charged with taking on a century ago - we're, once again, facing similar battles.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONIC BEAT'S "ADVENTURE TIME")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: After the break, how those battles have started to shape up since Lina Khan leapt from the ivory tower into the enforcer's chair.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONIC BEAT'S "ADVENTURE TIME")

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In June of 2021, Lina Khan was appointed by President Biden to chair of the Federal Trade Commission. Now, the FTC isn't the only agency tasked with enforcing antitrust laws in the U.S. - there's also the DOJ and state attorneys general. But Lina Khan has become one of the top monopoly cops in the country.

GUO: And like any other cop, her job is not to make the law, but to enforce it. Her job is to investigate companies, review proposed mergers, figure out if any of them are breaking antitrust laws, and if they are, she can file lawsuits against them. But the final decision on those cases is up to the courts.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And if you want to get a sense of Lina Khan's antitrust philosophy, how she's trying to enforce antitrust law more aggressively and even expand the law beyond the consumer welfare standard, a good place to start would be the merger guidelines.

GUO: The merger guidelines are kind of like the government's antitrust manual. They lay out how the FTC and the Department of Justice will investigate company mergers, like what red flags they're looking for, what kinds of mergers they'll try to block for being anti-competitive.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: After Lina became chair, the FTC decided to revise and update the merger guidelines. Lina says they've been revised periodically over the last few decades, but significant parts hadn't been revised since 2010.

KHAN: And we believe that a lot had changed since 2010. I think one of the worries has been that the agencies have used, at various points, models and theories that haven't always mapped onto the reality of what happens once firms merge and how firms can use their power.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And so Lina pulled a move from earlier in her career when she studied the impacts of monopoly power on chicken farmers by talking to them directly. She teamed up with the DOJ to collect information directly from the public about how mergers have worked in the time of online platforms like Facebook or Amazon or Uber.

KHAN: So we got a lot of input. We did a bunch of listening sessions with farmers, with nurses, with health care workers more generally, with journalists, with musicians, really with people across the economy to understand on the ground, what has it looked like when you've seen mergers in your sector, and what have the real-world effects been? You know, we got thousands and thousands of comments, a lot of them from workers who had noted, for example, the ways in which mergers that have gone through have ended up resulting in their pay being cut, their work schedules becoming less predictable, their working conditions becoming worse.

We heard from, you know, small businesses, independent businesses, about how mergers have resulted in them being muscled out of markets. Not because they can't compete, not because customers don't want their products, but because firms that have merged have been able to use their muscle to bully firms and push them out. And so the revisions that we put forward this summer, for example, address platform markets, for the first time ever, they address labor markets, they make clear that the agencies are going to look at how mergers could potentially limit competition not just in ways that will harm consumers but also in ways that could harm workers and labor.

GUO: The FTC and DOJ put out a draft of the new merger guidelines this summer, and they give you a sense of how Lina is exploring broader types of harm than many of her predecessors. The FTC is now looking not just at how consumers might be harmed by a merger by, you know, higher prices or less product variety, but also at how a merger might affect, you know, workers. And in speeches and articles, she's also talked about harm to digital security, harm to privacy.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But the merger guidelines are only one tool she has to change the way companies behave. For this agenda to have any real teeth, it comes down to filing actual lawsuits against companies that Lina Khan and the FTC allege have broken antitrust law.

GUO: And with those lawsuits, she's taken some pretty big swings. We asked Lina to walk us through four of those lawsuits. The first one was a case the FTC refiled against Facebook, arguing that some high-profile acquisitions from the last decade or so shouldn't have been allowed.

KHAN: And one of the claims there was that Facebook had become dominant on the desktop market. And then they quickly saw that the market at later stage was shifting to mobile, and they saw that firms like Instagram and WhatsApp instead were threatening to become more dominant in the mobile space and make Facebook irrelevant. And so we allege Facebook made those acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp because it viewed them as a threat in the mobile market.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The FTC is arguing that the courts should unwind the deal. Force Facebook to divest itself of WhatsApp and Instagram. We reached out to Facebook's parent company, Meta, for comment, and they referred us to a previous statement in which they say, quote, "our investments in Instagram and WhatsApp transformed them into what they are today. They've been good for competition and good for the people and businesses that choose to use our products." The court has not yet made a decision on this case. The FTC's lawsuit is still pending.

GUO: But the case shows how Lina Khan and the FTC are now thinking about why it's so important to stop anti-competitive acquisitions earlier in the process. The idea is that if regulators aren't paying close enough attention to emerging markets, especially in tech, huge dominant firms can just buy up any would-be rivals and scuttle that market before it ever really gets going.

KHAN: These technological inflection points can be really important moments of new competition. And so the incumbents oftentimes feel threatened during these moments. And so we want to be making sure that we're not allowing dominant monopolies today to also solidify their monopoly power in tomorrow's markets through these acquisitions.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And this is the underlying philosophy that's also motivating the second lawsuit we're going to talk about, another case the FTC brought against Facebook, this one after it had been rebranded to Meta.

GUO: Meta was trying to acquire a virtual reality company called Within Unlimited. And even though that VR market was still in its tiniest infancy, the FTC argued that Meta's behavior was still anti-competitive because it preempted competition that might otherwise bloom in the virtual reality space.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And so Lina and the FTC used an old legal theory that hadn't been used much for decades, since basically before the whole backlash against aggressive antitrust enforcement.

KHAN: So the FTC's case seeking to block Meta's acquisition of Within was really about what's known as potential competition. And so the claims in the case included noting that Meta itself had actually been planning to enter this market itself, and it ended up doing this acquisition in ways that short-circuited that organic competition that we would have seen if Meta had organically looked to enter. And so that was one of the counts. We also noted that just the mere fact that Meta was potentially going to enter also ended up disciplining the existing players in the VR market.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now, in the case of Meta, Within Unlimited, the courts decided not to block that acquisition. Tell me a little bit about what happened in the decision and what lessons you're taking from that.

KHAN: So, look, we only bring cases where we believe there's a law violation, and our team did a terrific job putting together that case in a very compressed period of time. It's true, we - you know, we did not win, and we were disappointed by that. But the court's decision also had a whole set of really important determinations about how this potential competition doctrine applies in digital markets. So in the case, you know, one of Facebook's argument was that this doctrine is so old, it doesn't even apply to these markets. And the court firmly rejected that. He said, no, this potential competition doctrine is alive and well, even in markets like digital markets, even relating to virtual reality. And he noted a whole set of important ways that that doctrine applies in this market and gave us a whole set of wins that we can build on in any future cases. But of course, any time we have setbacks in the court, we look closely at those opinions and try to figure out what could we do better?

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: According to the court, the argument the FTC made in this case was, quote, "impermissibly speculative," but the court did accept potential competition as a valid argument in theory, and Lina sees that as a kind of win.

GUO: Another one of her big swings - the FTC's attempt to block what are called vertical mergers. That's when companies buy up other companies in their industry that they don't directly compete with, like a car company buying a smaller tire manufacturer, for example. Under recent mainstream interpretations of antitrust law, vertical mergers are generally seen as OK. They're not seen as anti-competitive. They're even seen as a way to improve efficiency, which, you know, is good for consumers.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But Lina Khan argues those mergers can come at a big cost. They can give a company too much power in an industry, and you can see this argument playing out in case No. 3, the FTC's attempt to block Microsoft from acquiring a video game company called Activision Blizzard.

GUO: Microsoft and Activision Blizzard - they aren't direct competitors, not exactly. Microsoft makes the popular gaming console the Xbox, while Activision Blizzard makes games. But the FTC's case argued that this merger could allow Microsoft to starve other video game platforms like the PlayStation from getting access to big Activision games like, you know, "Call Of Duty."

KHAN: We've generally had a market where you could have platform-agnostic content developers that are able to reach video gamers through a whole set of platforms, and there's a risk that if this acquisition goes through, we'll instead see a shift to a series of walled gardens that will make it much more difficult for organic content to be getting to video game users.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But the courts decided again in this case against the FTC. They let Microsoft's vertical merger go through, saying the FTC hadn't proven the deal would hurt consumers, though the FTC is still pursuing a case post-merger.

GUO: This leads us to the fourth and final case that Lina walked us through, the one that many people across the world of antitrust had been waiting for for years. This fall, the FTC brought a case against the subject of her famous law school paper, against Amazon.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But the crux of the FTC's case against Amazon rests on more conventional antitrust arguments about consumer welfare, that Amazon had had a policy that harmed its third-party sellers, which ultimately had harmed consumers.

KHAN: So our lawsuit lays out how Amazon is, for example, harming the millions of merchants that rely on Amazon to access consumers. In today's digital economy, if you want to be visible in e-commerce, you generally have to sell on Amazon, and the lawsuit lays out a set of tactics that Amazon has deployed against those merchants that we believe are anti-competitive. It has, you know, basically dictated policies that say, if you sell on Amazon, you can't list your products on any other website for a price that's lower than what you're listing on Amazon.

And one reason that ends up being problematic is because Amazon has also been hiking the fees that it charges these merchants. So these merchants face higher costs on Amazon, but are not able to raise their price on Amazon to reflect those higher costs. And instead, they have to either raise their price on other websites or they just stop selling anywhere else entirely, because Amazon is so punitive when it does see that people have, you know, listed their products elsewhere for a lower price. And so at the end of the day, Amazon's tactics are actually resulting in higher prices, not just on Amazon but across the rest of the economy. And if you step back, you know, in a healthy, competitive market, if you have a company that's raising prices for its customers and making the service worse, you should expect competition, right? It creates an opening for new businesses to come in and take business away from that incumbent. But we really haven't seen that successfully in this market. And we allege that's in part because Amazon has engaged in illegal tactics to block rivals. And so it's able to harm its customers without really paying the price that it should in a competitive market.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: One thing that a lot of people have pointed out about this case is that it's not exactly the same prescription you called for in your famous law school paper. You know, and it kind of frames the harm on terms that are familiar to the consumer welfare standard way of thinking about monopoly power. Help us understand how your kind of thinking and strategy has changed between the time that you wrote that paper and now what you're bringing as chair of the FTC.

KHAN: I mean, I'll say as a general matter, the exercise of doing independent research and writing an academic paper is very different from being a law enforcer where you have subpoena power. You can investigate what's really going on, and ultimately, you're charged with - if you bring a complaint, making sure you're alleging law violations and setting up that case to succeed in court. That said, I'll also note that when you have the monopoly playbook, there are different life cycles of where you can be at any given moment. And the tactics that a firm will take to achieve monopoly power to become a monopoly will look different from the tactics that it deploys once it's become a monopoly and is really focused on protecting that monopoly and exploiting that monopoly power.

And so the case that we brought really reflects Amazon in the year 2023 and what we believe is now extraction mode, where having cemented its monopoly power, having locked out rivals through this illegal tactics, it's able to extract from customers both on the consumer side, as well on the seller side. And so that's what the case is about. If enforcers had investigated and decided to bring a case a decade ago, there's no doubt that the set of tactics that would have been a focus there would have looked different.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: We reached out to Amazon for comment, and they referred us to a statement released when the FTC filed its case. They called it a misguided lawsuit and said that if the case were successful, it would, quote, "force Amazon to engage in practices that actually harm consumers and the many businesses that sell in our store."

GUO: Lina Khan says this case is just getting started. It might take years to battle it out in the courts, but she does say that asking a judge to potentially break up Amazon is still on the table. As for her larger strategy of taking on ambitious cases and trying out novel legal doctrines...

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It seems like a number of critics argue that these last few cases that were lost - that they're a sign that you may be pushing antitrust enforcement beyond the boundaries of the actual law. Like, how do you respond to that critique?

KHAN: So we're absolutely dead-focused on making sure we are fully being faithful to the laws that Congress passed and the legal precedent on the books. And, you know, we've had a whole set of successes. We've probably been successful in around 20 merger cases, where after we filed the complaint, the companies walked away. Or after we did an investigation, the companies folded. That includes in the context of two really major vertical mergers. This was Lockheed's attempted acquisition of Aerojet, Nvidia's attempted acquisition of Arm. Blockbuster deals known as vertical deals, which have historically been seen as more difficult to challenge - companies walked away after the FTC filed its suit.

So obviously, the setbacks that we've had we've been disappointed by. We've kind of looked closely at what we can learn from them and do better. And ultimately, we carry the burden of explaining to the courts and persuading them about how these long-term antitrust principles apply in some of these newer markets. But as a law enforcer, one of the things that I think most about is deterrence. You really want to ensure that firms are not engaging in illegal behavior in the first instance. And one set of comments that have really been promising for us is hearing from prominent dealmakers, prominent bankers who will say, a few years back when I was part of conversations about whether to do a merger, we never really talked about antitrust until the very, very, very end, if at all.

And now that's totally different. We talk about antitrust on day one. And there are a whole bunch of deals that are not even happening because there's a recognition that they would be legally suspect from an antitrust point of view. So as an enforcer, that deterrence is a huge marker of success, right? We want to be making sure we're conserving our resources, that firms are not engaging in illegal mergers in the first instance. And there are a whole set of indications that that's happening.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Lina Khan, chair of the FTC. Thank you so much for chatting with us.

KHAN: Thanks for having me.

**faster whisper:**
This is Planet Money from NPR.
Last week, I had a chance to sit down with Lena Kahn.
Hey!
Hello!
Hey, I'm Lena.
Hey, Alexi.
Nice to meet you.
And okay, Alexi, I have to say this was super exciting because Lena Kahn is the
chair of the Federal Trade Commission, which, among other things, regulates how
big companies can get in the U.S.
Okay, so just to start, I have to ask, when you were a kid, was Monopoly your favorite
board game?
No, I think it was probably like Snakes and Ladders.
Nevertheless, Lena is now helping set the rules for the real-life game of Monopoly
playing out across the American economy.
As FTC chair, she is one of the country's top anti-trust cops, policing companies
as they vie for bigger and bigger slices of any given market.
Now, for a long time, anti-trust was kind of this sleepy policy backwater.
The prevailing theory of how to police monopoly power had basically been to let the market
sort it out on its own unless you could prove that consumers were clearly getting
harmed.
But a few years ago, in 2017, Lena Kahn rocketed into the national conversation with
a simple but radical argument, which is that we had been doing everything wrong
and that by now it was exacting this hidden toll on our everyday lives.
Monopoly power and consolidation can make the difference between whether you have to
drive five miles to go to the hospital or whether you're driving 50 miles to go to
the hospital.
It can be the difference between whether you're paying four dollars for eggs or
ten dollars for eggs.
It can make the difference between whether you can quit your job and have
opportunities with a rival firm or whether you're, in fact, just stuck
working for a company, even if they're docking your wages or worsening your
working conditions.
And so there are just very real material consequences of how we do antitrust.
In other words, the stakes are a lot bigger than a board game.
Hello and welcome to Planet Money.
I'm Jeff Kuo.
And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi.
In just a few years, Lena Kahn went from a controversial new voice calling for
antitrust reform to the person leading one of the main government agencies that
could actually do something about it.
As FTC chair, she's taken some big swings against some of the economy's most
prominent tech giants.
She's suffered a couple of big setbacks.
And now the FTC has filed one of the biggest antitrust cases in decades
against Amazon, which we should say supports and pays to distribute some NPR
content. Today on the show, a conversation with Lena Kahn, what it's
like to try to turn audacious theory into bureaucratic practice and what it
all means for business as usual.

Okay.
So to kind of go back to your origins, tell me the story of how you
fell in love with, with antitrust, at least as a kind of professional
calling.
So one of my first jobs after college was as a researcher and business
journalist for a think tank.
And one of my first assignments was a deep dive into the chicken
industry, the poultry market.
And pretty quickly it became clear that the poultry market is
structured like an hourglass.
So you have millions of consumers on one side, thousands of farmers on
the other side, and they're connected just by a handful of companies.
And what that means practically is that if you're a chicken farmer
today to do business, oftentimes you're just dependent on a
single company to get to market.
And from interviewing these farmers, it became clear that that
asymmetry of power was resulting in a lot of abuse.
And farmers told me that they wanted to go speak out to the
government, but the chicken companies threatened them and said,
if you speak up, we'll retaliate against you.
And it was such an instructive example of how concentrated private
power, how monopoly power could also infringe on people's most
fundamental liberties.
The origins of antitrust law go back to the Gilded Age.
Listeners who've heard parts one and two of Planet Money's series on
antitrust in America will know the backstory to this history.
But here's a quick recap.
The late 19th century saw the rise of these massive new companies,
these trusts, as they were called, like John D.
Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which were using their sheer size to
push competitors out of the market.
So the antitrust laws at the federal level were passed back in 1890
against the backdrop of this phenomenal industrial revolution that had
delivered a lot of technological gains in progress, but had also
concentrated power over these new industries and a very small
number of hands.
And so you had farmers, for example, who were often dependent on a single
railroad that was going through their town, and they saw how that
concentrated power could result in discrimination, it could result in
arbitrary price hikes.
And there was a sense that who was winning and who was losing in our
economy was not based on who on the merits was offering the best
products or services or prices, but really the whims of these gatekeepers.
And so there was a big movement to really push Congress to pass a set of
laws to really rein in some of this unchecked power.
So in 1890, you had the Sherman Act that was passed.
In 1914, you had the Clayton Act, the FTC Act, which created the
Federal Trade Commission.
Is that your favorite one?
Yeah, I think it has to be.
Over the next 60 years, the government took a pretty aggressive
approach to policing anti-competitive behavior, regularly stopping
companies from merging or even breaking up companies they argued had gotten
too big until the 1970s, when there was a backlash to all this aggressive
enforcement and the pendulum swung the other way.
A new way of thinking about antitrust started to take hold, which
essentially said the fact that some shoe manufacturer or pie company is
gobbling up market share from its competitors isn't necessarily a bad
thing. The only thing we should really be worrying about is whether
actual consumers are harmed by things like rising prices or fewer kinds of
products. What mattered should be consumer welfare.
And that consumer welfare standard, as it was christened, set the stage
for the next 40 years.
Antitrust regulators became a lot more hands off.
The market, the thinking went, would solve a lot of these problems all on
its own. There was a view that if you ever had, you know, monopolization
in the economy and that monopoly started to hike prices or hurt its
customers, that that monopoly power would be disciplined by a new set of
companies that would rush in and try to take business away from the
monopoly.
This new paradigm in antitrust thinking was spelled out most famously by
a legal scholar named Robert Bork in his book, The Antitrust Paradox.
Antitrust, he argued, the law that's supposed to help competition was
actually harming it by intervening on behalf of particular companies.
That was the paradox.
And Bork's view?
That has become mainstream.
That was the paradigm Lena Kahn decided to attack when she was a law
student at Yale back in 2017 when she wrote a provocative paper for
the Yale Law Journal playing off the title of Bork's famous book, The
Antitrust Paradox.
The paper was called Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.
And what was the vision you laid out in that paper for what needed to
change when it came to antitrust policy in the U.S.?
So that paper is that I wrote, you know, as a student in a very different
role than the one I'm in right now, basically argued that the shift in
antitrust that we had seen in the 70s and 80s now created serious
blind spots in how we enforce the laws against monopolies.
And those blind spots were especially acute in digital markets.
In her paper, Lena pointed to the wave of social media platforms and
online marketplaces, places like Amazon, that had come to define this
new Internet economy.
These new business models, she argued, they'd started to pose whole new
kinds of antitrust threats that couldn't be captured by a narrow
definition of consumer welfare, just based on things like price or
product variety.
One of the arguments was that a focus on short term price effects,
for example, could disable us from recognizing monopoly power in its
earlier stages, especially in digital markets.
There can be a real premium on getting big as quickly as you can.
And when you're looking to do that, you may not be focused on short term
profits in the same way.
You're really looking to expand, to build a huge user base, to
build market share.
And so some of the tactics that firms can deploy in those early
stages can be anti-competitive, but they can really fall off the
radar from antitrust enforcers if they're just looking at, for
example, price or output as key metrics.
In her 2017 law review article, Lina argued it was time to
drastically shift our approach to antitrust enforcement, to return
in many ways to the spirit of the original antitrust laws that had
led to the breakup of Gilded Age behemoths like Standard Oil.
The paper suggested that similar action needed to be taken now by
taking steps that included potentially breaking up Amazon.
Lina argued that focusing too narrowly on consumer harm had
allowed a handful of tech companies and digital platforms to
get so big and powerful, it had become nearly impossible for
new businesses to compete.
Antitrust enforcement, she said, needed to go back to a
more proactive approach.
The paper went kind of viral.
People went bananas.
And it helped catapult Lina and a wider group of scholars
calling for antitrust reform into the public sphere.
For a lot of scholars, it was a rallying cry.
Though others saw this reform movement as backsliding and
dismissed it as a kind of vintage way of looking at
monopolies.
They called it hipster antitrust.
Do you identify as a hipster in the rest of your life?
Probably not.
Hipster or not, Lina became kind of famous in policy
circles.
And back in 2019, when our colleagues, Jacob Goldstein
and Kenny Malone interviewed her for Planet Money, they
asked her a hypothetical.
If you had all the antitrust power in the world, what
would you do?
Do you want a title?
We're going to make you the ruler of antitrust in
America.
That seems kind of antithetical to the spirit
of antitrust.
Well played.
Well, just two years after that conversation in
2021, it kind of happened.
President Joe Biden appointed Lina to be the
chair of the Federal Trade Commission.
That is about as close as you can get to being the
ruler of antitrust in America.
All of a sudden, Lina went from an outspoken academic
to someone on the inside, someone at the helm of
antitrust enforcement in America.
And as chair con, she's had a rare chance to put
some of her ideas into actual practice.
So once you kind of became the chair, like,
did it seem like it was going to be easy?
No.
Elaborate.
So look, I mean, you know, the FTC is this
remarkable agency, but we're small.
We're around 1200 people.
We're smaller today than we were at various points
in the 1970s, even as the economy has continued
to expand significantly.
We're also outgunned oftentimes, you know, at
base when the FTC, it's doing its job, when
it's taking on, you know, monopolies that we
believe have illegally used their monopoly
power.
That's pitting the agency against some of the
most powerful and well-resourced companies
in our entire economy.
You're kind of like taking on the oil
barons of our era in a way.
Do you think about it that way?
I think it's fair to think that, you know,
there are certain markers of the Gilded Age
once again that we're living through.
And so, you know, the robber barons and the
industrial trusts that the FTC was charged
with taking on a century ago were once
again facing similar battles.
After the break, how those battles have
started to shape up since Lena Kahn leapt from
the ivory tower into the enforcer's chair.
In June of 2021, Lena Kahn was appointed by
President Biden to chair of the Federal
Trade Commission.
Now, the FTC isn't the only agency tasked
with enforcing antitrust laws in the U.S.
There's also the DOJ and state attorneys
general, but Lena Kahn has become one of
the top monopoly cops in the country.
And like any other cop, her job is not
to make the law, but to enforce it.
Her job is to investigate companies, review
proposed mergers, figure out if any of them
are breaking antitrust laws.
And if they are, she can file lawsuits
against them.
But the final decision on those cases is
up to the courts.
And if you want to get a sense of Lena
Kahn's antitrust philosophy, how she's
trying to enforce antitrust law more
aggressively and even expand the law
beyond the consumer welfare standard, a
good place to start would be the merger
guidelines.
The merger guidelines are kind of like
the government's antitrust manual.
They lay out how the FTC and the
Department of Justice will investigate
company mergers, like what red flags
they're looking for, what kinds of
mergers they'll try to block for being
anti-competitive.
After Lena became chair, the FTC
decided to revise and update the
merger guidelines.
Lena says they've been revised
periodically over the last few
decades, but significant parts hadn't
been revised since 2010.
And we believe that a lot had
changed since 2010.
I think one of the worries has been
that the agencies have used at various
points models and theories that
haven't always mapped onto the
reality of what happens once firms
merge and how firms can use their
power.
And so Lena pulled a move from
earlier in her career when she
studied the impacts of monopoly power
on chicken farmers by talking to
them directly.
She teamed up with the DOJ to
collect information directly from the
public about how mergers have
worked in the time of online
platforms like Facebook or Amazon or
Uber.
So we got a lot of input.
We did a bunch of listening sessions
with farmers, with nurses, with
health care workers more generally,
with journalists, with musicians,
really with people across the
economy to understand on the
ground, what has it looked like
when you've seen mergers in your
sector and what have the real
world effects been?
You know, we got thousands and
thousands of comments, a lot of
them from workers who had noted,
for example, the ways in which
mergers that have gone through
have ended up resulting in their
pay being cut, their work
schedules becoming less
predictable, their working
conditions becoming worse.
We heard from, you know, small
businesses, independent businesses
about how mergers have resulted
in them being muscled out of
markets, not because they can't
compete, not because customers
don't want their products, but
because firms that have merged
have been able to use their
muscle to bully firms and push
them out.
And so there are revisions that
we put forward this summer, for
example, address platform markets.
For the first time ever, they
address labor markets.
They make clear that the agencies
are going to look at how mergers
could potentially limit
competition, not just in ways
that will harm consumers, but
also in ways that could harm
workers and labor.
The FTC and DOJ put out a
draft of the new merger
guidelines this summer, and
they give you a sense of how
Lina is exploring broader types
of harm than many of her
predecessors.
The FTC is now looking not
just at how consumers might be
harmed by a merger, by, you
know, higher prices or less
product variety, but also at
how a merger might affect, you
know, workers.
And in speeches and articles,
she's also talked about harm to
digital security, harm to
privacy.
But the merger guidelines are
only one tool she has to
change the way companies
behave.
For this agenda to have any
real teeth, it comes down to
filing actual lawsuits against
companies that Lina Khan and
the FTC allege have broken
antitrust law.
And with those lawsuits, she's
taken some pretty big swings.
We asked Lina to walk us
through four of those
lawsuits.
The first one was a case the FTC
refiled against Facebook,
arguing that some high-profile
acquisitions from the last
decade or so shouldn't have
been allowed.
And one of the claims there
was that Facebook had become
dominant on the desktop
market.
And then they quickly saw that
the market at a later stage
was shifting to mobile, and
they saw that firms like
Instagram and WhatsApp instead
were threatening to become more
dominant in the mobile space
and make Facebook irrelevant.
And so we allege Facebook made
those acquisitions of
Instagram and WhatsApp because
it viewed them as a threat in
the mobile market.
The FTC is arguing that the
courts should unwind the
deal, force Facebook to divest
itself of WhatsApp and
Instagram.
We reached out to Facebook's
parent company Meta for
comment, and they referred us
to a previous statement in
which they say, quote,
Our investments in Instagram
and WhatsApp transformed them
into what they are today.
They've been good for
competition and good for the
people and businesses that
choose to use our products.
The court has not yet made a
decision on this case.
The FTC's lawsuit is still
pending.
But the case shows how
Lina Khan and the FTC are
now thinking about why it's
so important to stop
anticompetitive acquisitions
earlier in the process.
The idea is that if
regulators aren't paying
close enough attention to
emerging markets, especially
in tech, huge dominant
firms can just buy up any
would-be rivals and scuttle
that market before it ever
really gets going.
These technological inflection
points can be really
important moments of new
competition.
And so the incumbents
oftentimes feel threatened
during these moments.
And so we want to be making
sure that we're not allowing
dominant monopolies today
to also solidify their
monopoly power in tomorrow's
markets through these
acquisitions.
And this is the underlying
philosophy that's also
motivating the second lawsuit
we're going to talk about.
Another case the FTC brought
against Facebook, this one
after it had been rebranded
to Metta.
Metta was trying to require
a virtual reality company
called Within Unlimited.
And even though that VR
market was still in its
tiniest infancy, the FTC
argued that Metta's
behavior was still
anticompetitive because it
preempted competition that
might otherwise bloom in
the virtual reality space.
And so Lina and the FTC
used an old legal theory
that hadn't been used
much for decades, since
basically before the whole
backlash against aggressive
antitrust enforcement.
So the FTC's case seeking
to block Metta's acquisition
of Within was really
about what's known as
potential competition.
And so the claims in
the case included noting
that Metta itself had
actually been planning to
enter this market itself
and then ended up doing
this acquisition in ways
that short-circuited that
organic competition that
we would have seen if
Metta had organically
looked to enter.
And so that was one of
the counts. We also noted
that just the mere fact
that Metta was potentially
going to enter also ended
up disciplining the existing
players in the VR market.
Now, in the case of Metta
within Unlimited, the
courts decided not to block
that acquisition.
Tell me a little bit about
what happened in the
decision and what lessons
you're taking from that.
So look, we only bring
cases where we believe
there's a law violation
and our team did a
terrific job putting
together that case in a
very compressed period of
time. It's true we, you
know, we did not win and
we were disappointed by
that, but the court's
decision also had a whole
set of really important
determinations about how
this potential competition
doctrine applies in
digital markets. So in
the case, you know,
one of Facebook's
argument was that this
doctrine is so old it
doesn't even apply to
these markets. And the
court firmly rejected
that. He said, no, this
potential competition
doctrine is alive and
well, even in markets
like digital markets, even
relating to virtual
reality. And he noted
a whole set of important
ways that that doctrine
applies in this market
and gave us a whole set
of wins that we can
build on in any future
cases. But of course,
anytime we have setbacks
in the court, we look
closely at those opinions
and try to figure out
what we do better.
According to the court,
the argument the FTC
made in this case was,
quote, impermissibly
speculative. But the
court did accept
potential competition as
a valid argument in
theory. And Lena sees
that as a kind of win.
Another one of her big
swings, the FTC's
attempt to block what
are called vertical
mergers. That's when
companies buy up other
companies in their
industry that they don't
directly compete with,
like a car company
buying a smaller tire
manufacturer, for
example. Under recent
mainstream interpretations
of antitrust law,
vertical mergers are
generally seen as OK.
They're not seen as
anti-competitive. They're
even seen as a way to
improve efficiency,
which, you know, is good
for consumers. But Lena
Kahn argues those mergers
can come at a big cost.
They can give a company
too much power in an
industry. And you can
see this argument
playing out in case
number three, the FTC's
attempt to block
Microsoft from acquiring
a video game company
called Activision
Blizzard.
Microsoft and Activision
Blizzard, they aren't
direct competitors.
Not exactly.
Microsoft makes the
popular gaming console
the Xbox, while
Activision Blizzard
makes games. But the
FTC's case argued
that this merger could
allow Microsoft to
starve other video
game platforms like
the PlayStation from
getting access to big
Activision games like,
you know, Call of Duty.
We've generally had a
market where you could
have platform agnostic
content developers that
are able to reach
video gamers through a
whole set of platforms.
And there's a risk that
if this acquisition goes
through, we'll instead
see a shift to a
series of walled
gardens that will make
it much more difficult
for organic content
to be getting to
video game users.
But the courts decided
again in this case
against the FTC.
They let Microsoft's
vertical merger go
through, saying the FTC
hadn't proven the
deal would hurt consumers.
Though the FTC is still
pursuing a case post
merger.
This leads us to the
fourth and final case
that Lena walked us
through, the one that
many people across the
world of antitrust had
been waiting for for
years. This fall, the
FTC brought a case
against the subject of
her famous law school
paper against Amazon.
But the crux of the
FTC's case against
Amazon rests on more
conventional antitrust
arguments about consumer
welfare, that Amazon
had had a policy that
harmed its third party
sellers, which
ultimately had harmed
consumers.
So our lawsuit lays
out how Amazon is,
for example, harming
the millions of merchants
that rely on Amazon
to access consumers.
In today's digital
economy, if you want
to be visible in
e-commerce, you generally
have to sell on Amazon.
And the lawsuit lays
out a set of tactics
that Amazon has deployed
against those merchants
that we believe are
anti-competitive.
It has basically
dictated policies that
say, if you sell on
Amazon, you can't list
your products on any
other website for a
price that's lower than
what you're listing on
Amazon.
And one reason that ends
up being problematic is
because Amazon has also
been hiking the fees
that it charges these
merchants.
So these merchants face
higher costs on Amazon,
but are not able to
raise their price on
Amazon to reflect those
higher costs, and instead
they have to either
raise their price on
other websites, or they
just stop selling
anywhere else entirely
because Amazon is so
punitive when it does
see that people have
listed their products
elsewhere for a lower
price.
And so at the end of
the day, Amazon's
tactics are actually
resulting in higher
prices, not just on
Amazon, but across the
rest of the economy.
And if you step back,
you know, in a healthy
competitive market, if
you have a company
that's raising prices for
its customers and making
the service worse, you
should expect competition,
right? It creates an
opening for new
businesses to come in and
take business away from
that incumbent.
But we really haven't
seen that successfully in
this market, and we
allege that's in part
because Amazon has
engaged in illegal
tactics to block rivals,
and so it's able to harm
its customers without
really paying the price
that it should in a
competitive market.
One thing that a lot of
people have pointed out
about this case is that
it's not exactly the
same prescription you
called for in your
famous law school
paper, you know, that
kind of frames the
harm on terms that are
familiar to the
consumer welfare
standard way of thinking
about monopoly power.
Help us understand how
your kind of thinking
and strategy has changed
between the time that
you wrote that paper and
now what you're
bringing as chair of the
FTC.
I mean, I'll say as a
general matter, the
exercise of doing
independent research and
writing an academic
paper is very different
from being a law
enforcer where you
have subpoena power,
you can investigate what's
really going on, and
ultimately you're charged
with, if you bring a
complaint, making sure
you're alleging law
violations and setting
up that case to succeed
in court.
That said, I'll also
note that when you
have the monopoly
playbook, there are
different life cycles
of where you can be at
any given moment, and
the tactics that a
firm will take to
achieve monopoly power
to become a monopoly
will look different from
the tactics that it
deploys once it's become
a monopoly and is
really focused on
protecting that monopoly
and exploiting that
monopoly power.
And so the case that
we brought really
reflects Amazon in
the year 2023, and
what we believe is
now extraction mode.
We're having cemented
its monopoly power,
having locked out
rivals through this
illegal tactics, it's
able to extract from
customers, both on
the consumer side as
well on the seller
side. And so that's
what the case is about.
If enforcers had
investigated and
decided to bring a
case a decade ago,
there's no doubt that
the set of tactics
that would have been
a focus there would
have looked different.
We reached out to
Amazon for comment
and they referred us
to a statement released
when the FTC filed
its case. They called
it a misguided
lawsuit and said
that if the case
were successful, it
would, quote, force
Amazon to engage in
practices that actually
harm consumers and
the many businesses
that sell in our store.
Lena Kahn says this
case is just getting
started. It might
take years to battle
it out in the courts.
But she does say that
asking a judge to
potentially break up
Amazon is still on
the table. As for
her larger strategy
of taking on
ambitious cases and
trying out novel
legal doctrines.
Seems like a number
of critics argue
that these last few
cases that were lost,
that they're a sign
that you may be pushing
anti-trust enforcement
beyond the boundaries
of the actual law.
Like, how do you
respond to that critique?
So we're absolutely
dead focused on
making sure we are
fully being faithful
to the laws that
Congress passed and
the legal precedent
on the books.
And, you know,
we've had a whole
set of successes.
We've probably been
successful in around
20 merger cases,
where after we filed
a complaint, the
companies walked away
or after we did
an investigation, the
companies folded.
That includes in the
context of two really
major vertical mergers.
This was Lockheed's
attempted acquisition
of Aerojet,
NVIDIA's attempted
acquisition of Arm.
Blockbuster deals,
known as vertical deals,
which have historically
been seen as more
difficult to challenge.
Companies walked away
after the FTC filed its suit.
So obviously the
setbacks that we've had,
we've been disappointed by.
We've kind of looked
closely at what we can
learn from them
and do better.
And ultimately we
carry the burden
of explaining to the courts
and persuading them
about how these
long-term antitrust
principles apply in some
of these newer markets.
But as a law enforcer,
one of the things
that I think most
about is deterrence.
You really want to
ensure that firms
are not engaging
in illegal behavior
in the first instance.
And one set of comments
that have really
been promising for us
is hearing from
prominent dealmakers,
prominent bankers
who will say
a few years back
when I was part of
conversations about
whether to do a merger,
we never really talked
about antitrust until the very,
very, very end, if at all.
And now that's totally different.
We talk about antitrust on day one
and there are a whole bunch of deals
that are not even happening
because there's a recognition
that they would be legally suspect
from an antitrust point of view.
So as an enforcer,
that deterrence is a huge
marker of success, right?
We want to be making sure
we're conserving our resources
that firms are not
engaging in illegal
mergers in the first instance.
And there are a whole set
of indications that that's happening.
Lina Khan, chair of the FTC.
Thank you so much
for chatting with us.
Thanks for having me.
On the next Planet Money,
the Luddites famously
smashed machines to pieces.
So when I heard that
the author of a new Luddite book
had never himself
smashed even one single machine,
I knew what to do.
Call out the names
of some of these machines
as you do it in between.
On the next Planet Money,
we dare writers and researchers
to do things they've never done before,
to learn about the
economic world around us.
