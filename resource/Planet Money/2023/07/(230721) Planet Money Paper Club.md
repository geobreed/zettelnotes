We here at Planet Money love economics papers. And that is also the case for so many of the economists we speak with. For them, new research can explain something they have always wondered about, or make them see something they have never noticed before. And it inspires their own work.

So, to bring that same sense of discovery to you, the listener, today we are dedicating our show to a special experiment. A new way to share some of the most fascinating, clever and surprising economics papers in a segment we're calling: The Econ Paper Club.

On today's show, we read the econ papers so you don't have to. We take a joyous romp through some of the most fascinating ideas floating around economics right now. And we find that some of those fascinating ideas are about some of the biggest things in life: the careers we choose, the expectations that come with parenting and what one eminent economist calls 'greedy jobs.'

This episode was hosted by Erika Beras and Kenny Malone. It was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler and James Sneed. It was edited by Molly Messick. It was fact-checked by Sierra Juarez, and engineered by Robert Rodriguez. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer.

KENNY MALONE, BYLINE: Just a heads up - this episode mentions the company LinkedIn, which has been a sponsor of NPR.

ERIKA BERAS, HOST:

This is PLANET MONEY from NPR.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, "WAKING UP TO THE FIRE")

BERAS: We here at PLANET MONEY read econ papers, a lot of them.

MALONE: A lot of them - because buried in those figures and charts and Greek letter-y formulas are incredible observations about our world.

BERAS: Yes. And once you learn to read econ papers, it's like you've learned a secret code that unlocks all of these insights and explanations about why things work the way they do.

MALONE: Yeah. It's why we love econ papers. And we thought, you know how other people have book clubs? Well, PLANET MONEY should have an econ paper club.

BERAS: Ooh.

MALONE: So we're going to try something new and very special today - a way to share some of the most fascinating, clever, surprising economics papers in a hopefully recurring segment we are calling the Econ Paper Club.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Hello and welcome to Planet Money. I'm Kenny Malone.

BERAS: And I'm Erika Beras. And also hello and welcome to the inaugural PLANET MONEY Econ Paper Club.

MALONE: We're trying hard to make it work and make it work over and over. Today on the show, we read the econ papers so you don't have to. We're going to take you on a joyous romp through some fascinating ideas floating around economics right now.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MALONE: Last year, thousands of school principals all got the exact same email from the exact same parents with the exact same subject line, which was school inquiry.

BERAS: Now, was this a real school inquiry?

MALONE: No.

BERAS: Were these real parents?

MALONE: No.

BERAS: Nope. It was some very clever economists running an experiment.

MALONE: Yeah. And that experiment - that is the subject of the first econ paper we're going to discuss for Econ Paper Club. And, here, let us just explain how this, like, pretty fun, sneaky little experiment worked.

BERAS: Right. OK. So all these principals were sent that email - school inquiry.

MALONE: Yeah. And then in the body of the email, it said, dear principal so-and-so, we are searching for schools for our child. Can you call one of us to discuss? And then the email listed the names of these two parents - parent No. 1, Roy (ph), with Roy's phone number, parent No. 2, Erica (ph), with Erica's phone number.

BERAS: And if it's not clear yet where this study is going, the idea was to test which of these two parents - who are fictional, by the way, totally made up - which of them these schools would choose to call back.

MALONE: Right. Would the schools call the presumed mother, Erica, or the presumed father, Roy? And, you know, to be extra safe, the people running this experiment tried variations on the email as well. They switched up the names, the order of the names.

BERAS: Almost 6,000 schools got the email. Twelve hundred called back. And what this experiment found was that Erica, the mom in this fictional scenario, was 40% more likely to get that phone call - 40%.

MALONE: And I felt this study so much because I am often the primary contact for my child, and yet the school will completely ignore me when there's something to get in touch with me about, just call my wife, and it's really gratifying to see actual numbers and actual data about this phenomenon.

BERAS: Another reason we love this study - it has an incredible, "Ghostbusters"-inspired title...

MALONE: It does.

BERAS: ...Which is, quote...

(SOUNDBITE OF RAY PARKER JR. SONG, "GHOSTBUSTERS")

BERAS: "Who You Gonna Call? Gender Inequality In External Demands For Parental Involvement."

MALONE: Incredible title.

BERAS: It's really good.

MALONE: And a funny thing happened when we tried to call one of the paper's authors. This was an economist at Tufts named Laura Gee. And when we first called, she apparently didn't recognize our phone number, but she later explained how she was in a very relatable situation where she felt like she had to answer our unknown number.

LAURA GEE: It's summer, so my child is at a camp. And I thought, oh, well, usually, I don't like to pick up random phone calls, but it might be camp, and I might need to go pick up my kid because something's gone wrong.

BERAS: So this study is, like, it's not unrelated to your life.

GEE: No. This study is a study that was born of both my interest in labor markets as an economist and my interest in being angsty about always getting called instead of my male spouse. In fact, my husband is literally the vice president of my child's PTA at her school.

BERAS: Of course.

GEE: I do not know why he does not get the first call when something is going wrong.

MALONE: This particular study - it was limited to two-parent heterosexual households. And it would be great to also see how this would play out with other kinds of households because, you know, who a school calls, it sounds like a small thing. But clearly, Laura and the other authors were getting at something much bigger with their study.

GEE: You know, this really has to affect the way that women and men interact with the workforce and the choices they make in a way that's not great for fully utilizing women as workers and being productive parts of the workforce.

BERAS: Yeah, like those phone calls. They interrupt the workday, and they are effectively telling the mom, you should be the one to come pick up the sick kid. And so the study is really looking at how one seemingly small thing in the world, an external expectation by other people - how even that might have a role in gender inequality.

MALONE: OK, so the who-you-going-to-call paper, the first paper of Econ Paper Club. But what will be the next paper of our paper club, Erica?

BERAS: Well, Kenny, we had an idea. What if we do, like, a pay-it-forward recommendation chain? We're going to ask Laura what paper she really wants to talk about.

I want to know, what is a study that you are a fan of right now?

GEE: So I am a huge fan of this paper by Yana Gallen and Melanie Wasserman. Apologies if I have mispronounced anyone's name there. I don't know either of them very well. And it's called "Informed Choices: Gender Gaps In Career Advice."

BERAS: OK, a paper from a similar area.

MALONE: Yeah. So this is a recent study that is interested in whether or not gender affects the kind of career advice somebody gets.

GEE: I think that's why this is so cool, is it's thinking about a step in the pipeline of career progression that I just hadn't actually thought very carefully about. But then as soon as they showed it to me, I can't not think about it anymore.

BERAS: Can't not think about how people get pointed towards different kinds of careers according to gender.

MALONE: Yeah. And here is how this paper studied that. So the authors had real college students use their real accounts on a real online professional networking platform, which the authors do not say is LinkedIn but certainly sounds like LinkedIn to me. I don't know what else it would be.

BERAS: Totally, totally sounds like LinkedIn. And the detail we really love is that the authors wanted to keep the students' profiles as uniform as possible.

MALONE: So all these students had to make their, you know, probably LinkedIn profiles really basic - just, like, first name, last initial, college major, that kind of stuff.

BERAS: And the best part, as the study explains, quote, "we provided students with the same photo of an iconic university building to use as a profile picture," meaning they all had to replace their face with a picture of the same building.

MALONE: It's a super normal thing to do, and it means that it must have looked like the weirdest, like, social media movement ever. Are these econ students pro this building? - anti this building? No. No, no. It's just a sneaky study about career advice. That's what's happening.

BERAS: That's right. And these students all sent messages to professionals in a few fields like finance and law and data science. And they asked the professionals from those fields about their jobs - how challenging they are, how rewarding they are, that kind of thing.

MALONE: And when the researchers collected all of the career information and advice that came back from the professionals, here's what they found. So when a student requesting advice had a traditionally female name, that person was considerably more likely to get advice like warning them about long hours or grueling career paths. The students with traditionally male-sounding names - those people did not hear nearly as much warning.

BERAS: In other words, men and women who are studying the exact same thing may get pointed towards different careers based on the assumption that the women will need more flexibility for family.

MALONE: And when Laura Gee, the economist who recommended this for Econ Paper Club, read this study, it really, really struck a chord with her.

BERAS: Why did you pick this particular paper?

GEE: Not only was I very impressed with it just in terms of, you know, just the data and the analysis and the work that went into it, but it also made me change the way I behave in the world, which is not always true for when I read a paper.

BERAS: Because, Laura says, she read that paper and thought, oh, no, I am totally guilty of this, too, when I advise female students.

MALONE: And so Laura told us that she and her colleagues will now, like, check each other if maybe, say, a couple of professors are meeting with a student about a job search or something.

GEE: Sometimes after collective meetings we'll be, like, hey, afterwards, I don't know if you noticed, but you kind of, like, pushed really hard on what that was going to be like for somebody who has children, and, like, do we know that this person intends to have children or...

BERAS: Interesting.

GEE: ...How they want to be involved in their child's life? And so, you know, we'll just sort of, like, take a moment to be like, let's assess, was that advice that we gave from our perspective without considering what the person who - actually wanted?

MALONE: Laura told us that she didn't really know any of the authors on this career-advice study. And so we asked her, like, hey, is there anything that you would want to say to the authors?

GEE: That I love this work. I think it is incredibly innovative and well done, and it's a really important problem.

YANA GALLEN: Thank you. I love your work too, Laura, if you're listening.

BERAS: This is Yana Gallen, labor economist at the University of Chicago. She was co-author of that career-advice paper.

MALONE: And Yana says, looking back, she can totally see how this career advice stuff played out for her when she was looking for jobs and getting her own career advice.

GALLEN: My husband is an economist, too, and when I was on the job market, in most of the interviews - so you have, like, these 30-minute meetings with a bunch of different faculty kind of all day long. That's what the interview is. And I talked so much about child care availability and, like, how nice living in the city is and what the amenities are and not about economics. And I don't think that was the case for him. We talked about like, you know, oh, you're working on this and blah, blah, blah.

BERAS: Yana says it's complicated because, obviously, these kind of lifestyle things matter a lot when you're choosing a career. But also, undergrads don't necessarily know or care how much family or lifestyle is going to matter in 10 or 20 years.

MALONE: OK. So Yana's paper - that is Econ Paper Club paper No. 2. And for our next paper, we wanted to keep this, you know, pay-it-forward recommendation chain going. And so we asked Yana.

BERAS: What is a paper that you have read recently that you are loving right now?

GALLEN: Yeah. So I love this paper by Ilyana Kuziemko, Jessica Pan, Jenny Shen and Ebonya Washington called "The Mommy Effect."

BERAS: Yes, "The Mommy Effect." And to be clear, we told these economists they could recommend papers from any area of study. But, hey, if the first edition of Econ Paper Club has a theme, so be it.

MALONE: Yeah. It's great. We get a glimpse of what some cutting-edge researchers are geeking out about. And, you know, honestly, even though the paper Yana recommends here is called "The Mommy Effect," it does get at this much bigger thing that may apply to anybody as they figure out their career path.

GALLEN: So I think what's exciting about the paper is that they're highlighting like, you know, there's a lot of dissonance here between, you know, what people expect and what they realize. And it seems like actually maybe their opinions change.

MALONE: OK. So this paper's full name is "The Mommy Effect: Do Women Anticipate The Employment Effects Of Motherhood?" It is a working paper. It's been around for a few years now.

BERAS: Yep. All the papers we've mentioned here are working papers. That's how it works in economics. Papers are presented at conferences, and they can get press coverage before they're formally published.

MALONE: So this "Mommy Effect" paper that Yana wanted to talk about, it's what the researchers called a collage of empirical evidence, which basically means that they were taking all kinds of existing surveys - in this case, from the U.S. and the U.K. - and then layering those surveys together to ask all of that data a new question.

BERAS: And the question in this case was, when women think about having children, how accurately do they predict the impact on their career?

GALLEN: I think it's a fantastic paper because it's kind of the first one I know of that thinks about people as not really planning correctly or being able to plan accurately for this huge thing that happens in your life, which is like - having a child, kind of a transformative experience.

BERAS: According to the paper, the thing people don't plan correctly for is parenthood, specifically motherhood.

MALONE: Yeah. And also, anecdotally, very hard to plan for fatherhood, but that is not what this study is about.

BERAS: Not what it's about.

MALONE: It is specifically about motherhood.

BERAS: And the study found that women, especially educated women, don't anticipate the costs that come along with motherhood, the many ways it's difficult to balance work and parenthood, as well as the literal cost of child care. And so they wind up forming a more negative view of employment. And there are large and significant numbers of women who leave the workforce at that point in their careers. Women are 30 percentage points less likely to still be working within a year of having a child.

MALONE: Now, Yana is a labor economist, and she says that in labor economics, they're constantly using statistical models to predict how people will act in different employment situations. And one of the reasons that she loves this paper is because she says the models just sort of assume that everybody's preferences are constant.

BERAS: But they're not. This paper shows that women may enter the labor market and then rearrange their priorities when they have a family. And Yana says that's the kind of thing her field should probably take into account.

GALLEN: How should we be modeling this huge life event that impacts your labor market earnings for a long time after the child is born doesn't seem to necessarily be anticipated. And that is not something that's in the models right now, but it might explain a lot of the labor market patterns that we have.

MALONE: So this is the place where we would call the author of the "Mommy Effect" paper and continue our little pay-it-forward paper recommendation chain.

BERAS: But when I reached out to one of the authors, she told me that she couldn't talk because she was dealing with a child who had hand, foot and mouth disease. Of course. Yeah, very on theme for this episode.

MALONE: Yeah. It is a rite of parental passage. It is miserable. It also left us with a small problem, which is our Econ Paper Club, like, paper chain was broken. Erika and I were trying to figure out, how would we find a final paper to talk about for this episode?

BERAS: And then as we look back through the three papers we'd already talked about, we realized there was a final recommendation hidden in all of these papers. Everyone cites the work of the same economist.

MALONE: And that economist joins us after the break.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

BERAS: Tell me who you are and what you do. And how do you describe what you study?

CLAUDIA GOLDIN: I am Claudia Goldin. I am a professor of economics at Harvard University, and I am an economic historian.

MALONE: Claudia Goldin is a legend - first woman tenured in economics at Harvard, former president of the big-deal econ group, the American Economic Association.

BERAS: But you'll get a simpler answer when you ask Claudia to describe her work.

GOLDIN: I think of myself as a detective. There are lots of questions, and I try to answer them.

BERAS: And some of those questions happen to have been about motherhood and the economy, which is why her work was cited in all of the papers we've talked about today.

MALONE: Now, Claudia has written so many papers that it is almost ridiculous to try and talk about just one, which is why, in the inaugural PLANET MONEY Econ Paper Club, we are already kind of cheating because our final...

BERAS: Kind of. Just a little.

MALONE: ...Paper today is Claudia Goldin's book. It's not a paper. It's a book.

BERAS: It's a book. It's a book. And that book is called "Career And Family: Women's Century-Long Journey Toward Equity." And in that book is this really useful idea that we wanted to talk with Claudia about - something that she calls greedy jobs.

GOLDIN: If you have jobs that are greedy jobs, part of that greediness is you are expected to go to Tokyo every other weekend or to go to Zurich every month to sign contracts, to do a handshake, to get to know someone, to look them in the eye.

MALONE: Yeah. Yeah. You know a greedy job when you see one - a job that asks so much of you. It wants you to give it every part of your life, every hour - unpredictable schedule.

BERAS: And greedy jobs don't just take a lot of time. As Claudia describes them, they're jobs that incentivize more and more work. So if you work twice as much, you're putting in all these hours, maybe you might earn 10 times more.

MALONE: And there are plenty of couples that start out as equals, plugging away at their own greedy jobs. Each of them has one. But Claudia says, if a child enters the picture, there is usually this moment where that couple stops, does the math and realizes that it is going to be hard for both people to keep their greedy jobs.

BERAS: Claudia specifically studied how this has played out for lawyers - notoriously greedy jobs. Right around the time children enter the picture, 2% of male lawyers go part-time. Two percent leave the labor force altogether.

MALONE: Just 2%, only 2%, compared to 25% of lawyers who are women go part-time, and 16% leave the labor force altogether.

BERAS: And those decisions can have a huge impact. In law, going part-time could take someone off of the lucrative partner track completely.

MALONE: Yeah. But Claudia says it doesn't have to be this way.

GOLDIN: If you can take the greedy jobs and make them more flexible, then you will go some of the distance that would eradicate some of the gender wage gaps even if you still had many of the nasty social norms that surround us.

MALONE: Claudia says there are examples of less-greedy but still lucrative jobs. And she likes to point to pharmacists for a bunch of reasons, really.

BERAS: Right. And one reason is that being a pharmacist is this specialized job where people are able to substitute easily for one another. They generally work as a team, taking shifts, swapping in and out, making themselves interchangeable.

MALONE: And when you look at pharmacist pay, you can see that when somebody does decide to go part-time, they aren't financially penalized like they would be in a greedy job.

BERAS: And when we were talking to Claudia about this, she said, of course you can make jobs more flexible. But overcoming the nasty social norms - her words - that's the more gradual process.

GOLDIN: There are many workplaces still in which - and many families in which switching gender roles is difficult, that the norm surrounding you - and this is exactly the paper that you began your journey with - whom do you call? - because that school nurse always calls the mother.

BERAS: You know, all the economists we talked to before Claudia - interestingly, they're each at that critical moment in life that Claudia's written so much about - mid-career, young kids, figuring out what working with a family can look like. And when we started this paper recommendation chain, we really did say, you can recommend papers about anything you want in any subject at all. And instead, all of these economists recommended papers that were grappling in some way with this really important and personal economic moment - when a career and a family collide. And you could feel how excited these women were not just that this research is happening, but that it's about things they've experienced in their own lives.

MALONE: Yeah, totally. And you sort of get this sense of this next generation of economists gaining momentum, taking shape. And it's a generation that has been reading and inspired by Claudia Goldin's research - literally citing it in their own research. And Claudia wanted us to know that she's been reading and inspired by their work as well.

GOLDIN: I think that the people whose work you're citing are in the trenches, and they're doing incredibly good work, and I am very impressed and happy that they're doing it. And I use their work.

MALONE: Today's show was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler and James Sneed. It was edited by Molly Messick and fact-checked by Sierra Juarez. It was engineered by Robert Rodriguez. Alex Goldmark is our executive producer.

BERAS: Thank you to the co-authors and authors of the papers we talked about in this show - Kristy Buzard, Olga Stoddard, Melanie Wasserman, Ilyana Kuziemko, Jessica Pan, Jenny Shen and Ebonya Washington.

MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone.

BERAS: And I'm Erika Beras. This is NPR. Thanks for listening.

The Republican National Convention is happening this week and the NPR Politics Podcast takes
you there.
We're on the ground in Milwaukee with analysis, recaps, and coverage of what happens every
night of the RNC.
Listen to the NPR Politics Podcast.
Thanks for listening to Planet Money Summer School.
Here you can binge every semester with classes on the economics of dating, 401Ks,
and why bankruptcy is a secret weapon of the American economy.
But Planet Money is much more than just a summertime treat.
In our regular podcast feed, you'll hear in-depth stories about the role money plays
in our lives twice a week, all year round.
Just search Planet Money.
And for a daily dose of bite-sized econ news, check out our other podcast, The Indicator.
This is Planet Money from NPR.
That bell can only mean one thing.
It's time for Planet Money Summer School.
Whenever the temperature rises and the beach beckons, we show up with a batch
of easy lessons to make those lazy afternoons a wee bit more productive.
In summer's past, Planet Money Summer School has taught us to think like an economist
and invest like a boss.
This year, I think we're ready for graduate school.
Oh yeah, a master's in business administration, an MBA the easy way.
I should trademark that.
I'm your host, Robert Smith.
Now some might be thinking, Robert, I don't want to spend my precious summer doing hostile
takeovers of underperforming businesses.
I want to fire up my barbecue, not fire all my workers.
Why do I need a cut-rate MBA?
Once upon a time, I thought the same thing.
I'm a reporter.
I teach journalism at Columbia, and yet I got an MBA.
And I found that what business school does is very similar to our jobs here at Planet
Money.
We try to understand the nuts and bolts of how a business works, the principles that
drive this fierce competition for our attention and our dollars.
And business schools even use a very Planet Money method in their classes.
They read case studies, little stories about someone trying to start a business, their
challenges, and the decisions they make.
Our season will work the same way.
We'll play classic Planet Money episodes as case studies.
We'll hear from business geniuses.
The most insulting thing we hear is when someone says you're a natural born salesman.
Well, screw you.
I spent a lot of time and effort to learn how to do this properly.
Fierce competitors.
Oh, you're going to make all of that stuff for $15?
Damn.
And expert negotiators.
You know, the real trick to bargaining is get the other side to bargaining against
themselves.
You just lay back and let them do all the work.
And then we'll bring in a fancy pants business school professor to give us the
fundamental principles we can all use in our lives.
Accounting is your superpower.
In today's class, we will start our MBA degree from square one.
What are the very first steps someone needs to know when starting a business?
Our professor is Angela Lee from Columbia Business School.
She's been an entrepreneur.
She teaches future entrepreneurs, and she runs a venture capital firm, 37 Angels.
That means she's been pitched 20,000 business ideas and invested in about 100 of them.
So I've been pitched everywhere.
I've been pitched in the restroom.
I've been pitched in line at the grocery store.
I was once pitched in a restaurant by somebody who was sitting at the table next to me because
they realized who I was.
I admit it.
I was totally going to pitch you my million dollar business idea.
But instead, let's just talk about starting a business.
We always think of entrepreneurs as these lone geniuses who break all the rules.
But can you actually learn the rules of starting a business?
I think you can really learn what not to do in terms of starting a business.
I think you can learn, don't use this social media channel to acquire customers, or don't
use this subject line in your email.
And I think that can save you a lot of time, save you a lot of bashing your head
against a wall.
Cautionary tales.
Absolutely.
Well, we will listen to two, well, I will call them cautionary tales.
They're interesting tales, and maybe we can talk about the principles that we can learn
from them afterwards.
Sounds great.
Okay, our two case studies today feature people starting new businesses in the most
challenging conditions you can think of.
And if they can do it, you can do it too.
After the break.
Here at Shortwave Space Camp, we escape our everyday lives to explore the mysteries
and quirks of the universe.
We find weird, fun, interesting stories that explain how the cosmos is partying
all around us.
From stars to dwarf planets to black holes and beyond, we've got you.
Listen now to the Shortwave podcast from NPR.
The NPR app cuts through the noise, bringing you local, national and global coverage.

On this week's episode of Wildcard, actor and reading rainbow host LaVar Burton says
he knows people see him in a certain way.
It is hard to imagine you getting really angry about something.
Oh my God, you could not be more wrong.
I'm Rachel Martin.
Join us for NPR's Wildcard podcast, the game where cards control the conversation.
Hey, everyone.
Before we get back to summer school, a quick plug for our most recent bonus episode.
I share five things I learned at business school that were totally new to me, even
after all my years of working at Planet Money.
Here's a context free spoiler.
One of those things is called the death spiral and it's accounting.
Also in that episode, we have a new exciting businessy way that listeners
will get a chance to be in an episode of summer school this year.
And if you're a Planet Money Plus supporter, you can hear the details first.
And if you're not a supporter, you could be.
Give it a try at plus dot NPR dot O.R.G.
All right, back to the show.
Welcome back to Planet Money Summer School.
We wanted to start our MBA class with a story about how ideas for new
businesses can be found in the places you least expect.
As you listen to this case study, think about where entrepreneurs get their
ideas from and how they test out those ideas to see if anyone
wants to actually pay for it.
This story originally aired on Planet Money in 2015, hosted by me and Steve Head.
Frederick Hudson had this entrepreneurial itch pretty much from the day he was born.
In high school, he had a lawn mowing business where he got other kids
to actually mow the lawns.
He did the same thing with a car washing business.
The guy was a natural.
He went to the Air Force, moved to Las Vegas, started a window tinting
business, and then he bought a mailing center, one of those off-brand
UPS kind of stores in Las Vegas.
And this store was key to his biggest business plan yet.
He was going to deliver marijuana all over the country using UPS and FedEx.
What could go wrong?
What could go wrong?
I'm at the mail center and I'm just sitting behind the counter.
And then I see it's like all glass.
And then I see agents coming from both sides, about 12 people from both
sides, and they just all like rushed the door like with guns drawn.
Frederick got nailed for conspiracy to distribute marijuana.
Five years, federal prison.
Now, some guys go to prison and they find religion.
Some guys go to prison and they work out a lot, get massive biceps.
But remember, Frederick Hudson was the businessman.
So he would spend all of his time in the prison library writing business plans.
So I just spent every day writing random whatever I did, even if it
wasn't even possible or feasible, I would just write a plan for it.
I would write how I want to build it.
I would write who I want to hire.
I met white collar guys and they showed me how to write financial models.
And we would get paper, tape them together, white paper like that,
get rulers and draw lines and make a spreadsheet with my hand.
Like physical paper spreadsheets.
Right, right.
Yeah, right.
So it was a tedious process, but I had time to do it.
He was doing what entrepreneurs do, right?
He'd pick a problem and figure out a solution.
But as the days went on, Frederick realized the biggest problems that needed
solving were actually all around him, inside this jail.
Yeah, the first thing you notice in prison is there is no competition.
If you want to buy soap, there is only one place to get it,
the prison commissary, and it is way overpriced.
And Frederick says that's nothing compared to the pay phones.
I mean, those guys can charge whatever they want.
Basically, when I was in the county jail, I was making calls out, but
it was expensive.
It was getting to the point where Tanya, who was my girlfriend at the time,
she was like, I can't afford it.
Every time you call me, it's $50.
So I stopped calling as much.
Wait, every time you called her, it was $50?
How long were you talking?
Right, we was talking, I think the calls were like 15 minutes.
And the reason why it cost 15 minutes.
15 minutes for $50.
Right, it was very expensive.
The phones are a drag, but the thing that really drove Frederick nuts
was this photo problem.
He wanted his girlfriend to send him a photo.
But inmates aren't allowed to have cell phones or internet access.
So for his girlfriend to actually send him her picture, she'd have to go and
print it out at a drug store, put it in an envelope, and mail it to the prison.
And that didn't happen.
Frederick lies there on his bunk mulling over this problem.
And then he goes to the library with his blank pieces of paper and pencils.
And he starts thinking about the photo problem like a businessman.
What if there were a company that could make this whole photo thing easier?
A website or an app, some technology that would allow someone to take
a picture, hit a button, and then poof, that printed photo would automatically get
sent by mail to prison.
So this whole idea basically started because you wanted to get pictures from
your girlfriend, right?
Right.
Forget pot delivery.
This was going to be his perfectly legal million dollar idea.
He even came up with a name for it, a kind of 2010 name, Picturegram.
Picturegram.
Now, there wasn't much he could do about building Picturegram while he was
still behind bars.
But when he got out in September of 2011, he brought all those business plans he
had developed with him, all those paper spreadsheets and smudged lines.
And he headed out for, okay, normally if you're a tech entrepreneur,
you would go to Silicon Valley.
But Frederick was not.
He was a convicted felon out on parole.
His destination was a halfway house in Tampa, Florida.
And to hear him tell it,
you couldn't imagine a worse place to incubate a tech company.
At this halfway house, every aspect of his life was controlled.
He didn't have the luxury of uninterrupted time in that prison library.
He had to constantly check in or check out.
And they kept saying, you have to get a job.
And no, starting your own company, that doesn't count.
So he started to build Picturegram on the sly.
Initially, his plan was to hire a couple guys, put up a website,
print some photos.
So he calls this photo processing lab.
And he said, but you know, well, it was such a call with the CEO and
all those people, so then he set up this call.
My first conference call, I'm still living in a halfway house.
And how do you take a conference call in a halfway house?
I used to sneak my phone in.
So they had a rule, which is stupid, but you can't have a phone.
They didn't let you have a cell phone.
So I used to sneak my phone in and I'll be in my bunk laying to the side
and on this conference call with our vendor and the CEO and the sales guy.
And basically I have to pitch him.
And you're doing this while laying on a bunk,
speaking quietly in a halfway house.
We're probably eight other people in this room.
So how did you make that pitch?
It actually came out because I told them, I said, I'm looking to build
the app to allow people to send pictures.
They wasn't impressed by that.
You know, there's hundreds of those already.
What are you going to do that's different?
And I said, well, we're going after inmates.
And there's really no service that allow people to send photos to inmates.
And we're going to be the first and we're going to be the best
because we have a unique way to market to them.
And then he's like, well, how do you know this opportunity exists?
I'm like, oh, what am I going to tell them?
Because I'm worried that he's going to say no, if he knows that I've been in prison.
But there's no way for me to hide it because I have too much inside information.
So I take the leap and I tell him, I said, well, actually, I know,
because I did four years in federal prison for distribution of marijuana.
And the phone was just silent.
So I don't know which way it's going to go.
But then the CEO said, you know what?
This is the most interesting that I've heard.
Let's do it. I'm excited about it.
Frederick realized that this thing that he wanted to hide
that he was a little ashamed of was also his best selling point.
He knew the market.
So Frederick teams up with an old friend and starts to raise money.
A thousand bucks here and there from family and friends.
But of course, this is really only half the battle, right?
He spent all of this time trying to overcome the barriers
that being a convicted felon threw up in his path.
But he still faces all the classic problems every other entrepreneur faces.
Right. Like, how do I reach my customers?
How are they going to pay?
Do people want this? Will it work?
The only way they could figure this out was to try it.
So in 2012, they built the website.
They were ready to put out their first ad, get their first customers.
But because this whole thing was aimed at prisoners,
the whole advertising situation was pretty low tech.
They basically had a postcard, a picture postcard
that they mailed out to 500 inmates, a list of inmates
that they found on the Internet somewhere.
The ad copy was pretty simple.
We said, someone wants to send you a pictogram.
And to have them send it to you, go to this website.
And that was it.
Now, some of these postcards had a picture of a mom cooking dinner.
Some had pictures of kids.
Some had pictures of attractive women.
But every postcard offered one free picture sent through the mail
if their loved ones set up an account.
So basically, it's just junk mail.
Yeah, it's absolutely junk mail.
And, you know, a normal piece of junk mail gets a response of like one percent.
So if you send out 500 postcards, you could expect maybe five people to respond.
But remember, Frederick Hudson knew something most people don't.
Inmates love mail.
All of a sudden, like two, three days later,
all these orders started coming in.
People started shipping photos out of that first batch of 500 postcards.
They got something like 135 paying customers.
The response was just nuts.
And it was sort of a revelation for Frederick,
because all along, he'd been thinking about prisoners
and the problems of being in prison.
And he thought of the website as a service for inmates.
But as he started to see these responses, he thought, no, no, no, of course.
Like the real customers are the families.
In all these responses, there are mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters.
It means as much for them to be able to send a photo
as it means for an inmate to get that photo.
Frederick decided to pivot.
Frederick's company has built this giant database of all federal prisoners
in the country, and they're using it to sell all sorts of services.
They started a telephone service that gives families local numbers
so they don't have to pay those sky high prison long distance rates.
And they're growing fast.
They've even ditched that old prison name, Picturegram.
The company has something that feels a little bit more 2015.
Pigeonly, pigeonly, like carrier pigeon, like carrier pigeons.
I travel a lot, so I like traveling.
And no matter where I go, even when I was in Japan,
most recently, there's pigeons there, no matter where I go, there's pigeons.
And I notice how pigeons are so common that we never pay attention to them,
even though they're all around us all the time.
And that's kind of how I see our market a lot of times,
is that it's this market that's here and it's present,
but nobody's really paying attention to them.
That story originally aired in 2015, and Pigeonly is still in business.
They still offer their picture services, but you can also send letters,
articles and even money to people in prison.
The company eventually raised five million dollars in investment.
After the break, our professor teaches us the fundamental lesson of entrepreneurship.
Figuring out what your customers really need.
On this week's episode of Wildcard, actor Ted Danson says

but even your wounds, you kind of have fondness for if you've lived through it
and made amends and all of that stuff.

Hey, everyone, class is back in session
and we're rejoined by Columbia Business School Professor Angela Lee,
to whom I will turn over the laser pointer and PowerPoint slides.
Thank you so much for having me.
I love the story of Frederick Hudson because, you know, it's
he takes what in many cases would be a disadvantage
and he uses it essentially as his pitch for his business.
Yeah. Talk about glass half full and really seeing an opportunity.
I feel like everyone looks around constantly and says,
oh, I have an idea for this business.
I have an idea for this business.
What's the difference between some idea you have that would be great
in the world and an idea that is an actual workable business?
I do think that there is this myth of the visionary
founders sitting in a room and then they're just walking along
and the genius idea hits them across the head.
And I really, really disagree with that myth.
Really? Yeah.
We say that we invest in data driven learners,
which is just so not sexy, right?
People want to be a visionary, a maverick.
But at the end of the day, I think that really great entrepreneurs
are ones who run a lot of experiments.
They look at the data and then they respond according to that data.
Well, when we play the story of Frederick Hudson, he's inspiring.
Is he also a data driven leader?
Absolutely. He knew what the typical response rate was for direct mail.
And he knew that his was way higher.
And he was trying different customer acquisition channels,
different ways to get customers to talk to him and figured,
oh, this is the one that works.
OK, let's go over the very first thing you need to do.
If you have this vague idea and you want to turn it into a business.
The first question as investors, we ask founders is tell me
about who your customer is.
And we're typically looking for three things.
The first thing is demographics.
The second thing is psychographics.
And the third thing is problem in terms of demographics.
These are things like age, gender, income, education level.
Most founders know this pretty well.
The second thing is psychographics.
Psychographics is can I picture this customer in my head?
What are they wearing?
Where do they go shopping? What magazines do they read?
In the case of Frederick Hudson, he lived with them.
Or it was his own family.
And then the third thing is what is the problem you are solving for this customer?
And I find that people often describe problems and products as like here,
the 17 bullet points of why my product is great.
And what I always say is that's great.
I love that you have 17 benefits and features,
but I'm one human talking to another human.
And I say you have to try this app, this product.
What do I say to my friend?
And if you can't encapsulate it in a human voice
in a few words, to me, you don't really understand
the problem you're solving for your customers.
In fancy business schools, they call this the unique value proposition,
which which is a fancy way of saying what?
Do you understand the pain point you're solving for your customer?
Pain point being the thing that drives them nuts,
that they would pay money to solve.
So in the case of Pitch and Lee, the pain points for prisoners
were how hard it is to get a picture of your mom or your girlfriend
and how much they had to pay for simple services
that we all take for granted, like using the telephone.
Exactly.
So if I am thinking about starting my own business,
what can I learn from Frederick Hudson?
The two things I think you can really take away from Frederick's story
is one, talk to your customers.
I think a mistake a lot of founders make is say that whole,
like I'm going to sit in my garage for two years
and build something brilliant and then unleash it upon the world
is just very silly.
And never ask anyone, would you actually pay for this thing?
Exactly.
So what I love is that he started talking to customers really early
while he was in prison, but also once he left as well
and he was at the halfway house.
So talk to your customers.
That's one big message.
And the second is test your idea.
Don't think that you are going to be brilliant
and unleash something upon the world.
Test it by maybe doing a survey,
maybe creating a really simple email newsletter
to see how many people open or click on the shiny green button.
Testing is key.
And be willing to pivot, to change what you're doing
in response to what you actually hear
and what people actually want.
Absolutely.
I think being flexible is very much the name of the game.
Okay.
Let's do a quick recap here.
Know your customers.
Figure out what's causing them pain
and how you alone can solve it.
And start to test your solution.
Actually listen to what your customers are saying.
Then, and only then, can you start to think about the money.
That brings us to our second case study
about how to find the money to start a business
and how to figure out how much customers are really willing to pay.
It's about a pair of twins who saw a delicious pain point
but then weren't quite sure about the next step.
Producer Brittany Cronin has our story.
It aired on The Indicator in 2021.
Raeshawn and LaShawn Middleton are both trained chefs.
But at the beginning of the pandemic,
they lost their restaurant jobs.
And as the months went by
and they waited and waited for restaurants to reopen,
they started to get worried.
What if their jobs just never came back?
All we know is restaurant.
So it was one of those things was whether or not
are we going to go back to restaurants
and not be guaranteed a job?
So we were like, we have to figure something out.
And then one day they get this idea.
They're hungry, they decide what they really want
are some steamed crabs.
But it's late summer, it's pouring rain outside
and they don't want to leave home to go get the crabs.
Literally, I was being lazy
and didn't want to go get the crabs
and realize no one delivered steamed blue crab.
So Raeshawn and LaShawn are like, wait a minute.
We are trained chefs and we've grown up on crabs.
They knew some people in the crab business
and decided they could buy and steam
and deliver crabs by themselves.
They had a car they could cook in their mom's kitchen.
So they made up some advertising flyers,
steamed crab delivered to your home.
I had woke up and I was like, okay,
I'm going to put the flyers up.
But I was like shaking.
I was like so nervous because I was like,
this is ridiculous.
Like how am I going to start a business?
Like it's one of those like moments where you're like,
am I really going to do this?
So they go out, they're putting up flyers,
they have low expectations.
This is just day one.
And they are pretty immediately confronted
with the one thing that they had not yet done.
The last door was my neighbor.
And she was like, okay, put me down for a dozen.
I was like, are you serious?
Mind you, we didn't even have prices yet.
Yeah, we didn't have prices.
We didn't know what we were going to order right away.
We didn't have prices.
We, she was like, how much?
We were like, I was like, I don't know, like $30.
So we just made up a number.
A dozen steamed crabs for 30 bucks.
And to put that into perspective for you,
most places sell extra large crabs for a hundred dollars.
We sold it for $30.
And because we not knowing,
because we just didn't do any research,
we were just like, let's just try it.
And so then when people start biting,
you're like, wait, really?
This is actually working?
Oh, wait, wait, we actually got to,
we actually have to get it together.
That story from Brittany Cronin in 2021.
When we last spoke to the sisters a couple of years ago,
they had raised their prices
and they were doing okay.
They had about 10 to 20 orders a week.
One sister would steam the crabs
in their mother's kitchen
and the other would deliver the orders.
A lot of businesses started during the pandemic
did not survive.
The sisters even got offered
their old restaurant jobs back.
But Rayshon and Lashon said no.
When I called them last month for an update,
they said, why don't you come down
and see our brand new restaurant, R&L Crab.
We'll visit after the break.
On this week's episode of Wild Card,
poet Nikki Giovanni says you can choose your family.
I recommend dogs.
But they're faithful, they're intelligent,
and they always love you.

Rayshon and Lashon Middleton
clearly had something their customers needed.
Fresh hot crabs delivered to their doorstep.
But ramping up a small family business
to a successful brick and mortar store
with employees, that took some figuring out.
My name is Ray, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
When I arrive at R&L Crab,
the twins are mopping the floor.
Trying to prevent it from being super wet.
I love that you're doing your own janitorial work.
Oh, we do everything here.
We do everything.
The restaurant is tucked into the corner of a strip mall.
They now run the crab delivery service out of here,
plus take walk-in customers.
It's been a wild two years.
After our story on The Merit,
a TV network showed up to profile the sisters.
They were running the business
out of their mom's kitchen at the time,
and the crab orders started to pour in.
We were just running out of space
because once you go from 20 orders for the whole week,
then 30 orders for just the day,
once you go from that,
now we have to hold on to way more crabs.
Did your mom say you have to get out?
She was getting a little fed up
with the crab smell, I guess.
I was going to say,
30 crabs a day could probably smell up the place.
It was getting a little hectic, it was.
There is a standard playbook
for expanding a successful business.
Get a loan, or investors.
Hire people.
Serve more of your customer base.
But the twins told me
they had no idea how to do any of this.
They didn't know who to trust.
They made a crucial decision, though.
Maybe they could get along
by just reinvesting all their profits
back into the business.
They moved out of their mom's place
to a professional kitchen,
hired drivers,
but the money was always tight.
We were like, how are we going to pay for this?
We have no money.
We tried every avenue.
We both took out two personal loans.
Me and Ray took out two personal loans separately
to pay for it.
Feeling a little overwhelmed,
they brought on a business partner,
an older man who was a friend
and a mentor to them.
They gave him a percentage of the business
and hoped he would help them launch
this actual brick and mortar restaurant.
But then they all started to clash.
All I'm going to say is that
I think there was a moment
where he forgot that we were the CEOs
and the owners.
And it started to be more his business
and not our business.
Started to be like,
I own the business.
You can't tell me anything.
This is my store, my business.
Completely forgetting R&L.
Lawyers got involved
and the twins learned an important lesson.
Be careful going into business
with friends and family.
The twins say the partnership has been dissolved,
but they did manage to get the restaurant open.
They give me a short tour.
There's a large kitchen,
plastic bins in the back for the live crabs.
Today we got what?
13 boxes dropped today.
13 boxes of crabs?
13 boxes, yep.
They're a gorgeous bright blue.
I didn't expect that.
He's in Louisiana.
There's an order up for a half dozen.
And the little guys do put up a fight.
A giant pot, of course.
And then you just throw them right in
and know you have a secret ingredient.
Yes, we use beer.
What kind of beer?
We can't say.
We can't say.
We don't tell anybody what beer we use.
LaShawn and Rashaun say
they don't want to go back
to working for someone else.
Even though they are in debt
and always hustling for new customers,
they say their happiest times
are when they're working holidays.
Knocking out 60 orders of crabs
and dancing along to the music in the kitchen.
For us, it's worth it just because
I felt like we were born to be entrepreneurs.
You get more of a quality of life.
So you just got to choose your balances.
You say more quality of life,
but when I walked in,
you were mopping the floor.
It's not, to me, that's not work.
To me, that's just taking care of my store
because I love it.
I'm so grateful.
Opening the store was a huge moment,
an accomplishment.
And then you just remind yourself sometimes,
even if you're cleaning
and you're wiping down something,
you're reminding, like, I started,
I was in my mom's house.
I was in the ghost kitchen.
Now I have a store with my name on it.
That name again?
R&L Crab in Columbia, Maryland.
Stop by and say hi.
I'm going to bring in our professor again,
Angela Lee.
What's a big lesson you can learn
from the R&L Crab story,
from the Crab twins?
I think a big lesson
that everybody shouldn't be aware of
is that entrepreneurship is really hard.
Yeah.
I hear a lot of folks say,
I'm going to quit my day job
and I'm going to go open a bakery
or I'm going to go open an ice cream shop.
And there's this very idyllic view.
And I think just recognizing
that you're going to be doing everything,
especially the first couple of years.
And I always tell people
to talk to an entrepreneur.
It's not this dreamlike state
that you might think it might be.
And for a lot of small businesses,
it's not like venture capitalists
are beating a path to their doorway.
The businesses are doing something called bootstrapping.
So what is bootstrapping?
So when you're starting a company,
you need money, right?
And there are two ways to get that money.
One is from customer revenue.
So you sell crabs,
you now have money to invest
and maybe buy a second car
or to buy a larger kitchen.
The second way is to raise outside capital
from venture capitalists
who will just say,
here's a couple hundred thousand dollars
or a million dollars.
They are going to get something
in exchange for that money.
And what they get in exchange
is a percentage of your company.
So the benefit of bootstrapping
is you own 100% of your company
and you have control
over exactly how you run it,
how fast you want to grow,
where you want to expand geographically.
The drawback is you have to make money
to get money.
And so it's a little bit
of a slower growth process.
Or have credit cards
and someone willing
to give you a personal loan.
And then on the venture capital side,
the benefit is typically
you're going to get faster injections of capital.
But the drawback is somebody now owns
20, 40, maybe 60% of your company.
How can you decide
which route to go?
It seems like taking a lot of money
from people is the more fun route,
but maybe not.
You know, it's funny.
When people ask me this question,
they expect me to whip out
an Excel spreadsheet
or to start talking numbers.
And the first question I ask them is,
what do you want your life to look like
for the next five to 10 years?
Do you want to take vacation?
How many hours a week
do you want to work?
And if the answer is
you want a reasonable lifestyle,
you probably shouldn't take
venture capital as capital.
They are going to ask you
to grow very quickly
and work very hard
for probably the next five to 10 years.
Anjali, you're scaring me here.
You're saying it's hard to be an entrepreneur
that you have to really
understand your customers.
And there are people
who want to take advantage of you.
You might go into personal debt.
You teach venture capital.
You teach people
how to be better entrepreneurs.
And yet it seems like you're saying,
you're saying don't do it.
It's terrible.
It's a lot of work.
I think my job as an educator
is to explain the realities of this.
And I do spend a lot of time saying
this is what your day's going to look like.
This is what your week's going to look like.
This is what your year is going to look like.
And I also think for those of you
who are listening and thinking
about doing this,
go talk to five founders
who are in year three of their startup
and literally ask them, you know,
how are things going?
What are you struggling with?
And if you hear that
and you get jazzed and get excited,
then by all means go forth and conquer.
Anjali is a professor
at Columbia Business School.
Thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you so much for having me.
We will have seven more classes here
before you can get your Planet Money MBA.
So tune in every Wednesday until Labor Day.
And on our very last episode,
we will have a treat.
We will take your business idea pitches.
If during this episode
you thought of something cool
that can solve a problem,
you could try it out
on our business school professors.
It's like shark tank,
but no one will be mean to you
or give you money.
Kind of a guppy tank.
It doesn't have to be some big invention.
It can be just a tiny thing
that you want changed in the world.
When I was in business school,
I pitched a portable campfire
on a bicycle
that you could then make s'mores
wherever you wanted.
S'more cycle did not take off,
but your idea might.
So send us an email
planetmoney at npr.org
and put pitch in the subject line.
We'll even invite
Professor Anjali Lee back
to give you feedback on your plan.
As you're thinking about your pitch,
remember these vocabulary words this week.
Demographics and psychographics.
Who are your customers
and what are their lives like?
And most importantly,
what problem can you solve for them?
This is often called a pain point
and your solution
is your unique value proposition.
One more term, bootstrapping.
When you build your business
as you go along,
no outside investment.
Planet Money Summer School
will be running every Wednesday
until Labor Day
to ease those intellectual pain points.
