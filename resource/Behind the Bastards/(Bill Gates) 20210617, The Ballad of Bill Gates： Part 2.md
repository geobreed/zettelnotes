--- Robert Evans:
What's hung over my 
the host of this podcast 

--- Sophie:
that's nice

--- Robert Evans:
that's behind the bastards,
the podcast 
that's being recorded at the unreasonably early hour of 
Sophie
What is it? What time is it right now?

--- Sophie:
it's two thirty nine p.m.

--- Robert Evans:
Jesus Christ.
So 
like the crack of dawn, we're up doing this.
I just hope you all 
I hope you all respect it.
This is why we have to heavily.
We have to 
we have to sue anybody who distributes this podcast for free,
because if all of the 

--- ?? :
right 

--- Robert Evans:
all of the work back breaking labor,
getting up at the crack of two thirty nine p.m.
to record this podcast 
after I was drinking last night, 
unbelievable.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Dedication, you know, 

--- Sophie:
I think we started around one.
And yesterday you text me being like, 
what time are we starting?
And I said one 
you go, Jesus, Sophie, 

--- Robert Evans:
yes

--- Sophie:
that's so early.

--- Robert Evans:
I know. 
I know.
This is 
this is the dedication 
that I bring to my craft, which is why.

--- Sophie:
Well, Andrew, what do you consider early?

--- Robert Evans:
you all owe my thirty five dollars.

--- Andrew T:
I know 
I'm on the other side of things.
I started waking up super early.
so

--- Sophie:
Yeah. 

--- Robert Evans:
Well, Andrew.

--- Andrew T:
Oh, yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
Drew in NT.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
T drizzle. 
Do people call you T drizzle?

--- Sophie:
They should.

--- Andrew T:
I think 
I think they actually have on
fellow 
I heart podcast.
The Daily Zeitgeist, that feels 
like exactly the guy that they would.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, yeah.
I think it's 
T drizzle is a good name.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 

--- Robert Evans:
So we're just going to roll forward with that.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, Andrew.
Hey, how are you?
How are you feeling about Bill Gates so far?
Have you learned anything new?

--- Andrew T:
I 
we 
I feel like we have gotten.
We haven't gotten as far as the bombshells 
so far, I'm feeling about the same as I did when I walked in, 
which is like, you know

--- Sophie:
fuck bill gates?

--- Robert Evans:
yeah.

--- Andrew T:
But not like, 
seriously, fuck Bill Gates.

--- Sophie:
yeah yeah yeah yeah

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, fuck that guy.

--- Sophie:
Casual, 
just like casual stoic.
Yeah. Fuck Bill Gates.

--- Robert Evans:
fuck bill gates

--- Andrew T:
I don't 
I don't think he's gotten past.
And again, 
it sounded like that was going to be a point of a
potential debate, 
but I would argue he I don't think he has eclipsed
any given billionaire, 
any given tech billionaire in badness yet

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, at this point. 

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah. 

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. Yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
So 
let's talk about what happens next.
When we last left Bill Gates, 
he just succeeded in burning
tens of millions of dollars 
and tens of thousands of man hours
fighting against a federal antitrust case.
He won in the end, 
as billionaires nearly always do.
But the whole process exhausted him emotionally.
Microsoft's Nasdaq value had been cut in half,
which destroyed about 200 billion dollars 
in fake money held by rich assholes like Gates.
They made it all back, of course, 
because they didn't actually lose anything.
But on paper, they had less of an impossible fortune for a while.
Now, one long term impact of the antitrust suit is that 
for all time, Bill Gates will remain a convicted monopolist.
The stink this put on him in Microsoft 
lasted longer than the actual charges.
By September of 1996, 
a huge number of top executives had fled the company.
This was the dot com boom.
And sexy new e-businesses were starting every day.
A lot of opportunists figured 
as the antitrust case started spinning up 
that Microsoft's day in the sun was over 
and it was time to find the next big tech grift.
Corey Doctorow will argue 
that we owe Google's existence in part 
to the trauma Bill felt over the antitrust suit.
Gates had noted in the past 
that lingering fear of the federal government
is what stopped him from doing the same thing to Google
that he'd done to Netscape.
In 2019, Bill was asked by Kara Swisher
why Microsoft hadn't bought Android before Google.
This was just seven years after the antitrust action.
And he claims that it was 
he was just too scared of the DOJ to risk it.
So, again, 
even though the government doesn't win this case,

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
it is good to run this thing 
because it stops people like Bill Gates
from fucking up as much things as they are. 

--- Andrew T:
Right. Right.
And it sounds like enough of this was simply like 
on a personal level he was scared of the humiliation of it

--- Robert Evans:
yeah, he didn't want to do another deposition.

--- Andrew T:
yeah fascinating

--- Robert Evans:
now, the antitrust case had more of an immediate impact on Gates.
It convinced him to step down from his position as 
at the head of Microsoft.
Sort of. 
In 1998, Steve Ballmer had become president of Microsoft,
taking over more of the day to day management of the company.
As Bill Gates began to pull back 
in 2000, Gates stepped down
as CEO of Microsoft and Ballmer took his place.
Bill was 44 at the time, 
and he remained the chairman of the board
and chief software architect.
At the time, this was billed as a way for Gates,
whose public image was of a genius programmer
to spend his time exploring new technology.
2000 would also mark the point at which Gates 
increasingly got involved with philanthropy.
Now, before we get into the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
we should probably step back 
and cover some of the developments
in Bill's personal life during the late 1990s
that we sort of missed 
while we were talking about business stuff last episode.
1995 was obviously a big year for Microsoft, the company
and for the tech industry as a whole.
But 1994 was an even more momentous year for Bill's personal life.
On the positive side of things, 
it's the year he married Melinda French,
his now about to be former wife.
At the time they started dating, 
Melinda was a Microsoft employee,
a product manager.
She started working there in 1987, 
the year after she graduated from college.
Today, this kind of relationship 
sets off immediate alarm bells for a lot of people.
But for decades, it was kind of framed in the media
as like a Pam and Jim style office romance.

--- Andrew T:
oh

--- Robert Evans:
Bill and Melinda both gave interviews over the years
playing up how cute their beginnings were.
He flirted at her when they sat together at a conference,
which what is the chance Bill did not arrange to sit next to her?
We know this man.

--- Andrew T:
yeah, 
right right

--- Robert Evans:
He absolutely made that happen.

--- Andrew T:
His actual MO.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 
that later they just happened to run into each other
in a company parking lot.
Again, 
he absolutely engineered that.
And Bill asked her out on a date.
And for a long time, 
the story was they fell in love
and became a billionaire power couple at the end.
Reality was, of course, much grosser,
but we'll talk about that later.
1994 was also a year of tragedy for the Gates family.
Bill had remained close with his parents.
He moved Microsoft back to Seattle 
in part so he could be near them.
He had his dad's legal firm represent the company,
and he and his parents maintained their tradition of Sunday dinner.
He bought a house near them to facilitate this.
Ever since the late 1980s, when he got fuck you money,
Bill's mom had advised him to get into philanthropy.
And since Bill had some control issues with his mother,
this became a source of tension between them.
She would press him to give away his fortune and he'd snap,
I'm just trying to run my company.
Mama Gates eventually harangued her boy into raising money for the United Way.
This, of course, led other nonprofits to beg him for money.
And soon he was overwhelmed by all the requests.
He kept being too busy to deal with it,
and his mom kept pressuring him 
until she was diagnosed 
with some horrible fucking cancer even rich people can't escape.
And she died in 1994.
Bill Senior was as devastated by this as you'd expect.
And for a time, he struggled to find ways to fill his days.
Eventually, he asked his son and daughter-in-law
if he could start going through their stack of requests for philanthropy
and give some of their money away.
This, as is claimed in later interviews,
was kind of the start of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
And before the foundation itself existed,
they just kind of gave him 
like a hundred million dollars to hand out, basically, 

--- Andrew T:
like sure, 

--- Robert Evans:
like 80 bucks for them, you know?

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
And 
so, yeah, 
for most of like the late 90s,
it's just kind of his dad handling the Gates philanthropy.
But then 
Bill quits being the CEO of Microsoft in like 2000,
and Melinda and he start taking a more active role in philanthropy.
The way this was generally framed in the media was
Bill Gates leaves Microsoft behind to save the world.
And there are a lot of articles,
even up to the present day with similar titles.
Back in February of this year, there was an article titled
Bill Gates has a plan to save the world and the economists,
which is like puffing up one of his books about climate change or some shit.
But there's been a bunch of pieces like that, right?

--- Andrew T:
right right

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah.
Now, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation started officially in the year 2000.
It began with, 
I think, a hundred million dollars,
which was like the Bill Gates equivalent.
Again, like 80 bucks.
The foundation expanded massively in 2006,
when Bill Gates convinced Warren Buffett
to give most of his fortune away to the organization.
He claimed that he felt Bill and Melinda
could be trusted to use it for good.
And if you just sort of watch by the sidelines,
that probably looked like a defensive point, a defensible point.
For most of the public crusade 
for years, the most public crusade of the Gates Foundation was their war against malaria.
By 2018, they put almost four billion dollars
towards fighting the deadly disease around the world
in a mix of aid programs to struggling nations,
grants to researchers and scientists, all that stuff.
Now, 
malaria has probably killed more human beings
than any other single cause in history.
It's like the number one killer of human beings across all time.
So good. 
Good thing to fight.

--- Andrew T:
Right. 

--- Robert Evans:
I would 
I would agree.

--- Andrew T:
sounds good
yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
sounds good.
Yeah. 
And Bill certainly can't be faulted for a lack of ambition here.
He has stated his goal is the total elimination of malaria.
And scientists seem to suggest this is possible.
Now, this is an ongoing struggle.
I haven't found anything that suggests the Gates Foundation has been like 
ineffective in their struggle against malaria.
Obviously, they haven't beaten it, 
but that's, you know, 
pretty big,
pretty big task.
And it's probably fair to say 
that their advocacy and money has contributed to a lot of life-saving programs
and aided in the battle against one of mankind's deadliest foes.
The Gateses have also pledged ten billion dollars over the next decade to provide free vaccines to the world's poor.
Through its Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, or GAVI,
the Foundation has vaccinated millions of kids in impoverished countries against polio and other horrible shit.
Bill and Melinda take some credit for the fact that 
between 1990 and 2012, 
total deaths of children under five dropped from 12.6 million to 6.6 million.
Now, there's no way to evaluate how much of an impact 
they had on that, but vaccinating kids absolutely saves lives.
Here's the thing, though.
The whole story is not just 
the whole question should not just be,
does this foundation's work save lives?
Because that's not all we're talking about here.
And it's not something you can answer that simply,
because the tens of billions of dollars in that foundation
were able to come from Gates and other plutocrats
because they didn't pay that shit in taxes.
It's wonderful to vaccinate kids,
but the foundation brings more than free medicine.
It spreads a specific ideology 
about who should have wealth
and about how problems ought to be solved in our society.
I want to quote now from a book called The New Profits of Capital,
which goes into some detail about what I find so unsettling in Gates's ideology.
As Bill Gates has rightly noted,
they are more interested in cures for baldness 
than in cures for malaria.
Why?
Melinda Gates argues that there is simply no rich world market for products like diarrhea or pneumonia vaccines.
Their solution is to use the Gates Foundation 
to create such a market in poor countries.
If we could stimulate the pharmaceutical companies
through public-private partnerships to create vaccines,
if we could guarantee them a market of millions of children
getting this vaccine and then being paid for it in the developing world,
if we could commit to a market and knew that demand would be there,
we could incent them with the right research dollars
to actually create those vaccines.
That's Bill.
Now Bill is, above all else, 
a believer in the power of profit-driven capitalism.
He thinks the best way to do good is by providing profit incentives
for corporations to carry out behavior that also helps suffering people.
But this still means that those profits are valued more in his world than those lives.
When Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine,
he was asked why he did not patent it,
and he said you might as well try to patent the son.
To Salk, a man whose contribution to our species is literally incalculable,
the vaccine was not a commodity, it was health.
It was millions of human lives not cut short,
hundreds of thousands of cumulative years not lived in pain.
The Gates Foundation has done things that save lives,
but this is not a zero-sum game.
The question isn't free vaccines
Gates vaccines or not,
it's do we let individual men accumulate the wealth necessary to operate foundations like this,
or do we build a world with less inequality where human beings don't need a profit motive to vaccinate starving children?

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
and also like 
where, you know, 
philanthropy isn't at the whim of,
you know, a handful of white dudes.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, exactly, 
and that's kind of what we're building to.
I assure you this becomes more than just an ideological argument.
There's solid stuff to dig in here,
but I want to quote again from that book, The New Profits of Capital.
Turning something into a commodity means it is no longer a right,
or even potentially a right.
It means that the commodity's value is now judged primarily on whether or not it will turn a profit,
and people's access to the commodity hinges upon their ability to pay for it.
In the United States, where healthcare is a commodity,
the difference in lifespan between a poor black man
and a wealthy white woman is 14 years.
We are 46th in the world for infant mortality,
despite being the wealthiest country on earth.
Babies in poor states, like Alabama,
are twice as likely to die as infants in wealthy areas.
This is part of why virtually all public health experts agree
that universal healthcare is a good idea.
But as Nicole Ashoff writes, quote,
when we frame the problem of poor people in the global south dying from preventable diseases as a market failure problem,
we close off the possibility of building a healthcare system in which healthcare is a right and does not depend on one's ability to pay.
And that's 
what's so toxic about the Gates Foundation.

--- Andrew T:
right, the cost
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah, his idea, 
his whole idea.
Like, yeah, it's wonderful to get vaccines to poor people,
but the way he wants to do that 
is by creating a financial incentive to do that

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
rather than by saying, 
well, we all have a responsibility, even to people outside of our country.
And maybe looking at the COVID-19 pandemic,
we can say, 
oh, yeah, actually, we all benefit in a purely selfish way

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
from making sure that healthcare is available worldwide.

--- Andrew T:
Turns out we are all in this together.
And 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
like 

--- Robert Evans:
as opposed to let's make it profitable to save children.
Um, 
in 2015, the Gates Foundation funded a study in the Lancet 
and that study, it was about like public health options worldwide.
And that study called for universal healthcare.
Despite this, in that year's development report,
the Gates Foundation claimed that universal healthcare has,
quote, limitations as a global development goal.
And that evidence as to whether or not it helps health outcomes is mixed.
Bill Gates is on the side of intellectual property,
the right of corporations to profit massively from vaccines developed by scientists, often using public money.
Millions in foundation funds go to pharmaceutical companies.
In fact, shockingly large amounts of Gates Foundation money goes to big businesses and a lot of times as gifts to those businesses.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
For example, in 2014, 
the Gates Foundation announced an $11 million grant to MasterCard
so that they could build a financial inclusion lab in Kenya.
The basic idea is Kenya needs foreign investments,
but investing in Africa is risky.
So you have to bribe MasterCard to take a chance on Kenya.
And that aid is not a loan or investment.
It was a gift that we're giving fucking MasterCard $11 million.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
And the Gates Foundation does this a lot.
They give multi-million dollar gifts to mega corporations like Vodafone,
who themselves pay no corporate tax in the UK.
The Gates Foundation also gives gifts to the Monsanto Corporation,
who Bill argues should be bribed to take over more and more responsibility
for agriculture in Africa.
he
he
There's all these articles where Bill talking about how scary it is
the population of Africa is set to explode.
And number one, 
there's some uncomfortable racial undertones.

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
If his obsessive concern with the population of Africa,
he always firms as like,
I'm just worried that there's not going to be enough food.
They don't grow enough food to like support themselves there.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
But his solution is 
let's pay Monsanto to like subsidize or 
let's pay Monsanto

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
to subsidize seeds that they have to buy
that are genetically modified so that 
they can't share them.
It's this fucking thing capitalists have been doing since the 1700s, right?
The 1770s, a giant British corporation takes over most of north and eastern India and immediately are like,
oh, all these farming villages have like arrangements with each other
and like social welfare programs to take care of each other
in the event of a drought.
Or if like one village's harvest is bad, let's get rid of all that
because we want to centralize all of our farming
to make it more profitable.
And then 30 million people starve to death.
And it's the same basic,
we're not going to go into this nearly enough,
but Gates is a lot of like,
he keeps talking about how his ideas to reform farming in Africa
so that it can feed more people,
none of which involved talking to people who have been farming in Africa for generations.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
Like it's just like, 
well, let's bring this mega corporate.
Let's make it profitable from Monsanto.
Like fucking Bill.

--- Andrew T:
That's the only way to do it.
Right. And it is just like that.
That is how people like that view the world 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
and view solutions.
Oh, God.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah. Yeah.

--- Andrew T:
pretty grim

--- Robert Evans:
Daryl Ray is an agricultural expert from the University of Tennessee,
and he fears the consequences of these investments for small farmers.
Quote, 
we need to take farmers exactly where they are at the moment and help them be more productive using their knowledge and technology that would be appropriate to add to it and then gradually move them into a higher rate of production
rather than talking about them buying Monsanto products or other kinds of products they can't afford to have to buy every year,
as is the case with hybrid seed.
So 
again, 
not just me saying this is bad.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Other people are saying there's a lot of scary.
And it's again, you're not a farmer, Bill.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
You don't know anything about farming.
And 
you don't know enough to know if the experts you're paying
because in a lot of cases, you're paying them
to justify things you already believe.

--- Andrew T:
right right
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Like, you're not you're not just saying
here's billions of dollars for the best idea.
You're saying I'm pretty sure we need to use modern

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Western agricultural corporations to improve yields

--- Andrew T:
how could we
how could we prove
This is the best way to do it.

--- Robert Evans:
Who can I hire to agree with that

--- Andrew T:
it's exactly backwards
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
It's exactly backwards.
It's exactly how you don't do this.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
And again, this is one of those things like people talk about
state communism versus state capitalism.
Fucking 
the 
the like Russia and China did versions of this
that led to the great famines of the 20th century 

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
in parts of the world.

--- Andrew T:
This is 
this is like 
this is the mouse sparrows.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
exactly the same thing.

--- Robert Evans:
we
Because of my 
this new idea and this new technology,
I know better than people who have been making food 
to feed this place for forever.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
So let's just change everything.
It's just 
it's 
the incredible hubris of man 
go
Anybody who wants to reform global agriculture like this
should have to work on a farm somewhere for 10 fucking years.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
Like just just fucking work on like 
grow some goddamn potatoes, Bill Gates, like 
Jesus Christ.
I say that, but then Mark Zuckerberg did that
and wound up murdering goats with lasers or some shit.
Maybe not.

--- Andrew T:
What?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, he killed a goat with a laser.
It's a whole thing.

--- Andrew T:
Well, but I mean, 
that's the I think the addition to what you're saying 
is they should have to do it and do it successfully.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, listen to people who do it 

--- Andrew T:
which is why

--- Robert Evans:
and
and see what they do.
And then, yeah, sure, 
I'm not going to say like a guy who's capable of running a giant corporation
wouldn't have any insights that are useful, 
but 
probably not.
Certainly not 
at his current level of knowledge about fucking farming.

--- Andrew T:
Well, and also like at the 
like it shows who he values and who,
you know, every farmer is expendable, clearly.

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
But like, you know, no corporation is expendable.

--- Robert Evans:
It's this 
it's a version of the same problem that like social media has,
like where 
if you're 
if you're famous and rich and prominent,
you have to have a stance, a take on everything.
Right.
One way this goes is like 
every Hollywood celebrity,
you know, has to have a take on everything happening in the world.
Right.
And the other way this goes is, you know,
the most toxic version of this is 
a billionaire deciding to change
how agriculture works in Africa because 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
he got rich in the 90s, like
It's 
it's just.
But you know who else got rich in the 90s, Andrew T.

--- Andrew T:
Hit me 

--- Robert Evans:
the product and services that support this podcast.

--- Andrew T:
owwww

--- Robert Evans:
Oh, yeah.
All 90s babies.

--- Andrew T:
Got me again.

====== ads ======

--- Robert Evans:
Oh, we're back, 
Andrew.

--- Andrew T:
What up?

--- Robert Evans:
Andrew, 
you see the new 
you see the new they made a new rugrats,
but they made it all CGI and.

--- Sophie:
Oh, it's so weird.
I don't like it.

--- Andrew T:
oh god

--- Robert Evans:
It looked so good.
Just 
just 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
rerun rugrats.
It's perfect.
It doesn't need anything else.
Kids will still like it.

--- Sophie:
They made Tommy Pickles head scary.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 
I just like the old art was just so classic and charming.

--- Sophie:
The lady who did 

--- Andrew T:
oh my god

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Sophie:
the lady who does Tommy Pickles voice
lived behind my childhood home.

--- Robert Evans:
Oh, really?
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
oh god

--- Robert Evans:
that's 
that's rad 
because that was a great show.
I just don't get it.
I don't get this at all.
um, 
it's 
it's 
it's horrible.

--- Sophie:
don't

--- Robert Evans:
People should stop making things.

--- Sophie:
I don't know why we need to ruin 
a good thing is what I'm saying.

--- Andrew T:
ok

--- Sophie:
Oh, so speaking of good things ruined.

--- Robert Evans:
Speaking of ruining good things.
So 
Bill's friendly gifts to the Monsanto Corporation,
MasterCard and Vodafone are part of a massive global trend
that the Gates Foundation has largely driven.
Now that the Walton Foundation, the Walmart people,
that's a big part of this, too.
There's a couple of big ones.
I'm going to quote from a write up in Jacobin
about this trend 
more and more corporate philanthropy 
is not about corporations giving money to charity.
Companies actually do remarkably little of that.
As a 2002 Harvard Business Review article pointed out,
over the past 15 year period,
charity by U.S. companies as a percentage of profits fell by 50 percent.
More recently, Slate reported that corporate giving had nosedived
from a high of two point one percent of pre-tax profits
during the mid 1980s to just point eight percent in 2012.
Corporate philanthropy today is about private tax-exempt donors
such as the Gates Foundation giving their charity to corporations.
Now this kind of charity is not just profoundly undemocratic.
It skews global attitudes towards public health
and filters them through the lenses of a handful of billionaires
who like Gates have never had to struggle a single moment of their lives.
Gates Foundation donations to the U.N. health agency
outweigh even the U.S. government's contributions to that body.
As a result, people at the U.N. who disagree with Gates
quickly find themselves out on their asses.
The same is often true of the WHO, the World Health Organization,
which is also heavily subsidized by Gates.
As Laurie Garrett wrote in Foreign Affairs,
few policy initiatives or normative standards set by the WHO
are announced before they have been casually,
unofficially vetted by Gates Foundation staff.
In 2011, Oxford health economist David Stuckler argued, quote
global health is ruled by a few private donors who make decisions in secret.
The capacity to decide what is relevant and how it will be addressed
is in the hands of very few 
who ultimately are accountable to their own interests.
So that's rad. That's good.

--- Andrew T:
Right.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah.

--- Andrew T:
And it is like, right, 
as you get further into it,
it is like the global health of it.
We just lived through. 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
This is why like 
the value of 
really only caring about human beings,
or at least like 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
trying something outside of a profit motive,
like every 
everything that we did during COVID that was profit driven
caused death and suffering 
and loss of business,
which is the craziest part.

--- Robert Evans:
yeah
Like it's 

--- Andrew T:
business can't even be trusted to make business go well.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, it's all you need to know about the difference
between when health care is primarily about profit
and when it's primarily about people is to look at Cuba.
We'll talk about Cuba a little later,

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
not a government that's without flaws.
You can look at a lot of horrible shit.
They did LGBT people back in like the nineties during the AIDS epidemic and stuff.
But as a rule, they put make they 
public health is like the number one thing
that they worry about over there.
And so they have like a lung cancer vaccine 
and they have a COVID vaccine.
And now they're giving it away for free to a bunch of countries.
Like it's 
yeah, 
like it's 
it's 
it's just different
when the goal of health care is not to make some dude 
who lives in Mountain View richer.
Right 
now, since Gates doesn't like the idea of universal health care,
he's resisted supporting the WHO's 1978 Alma Alta Declaration.
This is essentially an international commitment
to strengthen primary care systems
and move towards universal health care in more nations.
It's basically saying 
the best way to support public health worldwide
is to strengthen the primary care systems in those countries
to make them more independent and more capable of caring for people
rather than them needing to rely on foreign NGOs and stuff 
to provide health care.
Right. 
Makes sense.
You know, the Gates Foundation, though, 
pursues market based solutions.
And as a result, according to the Lancet, 
grants made by the foundation often, quote, 
do not reflect the burden of disease endured by those in deepest poverty.
Let's discuss a practical example of how this looks.
If you Google Bill Gates in Africa, 
you will come across an awful lot of articles.
Well, Gates expresses his worry that there might soon be too many Africans.
This is always framed in humanitarian terms.
Fears of famine and climate change.
But I don't know. 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Yo, is that racist?

--- Andrew T:
yeah
it's like
I mean, there's definitely too many Europeans and yet

--- Robert Evans:
way too many Italians.
The birth rate has been falling for years, but not by enough.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 
oh god

--- Robert Evans:
When I'm president, 
that's going to be my number one goal.
Megan, there be less Italians.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 
Sort of an anti Mussolini, if you will.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, I do a reverse Mussolini,
a reverse Alini, if you will.

--- Sophie:
Oh, my God.

--- Robert Evans:
I mean, you know what?
Some very cool people in Milan in the 40s reversed a Mussolini,

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
and that worked out pretty well.

--- Andrew T:
That's sort of the way to do it.
That is 
that is the path you're on.

--- Robert Evans:
You got to go up
flip them upside down.
One less Italian. 
OK, 
good times.
So 
again, 
Gates is concerned about there being too many Africans.
It's always framed as like, 
no, I'm worried about like famine

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
and climate change and all that stuff.
But it's hard to ignore how often he thinks about reproduction
and sex among black Africans.
He thinks about it a lot.
And maybe he shouldn't be.
--------------- correction -----------------
Hey, everybody. 
Robert Evans here.
The initial version of this episode included 
a pretty long critique of HIV program
HIV mitigation program Bill Gates had supported heavily in Africa.
It was based on circumcision.
I critiqued that based largely on 
an article I'd found in the Journal of Future HIV Therapy from 2008
titled male circumcision is not the HIV vaccine we were looking for.
That article included a lot of the critiques I made in the episode,
namely the fact that while circumcision and kind of a perfect environment
can reduce the spread of HIV, 
it didn't seem to actually do it when implemented on a large scale for a variety of reasons, including 
it led to other kind of risky behaviors and whatnot.
People didn't understand they were still supposed to wear condoms.
There are a number of things that we brought up in the episode,
but a concerned fan reached out to me after that
and made me aware of a number of things that I had gotten wrong
and also made me aware of an article in the Lancet Journal of Global Health
from July 2021, which was a systematic review and meta analysis
of a bunch of different studies into exactly this thing,
like whether or not these circumcision programs
can reduce the risk of spreading HIV.
And I'm just going to quote from 
a section of the conclusion here,
which reads, quote,
our systematic review and meta analysis found that,
you know, the circumcision campaigns were not associated
with increased condomless sex or multiple sexual partners
among heterosexual men.
This lack of association persisted across a wide variety of subgroups.
These findings might help alleviate concerns
that widespread MMC programs could lead to risk compensation
and therefore reduce the benefit of MMC.
So it seems like I was wrong on that.
There's still, I have some concerns about it,
but also I'm willing to admit that 
I did not understand this as well as I should have.
So I apologize for that.
If you want to read more, that meta analysis is in the Lancet
and we will put up a couple of other sources
that were sent to me on our website to update the source section.
So I have cut out that chunk of the episode.
There will be a couple of references to it later on,
but, you know, there's nothing we can do about that.
But yeah, here's the 
here's the correction.
I'm sorry for being a hack and a fraud.
--------------- correction -----------------
The charity of the Gates Foundation is all too often itself, 
a form of imperialism,
one that has harmful unforeseen impacts on local populations.
The good news is that 
since Gates is a billionaire narcissist,
he gets to do imperialism on the people of his own country, too.
Which brings us to the very fun story
of the Gates Foundation's war on public education.
Oh, it's some good shit, Andrew.

--- Andrew T:
oh

--- Robert Evans:
It's some good shit.

--- Andrew T:
Jesus.

--- Robert Evans:
Now, it's probably not going to surprise you to learn
that Bill and Melinda also think the market can fix public education.
Hilariously, 
he diagnoses the problem of public education
as a result of the quote 
top down government monopoly provider, a.k.a. the state.
Now, 
we could talk about how funny it is
that he's complaining education is bad because it's a monopoly
and he's Bill Gates.

--- Andrew T:
Right, 

--- Robert Evans:
right, 

--- Andrew T:
right right right.

--- Robert Evans:
you could laugh about that a lot and we will for a second.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Yeah, it's also just like you had unlimited resources

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
to have your fucking horrible dork public school.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah. 

--- Andrew T:
And like or private school
sorry.

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
But it's just like 
like 
thinking that that is the norm,

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
even for private education is like.

--- Robert Evans:
Well, it's interesting 

--- Andrew T:
this is his perspective like

--- Robert Evans:
cause this
the lesson from Bill Gates's childhood is that 
number one, having more money going to a school

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
makes it a better school 
because he was in a rich kid school

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
and the moms were able to raise money for a computer,
which fucking nobody had back then.
He became a billionaire.
But his lesson, 
the lesson he takes is not, well, we should.
You know, I mean, he does the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
does give computers to schools like they have.
That's one of the things that they're 

--- Andrew T:
sure sure.
for now yeah

--- Robert Evans:
But their primary lesson isn't 
the primary lesson they take out of it, isn't that 
like the other big thing it's not just that they had the money 
is that he got freedom.
They altered his education plan, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
bespoke to him and his interests 
to make it work better for him,
which I think is the reasonable lesson to take is that, 
oh, we should tailor the kinds of education kids receive
to the kids in their interests,
because not only will that make them more engaged students,

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
it will help them be more successful people.
That's not the lesson he gets out of this.

--- Andrew T:
but but

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
but also the competitive version of education
that involves driving costs down, 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
you know,
so that you can be the winner of the school education providing game
is the opposite of what happened.

--- Robert Evans:
Yes.

--- Andrew T:
He 
his education was involved tons of resources being thrown at him

--- Robert Evans:
shitloads of resources thrown at him.
Yeah.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.
And that's the best way to educate a fucking kid

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah.
And well, that and freedom.
Like, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
it was a mix of it,
but he wants to bring market logic.
He doesn't know to his credit.
He does not want to.
He's not one of these guys that says 
we should just privatize the whole education system,
but he does want to bring market logic to education.
And that means that schools should compete with each other
or be shut down and replaced if they don't perform well.
During the early aughts, the Gates Foundation started pouring
tens of millions of dollars into things like 
the Knowledge is Power program or KIPP, 
a chain of charter schools that Gates once described as one of 
the very few places where great teachers are being made.
I'm going to quote from the new prophets of capital
to explain how these wonderful schools work.
The KIPP schools follow an extended day strict disciplinary regime.
Students learn how to walk, get off the bus
and use the restroom in the KIPP way.
Students are not allowed to talk at school
except to answer questions, 
and they have to earn their desks.
At some KIPP schools, students who break minor rules
are isolated and forced to wear signs around their necks 
that read miscreant or creep.

--- Andrew T:
oh geez
what

--- Robert Evans:
Like, again, the opposite of what made you successful.
They didn't put you in a room when you were a dick.
They made you stop taking math 
so you could do the thing you were interested in,
like fucking hell, Bill.

--- Andrew T:
It's also like, why?
Why are all like billionaires or equivalent?

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
Why do they only have the same ideas about like,
this is some Gilded age shit

--- Robert Evans:
It is some Gilded age shit.

--- Andrew T:
What is wrong with you idiots?
it's always the same

--- Robert Evans:
We got to make it.
We got to torture him more 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
fucking asshole.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 
Oh, my God.

--- Robert Evans:
KIPP schools are based on the work of Martin Seligman,
a psychologist whose work on learned helplessness
has also been adopted by the CIA 
and their enhanced interrogation slash torture program.
When you're 
when your charter school
has a lot of the same intellectual DNA as the CIA torture program,
there might be a problem there.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, it's tough
it's a tough one

--- Robert Evans:
I don't know.
Maybe that's 
maybe the guys at Guantanamo
are coding all sorts of rad software
we just haven't seen.
That's actually where Zoom came from.

--- Andrew T:
You can tell 
that you can tell.
that's brilliant

--- Robert Evans:
They put a dude in a boo box and he made Zoom.
Oh, now, 
advocates of this system
will point out that KIPP schools
have much higher test scores than normal schools.
However, 
this comes at the loss of many of their students.
Kids who don't get with the program are counseled out or expelled.
Only 40 percent of them graduate.
So 
the reason why KIPP schools have high test scores
is they kick out the kids
who aren't good at that particular kind of school.

--- Andrew T:
right right right

--- Robert Evans:
This is how charter schools work across the country,
which isn't to say there are an excellent.
I know some people who went to very good charter schools
and they're very grateful
for the education that they got.

--- Andrew T:
well yeah

--- Robert Evans:
We're not talking about individual charter schools here.
I'm sure there are a number of people
listening with good experiences.
We're talking about the trend,
the national trend of how this program,
these programs work.
And this is a major trend among charter schools,
some of which suspend as many of half of their students in a year.
Low performing students,
kids with emotional or psychological disabilities.
These kids are denied admission or purged.
This is why in 2014, the Department of Education
had to issue a guidance reminding charter schools
that they had to obey civil rights laws.
That's a good thing to have to remind kids.
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
all this like quasi like libertarian shit.

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
It always is like, 
hey, 
but also you have to obey,
you know, basic decency.

--- Robert Evans:
It's amazing because in 20 years
there's going to be a billionaire
who fucking played Bioshock as a kid
and is going to be like,
I'm going to give the schools $4 million
to make Rapture, but a high school.

--- Andrew T:
Oh, God.
That is depressingly true.

--- Robert Evans:
I want to quote now from a section of Diane Ravitch's book,
Reign of Error, 
which is a pretty good title
for a book about, you know,
problems in the education system.
Many studies show that charters enroll
a disproportionately small share of students
who are English language learners
or who have disabilities
as compared with their home district.
A survey of expulsion rates in the District of Columbia
found that the charters,
which enroll nearly half of the student population
of the district expel large numbers of children.
The charter's expulsion rate is 72 times
the expulsion rate in public schools.
As the charter shun those students,
the local district gets a disproportionately large number
of the students who are most expensive
and most challenging to educate.
When public students leave for charters,
the budget of the public school shrinks,
leaving them less able to provide a quality education
to the vast majority of students.
It's fucking segregation.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Dressed up as fixing the education system
by removing black and white kids from each other
and then defunding the schools that black kids go to
because they got kicked out of the schools

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
the white kids are going to.
it's cool though

--- Andrew T:
it's also
It always winds up that way.
Just so happens.

--- Robert Evans:
Gosh, gee shucks.
How does this country founded on white supremacy and genocide?
Keep doing white supremacy and genocide.
Gosh darn it.

--- Andrew T:
Who would have thought?

--- Robert Evans:
Who would have thought?
In 2008, Gates embarked on another program
to apply his market logic to education.
He put more than a billion dollars
into reforming low income and minority schools.
The basic idea was that they develop a set of metrics
to evaluate teachers with the goal of retaining good ones
and reshaping or removing bad ones.
Over the course of seven years,
there was no evidence that this program
helped schools hire better teachers.
They just burnt a billion dollars not doing anything.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
A RAND study showed no evidence of impact on student outcomes
from a write-up in Business Insider, quote
The study concluded that the initiative fared poorly
because the schools got better over time
at implementing measures of teacher effectiveness
rather than using those measures
to actually improve student outcomes.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
They taught to the test, but for teachers.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
In his view, the Gates Foundation initiative
appears to have generally done more harm than good.
It cost a fortune, Green writes.
It produced significant political turmoil
and distracted from other more promising efforts.
And when it comes to the Gates Foundation,
that right there is often the issue
as much as any sort of like mustache twirling evil.
Like 
sometimes it is like,
I'm gonna circumcise all the black people.
But a lot of times it's just like,
oh, well, 
let's make like provide incentives to make teachers better.
And then huge amounts of resources go into
making teachers pass a test
that a guy who doesn't know anything
about teaching help design.
And so a lot of effort is wasted
that could have gone to actually helping kids,
but instead has gone to making things,

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
making it, yeah, anyway.
And yeah, 
it's 
because Gates pours so much money
into public health and education.
His opinion is often the only opinion that matters.
So if he has a bad idea, 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
that bad idea gets a huge amount

--- Andrew T:
it has to be taken seriously

--- Robert Evans:
It has to be taken seriously.
Better ideas get ignored and effort gets wasted.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Here's another example of that.
Starting in 2000, when his foundation was new,
Bill Gates decided the big program with American education
was that our schools were too big.
The whole system needed to be disrupted.
Large schools had to be broken up.
More smaller schools had to be created.
He poured $2 billion into this program
over the next nine years,
which impacted fully 8% of the nation's public high schools
from a write-up in Politico.
So without a great deal of thought,
one school district after another signed on to the notion
that large public high schools should be broken up
and new smaller schools should be created.
This was an inherently messy process.
The smaller schools,
proponents sometimes called them academies,
would often be shoehorned into the premises
of larger schools.
So you'd end up with two or three or more schools
competing for space and resources in one building.
That caused all sorts of headaches.
Which schools would get to use the science labs or the gyms?
How would the cafeterias be utilized?
And who was responsible for policing the brawls
among students from high rival schools?

--- Andrew T:
right right
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
The program, it's just such a dumb idea.
And like I went to, 
I graduated in 2006.
The year I graduated,
my school was the largest graduating class
in U.S. history.
And it was the largest the next year too.
And the next year, Plano schools are massive.

--- Andrew T:
right right

--- Robert Evans:
Some of the largest schools in the world,
like high schools,

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
like 2000 people was my graduating class,
something like that.

--- Andrew T:
jesus
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
They're really good schools
like they're
Nationally, some of the best schools in the country,
obviously Plano has a lot of money.
Part of why, 
but like it doesn't,
the fact that they're huge
does not make them worse schools.

--- Andrew T:
right right
It's simply irrelevant.

--- Robert Evans:
it's simply irrelevant
Now you can argue class size might matter,
but you can have small classes in a huge school.
It's fine.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah 
it's just fucking.
And yeah, Gates himself admitted in 2008
that this program was a huge failure.
Tens of thousands of U.S. students
had their educations disrupted
because a billionaire had a bad idea.
And basically no one in the media covered
the fact that this had flopped.
Why would you?
The Gates Foundation was doing
another dozen dazzling things
that they were going to cover,

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
not the fact that like, boy,
it seems like a lot of their stuff doesn't work.
Also, they're circumcising millions of black people

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
and it's causing AIDS to get more deadly.

--- Andrew T:
But also they underwrite NPR.
so

--- Robert Evans:
But they do underwrite NPR.

--- Andrew T:
Well, yeah.
So it's like, right?
Yeah, that's a significant chunk of the media.

--- Robert Evans:
yeah

--- Andrew T:
Why?

--- Robert Evans:
Yep.
Yeah.
Now, the sheer amount of shit
Bill and Melinda Gates have gotten up to over the last 20, 21 years,
we're leaving out a lot.
We could talk more about standardized testing.
We could talk more about his agricultural reform in Africa,
which really we ought to.
But we've still got to talk about COVID vaccines and Jeffrey Epstein.
So we're moving on.

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
Let's talk about Bill Gates's sex life next.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, let's please.

--- Sophie:
Yeah, that's the first.

--- Robert Evans:
But first, let's ask the question on everyone's mind.
Is he a grower or a shower?

--- Sophie:
God, 

--- Robert Evans:
look, Sophie,
I get paid the big bucks to ask the hard questions, OK?
Like, how hard 
how hard does he get like?

--- Sophie:
And I don't get paid enough to have to listen to that.
So it's 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah, honestly,
Bill Gates doesn't get paid enough to have to listen to that.
Oh, products.

====== ads ======

--- Robert Evans:
All right, so we're back and we're talking about
Bill Gates is 
Bill Gates is Chungus,
I think is the technical term for what he has.

--- Sophie:
I hate that.
ew

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, yeah.
Anyway, it's probably not going to surprise anybody
to learn that Bill never got better at flirting
despite being one of the wealthiest people to ever exist.
He did grow more successful at having sex,
largely because he was one of the wealthiest people to ever exist.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
His primary horning ground was Microsoft 
and the Gates Foundation.
Now, earlier, we discussed how he met his wife while he was her boss.
Well, he met a lot of women in that way,
in the biblical way, while he was their boss.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
In 1998, Wendy Goldman-Rome wrote a book titled The Microsoft File,
where she claimed Gates had frequent affairs with employees.
She alleged he'd started dating a sales manager
in their German office before he even started seeing Melinda.
Gates met this woman at a Microsoft corporate meeting in Monte Carlo.
He sent her an email after saying that seeing her energized him and adding,
I hope I didn't stare or anything.
Gates canceled his flight back to the US to flirt with her.

--- Andrew T:
oh

--- Robert Evans:
He sent her love letters and the two embarked on a brief affair,
even though this woman was, by her own admission,
uncomfortable sleeping with her boss.

--- Sophie:
wow

--- Robert Evans:
Now, we now know this was a pattern for Bill.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
In 2006, he attended a presentation by a female Microsoft employee.
When he left the meeting, he emailed the woman to ask her out to dinner,
writing, 
If this makes you uncomfortable, pretend it never happened.

--- Andrew T:
But OK, I mean, 
yeah, 
I just don't understand.
It is simply a power.

--- Robert Evans:
i mean

--- Andrew T:
Why? 
Why do you need to do this?

--- Robert Evans:
I don't know 

--- Andrew T:
to your fucking employees.

--- Robert Evans:
He's not. 

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
it's not.
It's not a Weinstein thing.
He's not doing that 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
because we I've not heard any evidence that he
like, obviously, 
there's a power imbalance to discuss here,
but I haven't heard any of it. 

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
He's not like he's not raping employees.
I've never heard any allegations of that.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
And in this case, 
he senselessly is letter saying like, Hey, let's go to dinner.
I'm a married billionaire.
But if I 
this makes you uncomfortable, 
let's just pretend it never happened.
And she did. 
She decided she was uncomfortable.
She ignored the email and Gates did not pursue her further.
I haven't heard allegations 
that he harmed her career in any way.
I don't think he's doing that.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Like, I don't think he's penalizing women who don't get with him.
That said, I think it's pop.
You could argue that like this woman in Germany 
may have gotten with him
because she was like, maybe it'll hurt my career to not get with him.
Right. 

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
It doesn't matter as much if he did it as he's the CEO 

--- Andrew T:
it's wether it's stated.
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Yeah. 

--- Robert Evans:
A year or so later, Gates was on a business trip
on behalf of the Gates Foundation.
This is in like 2007, 2008.
He was traveling with a female employee during a cocktail party.
He whispered to her, I want to see you.
Will you have dinner with me?
The woman said she felt uncomfortable and laughed to avoid responding
from a write up in the New York Times, quote, 
six current and former employees of Microsoft, 
the foundation and the firm that manages Gates Fortune said
those incidents and others more recently at times created an uncomfortable
workplace environment.
Mr. Gates was known for making clumsy approaches to women in and out
of the office.
His behavior fueled widespread chatter among employees 
about his personal life. 
Some of the employees said that while they disapproved of Mr. Gates's behavior,
they did not perceive it to be predatory.
They said he did not pressure women to submit to his advances for the sake of their careers, 
and he seemed to feel that he was giving the women space to refuse his advances.
So, again, we're not talking 

--- Andrew T:
right
like technically, technically, yes,
but what are you talking 

--- Robert Evans:
it's not a Weinstein thing, but it's not OK.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah. 

--- Robert Evans:
Right.

--- Andrew T:
yes

--- Robert Evans:
Like you can 
you can not be as bad as Harvey Weinstein, industrial rapist.
And your behavior is still unacceptable 
because all 
like a workplace is not a fucking nightclub.
If 
if Bill Gates had a history of hitting on women awkwardly in nightclubs,
whatever, like 
fine, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah you be like

--- Robert Evans:
everyone has the right to be to be like, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
hey, you want to fuck and then be told, no, 
you're not being bad about it.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
But this is a workplace.
These are his employees.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
He runs the company.

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
It's not OK.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
Again, it's yeah.
So 
he was also noted by his employees 
to be dismissive towards his wife, Melinda, 
sometimes speaking to her during foundation meetings in ways that made employees cringe.
On its own, 
I don't know if all of this would have merited inclusion in an episode
as packed as this one, right, 

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
compared to circumcising 12 million people and making an AIDS epidemic worse.
It's not on that level, 

--- Andrew T:
right right right.

--- Robert Evans:
But it all helps set the stage that leads us, 
as all things eventually lead, Andrew, 
to Jeffrey Epstein.

--- Sophie:
epstein

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 
Jeff Steen, 
Carly Rae, Jeff Steen.
That's a mashup of Jeffrey.

--- Sophie:
oh, don't do that to her
don't do that to her

--- Robert Evans:
I mean, 
he did say call me maybe, but then he also sexually trafficked teenagers.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, it was.
It's the maybe that was taken out.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Sophie:
I'm so sorry.
carly

--- Robert Evans:
Hey, I just met you and this is crazy.
But get in the car or I will have your life systematically destroyed.
It's time for you to be sexually trafficked 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
to the wealthiest men on the planet.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Sophie:
that was dark robert

--- Andrew T:
not as catchy 
not as catchy but

it's not catchy as the original.
But I think it 

--- Andrew T:
but not as 

--- Robert Evans:
I think it's got wings.

--- Andrew T:
There's something there.

--- Robert Evans:
We'll workshop this.
A whole album of Jeffrey Epstein themed pop songs.

--- Sophie:
we
We will not.

--- Robert Evans:
I mean, 
you could 
you could 
you could like what is it?
What is that?
What's her name?
The lady who wrote the song Monster?
That one will work.
um
Yeah, 
little red Corvette, Jeffrey Epstein's jet.
Babies grow up too fast

--- Andrew T:
yikes

--- Robert Evans:
because of the child sex trafficking.
That was the joke.
I just wanted to make sure.

--- Sophie:
yeah
continue
continue

--- Robert Evans:
So 
by the mid aughts, Bill Gates was clearly frustrated by in his marriage.
He was wealthy and powerful, 
but he had never enjoyed the kind of success
with young women that other billionaires seem to exhibit.
You know, 
you got Richard Branson like regularly jet skiing 

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
naked with super models,
which seems to be his hobby.
um
Bill Gates doesn't do that kind of thing.
And I think this frustrates him 
and he doesn't like he's clearly he's not personally
like he's not like 
enough of a predator or anything to like take it.
And for whatever reason, I don't know.
It's weird.
Like you think just Bill, just 
just pay sex workers to hang out with you.
You have the money.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
they'll be happy to.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
You can find some very nice sex workers who would love to
make you look like you're cool and sexy all the time.
You'd feel great and nobody would.
Nobody reasonable would complain about it.

--- Andrew T:
right, yeah, yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
Anyway, he gets frustrated and I think that his sexual frustration is like
that's like the bat signal to Jeffrey Epstein,
a billionaire who isn't getting laid as much as he wants.
Like 
Epstein could smell that shit from a mile away.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
He's like a shark.

--- Andrew T:
Right 

--- Robert Evans:
now, the two met 
Epstein and Gates meet in 2011,
which is three years after Epstein pled guilty to soliciting sex from a child.
So, 

--- Sophie:
right.

--- Robert Evans:
This is not a tie.
You can't argue.
I had no idea.
                                      49.23
--- Andrew T:
Right.

--- Sophie:
Very publicly known to.

--- Andrew T:
oh god

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 
I'm going to quote from the New York Times here.
Mr. Epstein and Mr. Gates first met face to face 
on the evening of January 31st, 2011 at Mr. Epstein's townhouse 
on the Upper East Side.
They were joined by Dr. Eva Anderson Dubin, 
a former Miss Sweden who Mr. Epstein had once dated 
and her 15 year old daughter, Dr. Anderson Dubin's husband, 
the hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin,
was a friend and business associate of Mr. Epstein's.
The gathering started at eight and lasted several hours.
According to Miss Arnold, Mr. Gates's spokeswoman, 
Mr. Epstein subsequently boasted about the meeting and emails to friends and
associates.
Bill's great.
He wrote in one reviewed by the Times.
Mr. Gates, in turn, praised Mr. Epstein's charm and intelligence 
emailing colleagues. The next day, he said, 
a very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by
and I ended up staying there till quite late, 
which 

--- Andrew T:
ohh

--- Sophie:
ohh

--- Robert Evans:
why would you why would you mention that?
Why would you phrase it that way?
Bill, that's 

--- Andrew T:
on your work email, 

--- Robert Evans:
on your work email 

--- Andrew T:
jesus christ

--- Sophie:
bill

--- Robert Evans:
to Epstein.
Bill was the ultimate whale, 
a wealthy man child who could be separated 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
from some of his money in exchange for access to women.
Epstein pitched Gates an idea for a charitable fund 
seeded by Gates Foundation money and donations by other rich guys he knew.
So Epstein's like you put in a bunch of money.
I can get 
we could make like 
we can make like tens of billions of dollars
we could raise to do 
to make a huge charity fund.
And of course, Epstein's proposal included a suggestion that he be paid
point three percent of whatever money he raised, which would, of course, be
tens of millions of dollars for him.

--- Andrew T:
god

--- Robert Evans:
Now, the good news is that Bill hires smart people 
and the people who run his foundation that he sent to meet with Epstein 
spotted him as a con man immediately.
They're like, well, this guy's full of shit and a grifter like 
we shouldn't get involved with him.
But Bill remained fascinated with Epstein.
He visited Epstein's mansion at least three times.
He's on his plane.
I think he went to the island.
At one point, he emailed colleagues.
I don't know.
Maybe, maybe.
I don't know.
I could probably have looked that up, but I'm a hack and a fraud.
But at one point, Epstein emailed colleagues.
His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing, 
although it would not work for me 
when questioned about what this meant after Epstein's death.
Gates claimed he was referring to the decor of Jeffrey's Mansion.

--- Andrew T:
jesus

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, that's that's what you meant, buddy.
Yeah, 
Bill apparently talked about his own happiness in his marriage with Epstein.
And to be frank, we don't know the precise dimensions of their relationship.
We don't know what Bill did or did not get up to with Epstein.
We don't have 
conclusive information about any of that, 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
which is why probably going to get us in trouble to title this podcast 
Bill Gates sex offender.

--- Andrew T:
Right.

--- Robert Evans:
And also sex offender 

--- Andrew T:
yeah 
for sure

--- Robert Evans:
Bill Gates, the dick chopping sex offender of Epstein's Island, 
something like that.

--- Andrew T:
You're getting closer.
You're getting warmer

--- Robert Evans:
sophie
sophie put a pin in that one.

--- Sophie:
i will not

--- Andrew T:
Business affairs is ears are perking out now.
Now you're negotiating.

--- Robert Evans:
i mean
The actual fact of the matter is we cannot ever include circumcision in a title
because that immediately makes it a hot spot for the kind of arguments you do not want to get involved in.

--- Sophie:
fair enough

--- Robert Evans:
Don't ever say circumcision on the Internet.
That's all I'm going to say on the matter.

--- Andrew T:
wow

--- Robert Evans:
It immediately goes off the rails 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
like it's 
like it's 
like talking about Palestine like, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah, yeah, yeah, 
it's hard to have the
conversation in any.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah.
So yeah, again, we don't know exactly what Bill did with Epstein.
We know Melinda did meet with Epstein and Bill on one occasion.
Like she and Bill met Epstein and she has claimed that this like event still haunts her.
I think it was in 2013 and she seems to have gotten increasingly furious about Bill's relationship with Epstein after 2013.

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
In 2019, she started talking to advisors about divorcing her husband.
And that's more or less where we are now.
Just a few weeks before this episode was recorded, 
Microsoft corporate board members decided Bill Gates needed to step down from the board while they pursued an investigation into an inappropriate relationship he may have had with a female Microsoft employee.
Gates claims the decision to transition off the board was purely due to his desire to spend more time with on philanthropy.
And this, I think, brings us to the last bit of our journey
through the life of Billiam Gates, his role in the COVID-19 pandemic and the current intellectual property status of its most successful vaccines.
So, yeah, 
this is that part of it, right?
It is 19 pages to get to COVID.
19 pages and a surprising number of circumcisions.

--- Andrew T:
Right on time.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, way, way more circumcisions than I anticipated initially.

--- Andrew T:
I was going to 
if you'd 
if you'd asked me to wager the start,
I would have said zero

--- Robert Evans:
yeah
how many millions of circumcisions do you
think are going to be involved in the story?
You probably would not have said 12.
I think that's fair.
Now, the first Gates Foundation initiative geared towards
fighting the plague was actually rather modest.
On March 11th, 2020, two days before the WHO declared a
pandemic, the foundation started what they called the therapeutics accelerator, a joint initiative with MasterCard and a charity called the Welcome Trust to identify and develop treatments to the virus.
And again, 
as far as I could tell, I think MasterCard's only role in this is because it'll make them look good.
Right.
Like, well, we'll have Microsoft involved.
That'll be good for their image.

--- Andrew T:
god yeah
Why is MasterCard crazy?

--- Robert Evans:
MasterCard.
Why?
Well, you know, 
you know, we've all been seen like a car accident happen.
And the first thing an injured person cries out for is MasterCard.

--- Andrew T:
MasterCard, 

--- Robert Evans:
you know, sometimes visa shows up and it's just a real tragedy.
I always keep a MasterCard in my emergency kit.
The fuck.

--- Andrew T:
god

--- Robert Evans:
But what this means is that from the beginning, Gates placed burnishing the public image of a finance company 

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
on equal footing with actual virology in April of 2020,
with the entire country locked the fuck down and the virus just beginning to bite.
Bill Gates launched the COVID-19 act accelerator.
This program was geared towards organizing the research, development, manufacture and distribution of treatments and vaccines.
Like everything the Gates Foundation funds, this was a public-private partnership based around using charity to entice corporations to do the right thing by making it profitable.
This was one of a number of programs all geared at funding vaccine research.
But unlike most of those, 
the accelerator was from the start focused on respecting the exclusive intellectual property claims of whoever won the vaccine race from a right up in New Republic.
It's explicit arguments that intellectual property rights won't present problems for meeting global demand or ensuring equitable access and that they must be protected even during a pandemic carried the enormous weight of Gates's reputation as a wise, beneficent and prophetic leader.
As vaccine research proceeded, a lot of people suggested that when one was developed, the recipe should basically be open source so that any country with the capacity could make it without paying to license it.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
Gates fought against this. 
COVAX, which is the largest arm of his COVID response organization, proposed instead that poor countries should have vaccines donated to them by rich countries who would fund this through vaccine sales in wealthier countries.
It was hoped that this would vaccine.
This was not to vaccinate all of them.
This was to vaccinate about 20% of people in low to middle income countries.
After that, those governments would have to bid and compete on the open market for access to vaccines.
So 
one side of this is saying the vaccine should be open source and equally available to everybody to be manufactured everywhere for as close to free as is
humanly possible.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
And Bill Gates says, what if instead we do it for money and we donate 20% of the necessary vaccines to poor people?

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 
they'll 
they'll never learn.
They'll 
they'll never learn how to teach themselves how to stay alive unless we make them work for it.

--- Robert Evans:
It's like an EMT.

--- Andrew T:
And us stay alive, by the way.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah.
You have like three gunshot wounds and EMT like shows up and like bandages one of them and then says,
well, if I if I handle the rest for you, 
you're never going to learn how to bandage your own gunshot wounds.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
So I'm going to 
if you 
if you can pay for the gauze,
like I'll let you fix yourself 
again.
You take his big picture logic about health care and apply it to an actual health problem.
And it's immediately nonsense.

--- Andrew T:
right

--- Robert Evans:
It's just very clearly a bad idea.
But because you're talking about the big picture, people think he's smarter.
Now, many people warned that his ideas were horrible and that by fighting against the idea of a people's vaccine, he was essentially saying it was fine
for people to die to protect the concept of intellectual property.
Manuel Martin, a policy adviser for Doctors Without Borders, has since said that people in the Gates administration were central in pushing a global line that, quote, IP is not an access barrier in vaccines.
Of course, the only reason to have IP is to make an access barrier.
That's all it is.
A hundred percent of IP is about reducing access.
That's the only reason for it to exist.
Which is not to say there's zero thing like 
obviously, 
like I'm 
like, I'm not going to like.
But it's like there's zero reason for the kind
of IP that he wants to exist.
Like, obviously, 

--- Andrew T:
in that way, 

--- Robert Evans:
like, and it's
obviously it always winds up like it's one.
It would be one of those things if like, I don't know, the people who invented the Avengers and Superman and stuff got to make money off of their things instead of these gigantic syndicates using IP law to 
anyway.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
everything Disney does, like fuck all of this shit is what I'm saying.
Like, I believe in the ability of an artist to have control over their art, obviously.
And for the record, 
I think that if you're a 
I think for 
I think, for example, one of the things we as a society could do is 
when we have a global pandemic and an international team of heroic researchers creates vaccines in record time.
Maybe we should make sure none of them ever have to worry about anything financial for the rest of their lives.
Like, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
maybe that's a thing we could do as a planet.
Yeah.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.
Actual Tony Stark happened, and yet we couldn't manage to do anything good.

--- Robert Evans:
Well, it's because the people who did the amazing thing weren't Tony Starks.
They were international teams of very dedicated researchers whose names most
people will never know and also shouldn't know because they'll get assassinated
by lunatics.

--- Andrew T:
yeah and there is no tony stark
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
and there is no Tony Starks.
Well, Tony Stark is the one saying 
this thing other people invented should be profitable to a group of people separate from the people who invented it and other.
It's worth human death for this to be the way it works.
And again, when it comes to IP, if you're talking about like a novel or like Mickey Mouse or whatever, right,
we can argue about how like bad it is culturally.
But it's at its worst modest harm, because again, you're talking about Mickey Mouse.
When we're talking about vaccines, you're literally talking about
restricting who gets life saving medicine.
That's what IP protections are for vaccines is a restriction on whose
life gets saved.
James Love is the founder and director of Knowledge Ecology International, a think tank that studies the pharmaceutical industry and IP.
He's been involved in global public health policy as long as Bill Gates and has analyzed his impact for quite a while.
He points out that at the start, there was a fight between a pooling approach
advised by groups like the WHO C tap, 
which basically would have said we should pool research.
Any research done anywhere in the world should be available to all researchers working on this program.
We should open source the entire process of research, the vaccine process, all of the studies into its effect.
All of this should be pooled together.
We should pull knowledge.
You may recognize this as exactly the same thing computer nerds were doing in the 1970s when Bill Gates wrote an angry open letter at them.
They were pooling their knowledge to improve a thing.
Bill Gates got really fucking angry.
And of course, when this happened with a vaccine, Bill Gates fought like a devil against it.
Quote, 
things could have gone either way, says love, but Gates wanted exclusive rights maintained.
He acted fast to stop the push for sharing the knowledge needed to make the products, the know how, the data, the cell lines, the tech transfer, the
transparency that is critically important in a dozen ways.
The pooling approach represented by C tap included all of that.
Instead of backing those early discussions, he raced ahead and signaled support for business as usual on intellectual property by announcing the act accelerator in March.
And how did Gates's public-private partnership work?
One year later, his act accelerator has completely failed in its goal of providing discounted vaccines to the priority fifth of the world's
poorest people.
The drug companies and wealthy nations that supported his plan have all made bilateral agreements that basically said fuck poor countries.
As Peter Houghton's, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine said, the low and middle income countries are pretty much on their own and there's just not much out there.
Despite their best efforts, the Gates model and its institutions are
still industry dependent.
Now, the act accelerator is also technically part of the WHO, but it is funded, managed, and staffed mostly by Gates Foundation people.
It has ensured that, globally, rich countries and respect for intellectual property have been prioritized over human lives.
From New Republic, quote, 
companies partnering with COVAX are allowed to set their own tiered prices.
They are subject to almost no transparency requirements and to toothless contractual nods to equitable access that have never been enforced. 
Crucially, the companies retain exclusive rights to their intellectual property.
If they stray from their Gates Foundation line on exclusive rights, they are quickly brought to heel.
When the director of Oxford's Jenner Institute had funny ideas about placing the rights to its COVAX-supported vaccine candidate in the public domain, Gates intervened.
As reported by Kaiser Health News, a few weeks later, Oxford, urged on by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, reversed course and signed an exclusive vaccine deal with AstraZeneca that gave the pharmaceutical giant sole rights to
no and no guarantee of low prices.
So. 
Yeah.

--- Andrew T:
It's so weird to I mean, I guess that's how you control a market is make sure everyone thinks that the same like by the same rules you want, but it's like, well, who gives a shit if someone else gives away their property?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
their intellectual property.
But obviously, I'm being a.

--- Robert Evans:
It's it's, you know, again,
I keep going back to Jonas Salk, one of humankind's greatest heroes who when asked if he was going to patent the polio vaccine said you might as well patent the sun to which Bill Gates responded.
That's actually a pretty good idea.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you did you?
Are you working on that?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
that's right.
That's exactly the kind of thing.
So he would have strong arm Jonah Salk into not do it.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, he would.
He would have.
He would have not have not listened to Jonas about that shit.
Gates can hardly disguise his contempt for the growing interest in intellectual property barriers.
In recent months, as the debate has shifted from the WHO to the WTO, reporters have drawn testy responses from Gates that harken back to his prickly performances before congressional antitrust hearings a quarter century ago.
When a fast company reporter raised the issue in February, she described Gates raising his voice slightly and laughing in frustration before snapping.
It's irritating that this issue comes up here.
This isn't about IP.
But it is about IP.
There is very little real disagreement among epidemiologists here.
Gates's own arguments have been petulant and childish.
He has suggested, for example, that India, which makes more vaccines than any other country, can't be trusted to safely manufacture its COVID-19 vaccines.
He has called advocates of poor countries spoiled, telling Reuters
it's the classic situation in global health where advocates all of a sudden want the vaccine for zero dollars and right away.
We paid for this with public money, Bill, 
it should be free because the plague sucks.
Like, 
God damn it.

--- Sophie:
Hello, 

--- Robert Evans:
Bill.

--- Andrew T:
This is the only way this comes to a stop.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, you don't even have to have the fucking like anarchist altruist,
you know, human positive at it.
You just be like, well, I want it to be free because I want to go back to bars like
I want to be able to drink in a bar,

--- Andrew T:
yeah yeah

--- Robert Evans:
give away the vaccine. 
I want to go on vacation to Mexico, give everyone the vaccine for free.
Like there's a selfish way to justify this too,

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
but it's amazing.
When he has been challenged that his capitalist approach
to vaccinating the world is dumb and evil,
especially since the vaccines were developed largely with public money,
including 10 years of publicly funded mRNA vaccine research that made up the entire underpinning of these vaccines,
he has responded with snide comments about socialism saying 
North Korea doesn't have that many vaccines as far as we can tell.
This is true.
I think James Love probably put it best.
If you said to an ordinary person, we're in a pandemic.
Let's figure out everyone who can make vaccines and give them everything they need to get online as fast as possible.
It would be a no brainer, but Gates won't go there.
Neither will the people dependent on his funding.
He has immense power.
He can get you fired from a UN job.
He knows that if you want to work in global public health, you'd better not make an enemy of the Gates Foundation by questioning its positions on IP and monopolies.
And there are a lot of advantages to being on his team.
It's a sweet, comfortable ride for a lot of people.
The good news is that it does look like Bill Gates is more on the losing side
of this issue than the winning one.
Biden has recently somewhat reluctantly committed to a more open approach to sharing vaccines and vaccine ingredients.
Gates himself has partly walked back his own commitment to an IP-focused vaccine rollout after massive backlash.
But for a lot of dead people, the damage is done already.
No one should be surprised about the toxic impact Gates has had on the COVID-19 rollout and public health in general.
He has been extremely consistent his entire life from his first letter
to the computer hobbyist community to the corpse fires burning in the streets of the global South.
This is what you get when you let one man born to the most inconceivable privilege of perhaps any human in history
make life and death decisions for billions of strangers.
Anyway, 
I don't like Bill Gates a lot.

--- Sophie:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
I 

--- Sophie:
no
not into it.

--- Andrew T:
It's so common, though.
I will just say 
I think this is
this is as far as the planet goes and, 
you know, his peers go.
This is might be the least bastardy bastard we've done.
I've done some of the most bastardy bastard.

--- Sophie:
I mean, to be fair, 
King Leopold.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, you've done.
He's definitely I mean,
but it's also a question of
King Leopold's death toll.
Well, 
I mean, you can argue to a degree
like the violence that's ongoing in the Congo.

--- Andrew T:
sure

--- Robert Evans:
Some of the time to him.

--- Andrew T:
No, the numbers.

--- Robert Evans:
We don't know how many people Bill Gates is impact are going to die as a result
of the impact he's had on global health.
And it might be in net live save, to be honest,
because of the fucking malaria shit.
But like 
it's 
it's 
it's hard.
He's done so much.
It's really difficult to parse out.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.

--- Robert Evans:
He's 

--- Andrew T:
I think, though, 
it is
it is a little bit that history of, you know, 
is it great men or is it forces thing?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
because I will say
the evil Bill Gates has done
would easily have been done by someone else.
In fact, actively,
there are other people pursuing,
you know, that sort of like benevolent, but market driven,
just like any American billionaire.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
I mean, is a candidate to do precisely what he's done.

--- Robert Evans:
but Bill Gates is the one who did it.

--- Andrew T:
Who did?
no of course
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
and it's 
it's the so
it's the kind of thing where,
yes, this is a system problem.
The system failure 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
is that he accumulated enough money to be able to do this

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
as opposed to that money going into taxes
and then maybe us deciding as a nation.
Well, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
let's provide aid to other countries to build up
their health care infrastructure.

--- Andrew T:
or at least a resemblance of a vote on it.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
yeah.

--- Andrew T:
I guess I would just say any American billionaire
would almost by definition 
have the lack of perspective.

--- Robert Evans:
Yes, yes

--- Andrew T:
in a very similar way to Bill Gates 

--- Robert Evans:
absolutely

--- Andrew T:
that that his
his actions, I guess, seem inevitable.
Had had he been hit by a bus?
Had he fallen off the mountain?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
the other guy could easily be

--- Robert Evans:
kent
kent would have done this.
The fucking briefcase boy would have would have been this person.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
if it hadn't been Bill.

--- Andrew T:
I guess that's what I what 
I mean is like 
this.
This feels like less
like specifically Bill unique bastard dumb.
That's going to be my argument on this.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
they're all.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, I mean, yes, yes.
The answer is the actual bastard here
is a system that lets individuals
accumulate billions of dollars.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, they do this

--- Robert Evans:
by 
by commodifying every single thing,
even though the only reason they were able to make those money is 
that money is because a lot of nicer people didn't commodify cool shit
in order to make it better.
And 

--- Andrew T:
yeah, 
it's 
it's
it's truly this like 
thinking they 
they did it on their own.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, 

--- Andrew T:
it that like
that's the lack of perspective.

--- Robert Evans:
I think what's important about the Bill Gates story
is covering things like, 
OK,
well, because people are sharing and trading software for free,
first off, it helps it creates the industry he succeeds in
and then using his product for free and sharing it
creates the demand that allows him to get rich in the first place.
And he then makes what made him 
he makes this thing illegal, basically.
And he does that with everything his whole life.
This, you know, 
he 
he benefits fundamentally from the public sector,
from pooled resources of the community being invested in him.
And he takes that 
and turns that into personal wealth
and turns that into 
when he does give that away.
He only does it in whatever way he personally thinks is best
because all that matters is what Bill thinks.

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
And it is it makes it clear
covering this guy's story,
covering the story of the Homebrew Computer Club.
Those are the guys and talking about, 
you know,
the scientists using public money who developed these vaccines
that then became an engine for profit.
It makes it clear.
And what's important about this story because it's not just Bill,
these people are parasites.

--- Andrew T:
yes
they truly are

--- Robert Evans:
These people are parasites.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, 

--- Robert Evans:
that's what
that's what is happening here.
This is the story of a parasite
who got fat off of public investments that 
gave him an incredible opportunity,
which he then used to pull the rug out from under him
and circumcised 12 million people.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, yeah.
And then and then is like,
why are you mad at me for sucking all this blood?

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nobody else gets blood,

--- Andrew T:
yeah

--- Robert Evans:
but I'll give some away
for free to MasterCard.
God damn it.

--- Andrew T:
Oh, God, this is grim.

--- Robert Evans:
Yeah, it's it's fucking rad, dude.
You love to see it.
Well, Andrew.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah,

We went independent as a podcast,
so you can go to suboptimalpods.com
and find out how to get some of the premium content.
By the way, I should pitch
my favorite piece of premium content is
I am a person who I've like blocked by hand.
This is not with a block list,

--- Robert Evans:
That's amazing.
Andrew, that's incredible.

--- Andrew T:
$100, I will consider unblocking.

--- Robert Evans:
We stand a blocking king.
That's self-care.
I recently turned off notifications
for anyone I don't follow.

has improved my mental health more than that.
It's amazing.
I just don't see shit that other people post
if I don't like them already.
It's great.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
That's where I should be.

--- Robert Evans:
It is.
It's where we should all be anyway.
This has been behind the bastards.
Find Bill Gates in the street.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah.
But don't just stop at Bill Gates.
That's, I think, to me, the lesson

--- Robert Evans:
Loot the centers of capital
and distribute it to the people.

--- Andrew T:
Back to because we gave him,
we gave him the internet.
We gave him the idea for graphical user interfaces.
We did.

--- Robert Evans:
We did that.
So take his money and use it
to buy vaccines and rifles for the Global South.

--- Andrew T:
Yeah, it's your money.

--- Robert Evans:
I don't know.
It's the end of the episode.
All right.
