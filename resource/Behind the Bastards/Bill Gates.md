### Childhood
William Henry Gates, the third, 
was born on October 28th in Seattle, Washington, 
a town too rad for him to deserve.
His father was William H. Gates, senior, who used to be alive, but now is not that.
William Gates, senior, was a prominent corporate lawyer and a World War Two veteran.
His mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a girl boss and served on the board of directors for the first interstate bank system and the United Way.
His mom's dad had been the president of a national bank.

Religion was present, but doesn't seem to have been a huge factor in Bill Gates's childhood or in the Gates family childhood.
He had two siblings.
The family attended a Protestant reformed church.
Bill's parents hoped he would follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a law degree.
But from what I've read, they didn't put a lot of pressure on him to follow a specific path.
His family was close.
They played a lot of board games together.
Sunday dinner was at the same time every week, and they wore matching family pajamas.

So Bill Gates, senior, admitted in interviews in the 21st century
he was somewhat emotionally distant as a father.
And a number of folks have said this.
And it's kind of usually written as like, 
well, this is just sort of like a sign of the times, right?
Like he was a man.
He was a child of the of the 1920s.
He worked hard and he left most of the child rearing up to his wife.
He was serious and he talked to his kids like they were adults.
His oldest daughter later recalled he'd come home and he'd sit in his chair and eat dinner.
But there was never any kind of warm, give me a hug kind of thing.
Now, Bill's mom had been an athlete and an honor student, and she had extremely high standards for her kids.
This was less of a push your kids to follow a specific path thing and more of a you have to work hard and do your best at whatever you choose to do kind of thing, though.
She encouraged her children to try music and sports, even if they were bad at those things, because failure was a good experience to have.
And Bill was terrible at music, which 
same 
now
the Gates children were expected to dress nicely beyond and beyond time because both parents were members of high society.
They had to learn to socialize with prominent adults at an early age.
Bill followed his mother's guidance.
He was a voracious reader from an early age, and he read the World Book Encyclopedia series from beginning to end.

So his parents like that he was a big reader
and they would reward his hunger for knowledge 
by offering to buy him any book he wanted.
It should not be a surprise that he grew up super nerdy
and was bullied from an early age for being small and weird
and obsessed with books, which, you know, same 
I was
I was the kid who always had like a book underneath the 
the table and like math class.
I got in a lot of trouble for that shit. 

So obviously getting bullied 
caused him to withdraw further into his own little world.
And this started to worry his parents.
His dad attempted to counter this
by making young Bill work as a greeter at their parties
and as a waiter at professional functions for his law firm.

because his dad comes across as very reasonable in interviews,
like just an extremely reasonable man.
But then you realize like, 
OK, your kid was getting beat up in school.
So your solution was to make him be a waiter to rich people
because you thought that would help.

Now, most interviews will say that by age 11,
when it came to like intellect, Bill was more or less an adult.
We're not talking about maturity here,
but his ability to discuss international affairs and business.
And like generally, he was he was a very smart kid.
He was he was, you know, by the time he was 11 or 12,

His dad later recalled, quote,
it was interesting and I thought it was great.
Now, I will say to you, 
his mother did not appreciate it.
It bothered her 
and she was bothered because Bill's intellect
made him arrogant and led to clashes with his parents.
And I'm going to quote from the Wall Street Journal here.
The son pushed against his mother's instinct to control him,
sparking a battle of wills.
All those things that she had expected of him, 
a clean room,
being at the dinner table on time, 
not biting his pencils,
suddenly turned into a source of 
a big source of friction.
The two fell into explosive arguments.
He was nasty, 
his sister says of her brother.
Mr. Gates, senior, played the role of peacemaker.
He'd sort of break them apart and calm things down,
says the eldest sibling.
The battles reached a climax at dinner one night
when Bill Gates was around 12.
Over the table, he shouted at his mother in what today
he describes as utter, total sarcastic, smart ass kid rudeness.
His father responded by throwing a cold glass of water at his son's face,
to which his son responded sarcastically, 
thanks for the shower.
