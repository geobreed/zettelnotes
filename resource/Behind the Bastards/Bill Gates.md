### Childhood
William Henry Gates, the third, 
was born on October 28th in Seattle, Washington, 
a town too rad for him to deserve.
His father was William H. Gates, senior, who used to be alive, but now is not that.
William Gates, senior, was a prominent corporate lawyer and a World War Two veteran.
His mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a girl boss and served on the board of directors for the first interstate bank system and the United Way.
His mom's dad had been the president of a national bank.

Religion was present, but doesn't seem to have been a huge factor in Bill Gates's childhood or in the Gates family childhood.
He had two siblings.
The family attended a Protestant reformed church.
Bill's parents hoped he would follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a law degree.
But from what I've read, they didn't put a lot of pressure on him to follow a specific path.
His family was close.
They played a lot of board games together.
Sunday dinner was at the same time every week, and they wore matching family pajamas.

So Bill Gates, senior, admitted in interviews in the 21st century
he was somewhat emotionally distant as a father.
And a number of folks have said this.
And it's kind of usually written as like, 
well, this is just sort of like a sign of the times, right?
Like he was a man.
He was a child of the of the 1920s.
He worked hard and he left most of the child rearing up to his wife.
He was serious and he talked to his kids like they were adults.
His oldest daughter later recalled he'd come home and he'd sit in his chair and eat dinner.
But there was never any kind of warm, give me a hug kind of thing.
Now, Bill's mom had been an athlete and an honor student, and she had extremely high standards for her kids.
This was less of a push your kids to follow a specific path thing and more of a you have to work hard and do your best at whatever you choose to do kind of thing, though.
She encouraged her children to try music and sports, even if they were bad at those things, because failure was a good experience to have.
And Bill was terrible at music, which 
same 
now
the Gates children were expected to dress nicely beyond and beyond time because both parents were members of high society.
They had to learn to socialize with prominent adults at an early age.
Bill followed his mother's guidance.
He was a voracious reader from an early age, and he read the World Book Encyclopedia series from beginning to end.
