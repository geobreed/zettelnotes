### Childhood
William Henry Gates, the third, 
was born on October 28th in Seattle, Washington, 
a town too rad for him to deserve.
His father was William H. Gates, senior, who used to be alive, but now is not that.
William Gates, senior, was a prominent corporate lawyer and a World War Two veteran.
His mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a girl boss and served on the board of directors for the first interstate bank system and the United Way.
His mom's dad had been the president of a national bank.

Religion was present, but doesn't seem to have been a huge factor in Bill Gates's childhood or in the Gates family childhood.
He had two siblings.
The family attended a Protestant reformed church.
Bill's parents hoped he would follow in his father's footsteps and pursue a law degree.
But from what I've read, they didn't put a lot of pressure on him to follow a specific path.
His family was close.
They played a lot of board games together.
Sunday dinner was at the same time every week, and they wore matching family pajamas.

So Bill Gates, senior, admitted in interviews in the 21st century
he was somewhat emotionally distant as a father.
And a number of folks have said this.
And it's kind of usually written as like, 
well, this is just sort of like a sign of the times, right?
Like he was a man.
He was a child of the of the 1920s.
He worked hard and he left most of the child rearing up to his wife.
He was serious and he talked to his kids like they were adults.
His oldest daughter later recalled he'd come home and he'd sit in his chair and eat dinner.
But there was never any kind of warm, give me a hug kind of thing.
Now, Bill's mom had been an athlete and an honor student, and she had extremely high standards for her kids.
This was less of a push your kids to follow a specific path thing and more of a you have to work hard and do your best at whatever you choose to do kind of thing, though.
She encouraged her children to try music and sports, even if they were bad at those things, because failure was a good experience to have.
And Bill was terrible at music, which 
same 
now
the Gates children were expected to dress nicely beyond and beyond time because both parents were members of high society.
They had to learn to socialize with prominent adults at an early age.
Bill followed his mother's guidance.
He was a voracious reader from an early age, and he read the World Book Encyclopedia series from beginning to end.

So his parents like that he was a big reader
and they would reward his hunger for knowledge 
by offering to buy him any book he wanted.
It should not be a surprise that he grew up super nerdy
and was bullied from an early age for being small and weird
and obsessed with books, which, you know, same 
I was
I was the kid who always had like a book underneath the 
the table and like math class.
I got in a lot of trouble for that shit. 

So obviously getting bullied 
caused him to withdraw further into his own little world.
And this started to worry his parents.
His dad attempted to counter this
by making young Bill work as a greeter at their parties
and as a waiter at professional functions for his law firm.

because his dad comes across as very reasonable in interviews,
like just an extremely reasonable man.
But then you realize like, 
OK, your kid was getting beat up in school.
So your solution was to make him be a waiter to rich people
because you thought that would help.

Now, most interviews will say that by age 11,
when it came to like intellect, Bill was more or less an adult.
We're not talking about maturity here,
but his ability to discuss international affairs and business.
And like generally, he was he was a very smart kid.
He was he was, you know, by the time he was 11 or 12,

His dad later recalled, quote,
it was interesting and I thought it was great.
Now, I will say to you, 
his mother did not appreciate it.
It bothered her 
and she was bothered because Bill's intellect
made him arrogant and led to clashes with his parents.
And I'm going to quote from the Wall Street Journal here.
The son pushed against his mother's instinct to control him,
sparking a battle of wills.
All those things that she had expected of him, 
a clean room,
being at the dinner table on time, 
not biting his pencils,
suddenly turned into a source of 
a big source of friction.
The two fell into explosive arguments.
He was nasty, 
his sister says of her brother.
Mr. Gates, senior, played the role of peacemaker.
He'd sort of break them apart and calm things down,
says the eldest sibling.
The battles reached a climax at dinner one night
when Bill Gates was around 12.
Over the table, he shouted at his mother in what today
he describes as utter, total sarcastic, smart ass kid rudeness.
His father responded by throwing a cold glass of water at his son's face,
to which his son responded sarcastically, 
thanks for the shower.

the throwing water in his son's face
story is a story you'll find a lot written in articles about Bill,
particularly in the early 2000s.
Now, this is the period we're talking about, 
like how what led to this today.
But the early 2000s was when Bill started
kind of stepping away from Microsoft and into philanthropy.
And so there were suddenly a rush of articles like 
because he had been
I know 
people don't really know this.
We're going to be talking about why.
I think people who weren't, you know, 
super cogent during the 90s,
he was like the demon, the devil to a lot of people in the 90s.
And then throughout the aughts, 
he got really rehabilitated.
His image did because he went from like the evil overlord
of the megacorporation that was, you know, 

Bucking everything up to like the guy curing malaria, basically.

because it is a little hard to remember how pervasive Microsoft. 

And so this 
for whatever reason, when this like rush of articles came out,
kind of burnishing Bill's reputation in the early 2000s,
this story wound up on them a lot.
And they tended to portray this moment.
His dad throwing water in his face is like a turning point
for young Bill Gates, where he realized like, 
oh, I'm being an asshole.
And where his parents like 
when everything kind of like turned around for him and his family.
um
But I've 
I've run across other articles that were written
in a similar time period and were less of like shameless plugs.

Yeah.
And these articles make it clear 
that his behavioral problems went deeper than that.
And there was not as clean a break 
when they stopped 
as Gates and his family portray.

I found a Washington Post article 
that noted Bill spent so much time
in his room during his adolescence 
that his mom would buzz him on the house intercom 
to ask what he would do it was doing.
And he would shout back, 
I'm thinking, have you ever tried thinking?
So 
again, 
he's 
he's 
he's 
he's a real 
he's a real asshole about being smart.

Now, the fight made it clear to his father and mother
that things were getting out of control.
So they took him to a therapist.
Bill later recalls telling them, 
I'm 
telling the therapist,
I'm at war with my parents over who is in control.
The therapist told his mom and dad 
that their son was going to eventually win his struggle for independence.
So their best bet was to let him have his freedom now
and see how he handled it.
So that's what they did.
They took him out of his old school 
and they enrolled him in a private school, Lakeside Prep.
And the idea was that this school would give him more freedom
and that that would resolve his behavioral problems.
I don't know the extent to which it resolved his behavioral issues,
because I think he kept being a dick.

But he absolutely 
he loved the school.
And it was 
it's 
it's what made him 
going to this specific school is what made him into the man that he became.
And it's here, I should probably note that 
of all of the people I've studied in this series, 
Bill Gates is absolutely the luckiest.
I think he might have the most privileged upbringing
I have ever encountered.
And that includes like fucking kings.

Like in terms of like the time he was born,
the time he was raised, 
the resources his family had,
like not only 
but it's also 
like not only did they have money,
not only did he grow up in a time when like 
opportunity was exploding in this country, 
not only were his parents upper class,
but they were thoughtful and understanding

exactly 
that was
very few people 
are so like 
just comprehensively the luckiest man I've ever heard about.
He also lucked into a good therapist,
which people who have tried to find therapists can say is like
not a common thing, 
especially finding a therapist
whose answer to behavioral problems is going to be.
You just got to let your kid do his shit, you know?

Yeah, yeah, it's all good.
The it's all good approach.

Yeah, the it's all good approach.
And then he lucked into Lakeside Prep,
which, 
you know, 
not only was like a lot of rich kids go to fancy schools.
Lakeside Prep was not just a fancy school.
It was a school with a computer.

Now, Bill started there when he was 13 in 1968,
an era for which 99 percent of people, 
the term computer meant either some shit NASA uses 
or like sci fi nonsense.
Probably less than one percent of one percent of 13 year old boys
had meaningful access to computers in this time period.
And Bill Gates was one of them.

That's what I like.
Just staggeringly fortunate.

So the reason that Bill's school had a computer 
is that when he was in eighth grade, 
the Mother's Club at Lakeside held a rummage sale
and they used the profits from it 
to buy a teletype model 33 ASR terminal.
And they also rented a block of time on a general electric computer.
So Bill gets access to this machine 
because the mom's club at his school
is forward thinking enough to be like, 
we should probably get a computer
so these kids can 
like that seems like it might be the future.
And Bill is immediately obsessed with the machine.
He starts programming.
He starts creating new like 
languages and shit.
And he was so good at it, actually.
And this is another ridiculous stroke of luck.
He was so good at programming 
that his school said he no longer
had to go to math class 
so he could spend more time learning computers.
It's just like, my God.

Categorically, 
the luckiest boy who ever lived.

Yeah.
Now, when I say there are no self-made billionaires,
shit like this is why, 
because there's no way that Bill Gates
becomes the multi-billionaire he is today 
if he doesn't have both.
And this is like not like 
leaving out exploitation and stuff.
There's no way he becomes a billionaire 
if he doesn't have the privilege
and wild fortune to have access to this computer.
And like 
a lot of most rich kids didn't have this opportunity.
Bill benefited at an early age, 
not just from wealth and social privilege,
but from a wonderfully supportive community of moms
who had the farsight to buy a computer for their kids to use.
And a school that was progressive enough
to let him like 
spend his class time learning to program.
And Bill blossomed with all this additional freedom.
His dad later recalled that Bill realized, quote, 
Hey, I don't have to prove my position relative to my parents.
I just have to figure out what I'm doing relative to the world.
And Bill decided the thing he really wanted to do 
was get good at computers.
His first computer program was a tic tac toe game
he programmed that let users play against the computer.
He was not the only kid obsessed with the computer.
Two other boys, Paul Allen and Kent Evans, 
fell in love with this machine.
Paul Allen is one of 

is the Microsoft founder.
He died not too long ago, I think. 
Yeah.

in the 1960s hold a rummage sale.
And then the big domino is millions die of the coronavirus
because vaccine access is locked down.

So, yeah, Bill Gates gets real into computers
with Paul Allen and this other kid, Kent Evans.
Now, Kent Evans was Gates's early best friend.
He was a weird kid who carried a briefcase filled with business magazines.

Bill Gates is hanging out with the briefcase boy

and Kent pushes Gates 
credits that Kent is the guy like pushed him to think big 
and take risks and was like
like they were always talking about what they're going to be
some kind of businessman, 
some kind of politician.
So like he was he was an ambitious kid.
And together, Gates and Allen and another kid named Rick Wayland,
who was another Microsoft founder, 
started the Lakeside Programmers Club.
Now, 
despite the term club, this was not a hobby for them.
The goal from the beginning 
was to find ways to make money with computers.
I'm going to quote from the Washington Post here.
The club operated with minimal supervision.
This was by design, says Fred Wright,
the Lakeside math chairman who provided that supervision.
Our philosophy was get a group of smart people together,
give them tools and get out of the way.
Wright says, 
again, incredibly lucky.
That, he says, is the best environment to spur creativity,
competition and collaboration.
If you want to see the roots of Microsoft's culture,
look no further than the Lakeside Programmer Club, 
Kent's father says.
The four boys spent late night hours 
at Seattle's computer center Corp, C cubed, 
which offered time on a digital equipment corp machine 
per an agreement with Lakeside.
When C cubed went out of business in 1970,
the Lakeside Programmers Club nearly imploded in a civil war.
Gates and Evans agreed 
to buy a set of DEC tapes cheap in a bankruptcy auction
without the knowledge of their partners.
They hid the tapes in a room at Lakeside.
And when Alan learned of this, 
he found and kept them livid.
Gates and Evans threatened legal action.
They were 15.
So these kids are having like 
like corporate legal spats
as like 15 year olds 

over the secret computing machines they bought 
and hid from each other to keep and leg up on their teenage friends.

Yeah.
You're going to feel bad about that in a second.
So as their adolescence rolled on, Bill and Kent started
taking consulting jobs for local companies that had computers,
but no one who knew how to use them very well.
They would often work in exchange for free computing time.
In their junior year, a Lakeside teacher
hired them to automate the school's class scheduling system.
They did several all nighters to get the program ready.
Then on Memorial Day of that year, 
Kent took a break to go mountain climbing.
Now, he was not an athletic kid, 
but he had become he was, you know,
he was someone who was prone to like getting obsessed with things
and he had decided he's 
rather suddenly that he wanted to get
like good at physical tasks.
So he got into mountain climbing,
but he wasn't great at it.
And he slipped and fell to his death on May 28, 1978, 1972.
So his father later blamed the accident 
on the fact that Kent was too exhausted 
to pay attention on mountain climbing
because he'd been coding with Bill Gates all night.
And Gates told the Washington Post, 
I was devastated.
And he's been very consistent about the fact that like 
this was an incredibly traumatic thing. 
His best friend dies.
He was actually set to give a speech at Kent's funeral,
but he couldn't handle doing it.
It was just too emotional for him.
I'm sure this is true.
His now soon to be ex wife says that when she met him,
like 30 years later, 
he still talked about Kent all the time.
But I have to throw in this very odd quote he gave to Netflix
for a documentary when asked about Kent's death.
It was so unexpected, so unusual.
People didn't know what to say to me or to his parents.
I sort of thought, 
hey, OK, 
now I'm going to do all these things that we talked about, 
but I'll do it without him.
Like, that's 

that said 
clearly it was a weird kind of friendship
because they're engaging in like corporate espionage

with their other teenage buddies.
Like 
now with his best friend dead, 
Bill needed a new best friend
to stay up all night coding with 
one who wouldn't go mountain climbing.
He picked Paul Allen.
Paul was enrolled at the University of Washington,
but he would come back to finish the project with Gates
when he was on break from college.
Gates and Allen finished coding the program during Gates's senior year.
While he was still 17, 
he and Allen formed a company
called Traf o Data with with the goal of making traffic counting machines.
So they 
they're like they're doing businessy shit throughout this period.
Bill's last couple of years in high school.
But their collaborations weren't all professional.
During one of his breaks from college,
Allen helped Bill Gates do something creepy as hell.
And I'm going to quote from a write up in the cut.
When he was in high school, 
he and fellow Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen would hack into the school scheduling software
and sign Gates up for all girls classes 
to up his chances of getting a date.
Paul did the computer scheduling with me, Gates said.
Unfortunately for him, he was two years ahead of me
and he was off to college by then.
So I was the one who benefited 
by being able to have the nice girls at least sit near me.
It wasn't so that I could talk to them or anything, 
but they were there.
I think I was particularly inept at talking to girls or thinking, 
OK, do you ask them out? Do you not?
When I went off to Harvard, I was a little more sociable,
but I was still below average on talking to girls.

And it's 
it's so bizarre because like.
I mean, honestly, this is 
this is like some fucking Mark Zuckerberg shit, right?

you know, it really is.
It's the same basic idea.
Bills is from an earlier age.
He would have done the same thing.
Zuckerberg did 
that said 
it's also like he's too much of a nerd to take advantage of it.
He's just sitting in class with these girls.

It is a very like, you know, child of the 60s.

it's that kind of thing, 
which like if you haven't watched Revenge of the Nerds, 
it's a movie that 
it's like this silly movie about a bunch of nerds, 
you know, being the cool kids
and getting one over on the jocks at a college
that nobody thought anything was problematic about until.
I think about 10 years ago, 
everyone realized at the same time
that the main character literally rapes a girl.

Now, as that last quote made clear, 
Bill was accepted into Harvard
after 
after college, creeper not.
His grades and impressive computing resume made him a shoe in.
He started college in 1973 and he lived in a dorm house
that was filled with all of the math and science nerds
because even Harvard had standards.
They wanted to keep those kids away from the dorms
where kids were getting laid, basically. 

Now, during his sophomore year, Bill Gates met Steve Ballmer,
the future CEO of Microsoft 
and presently most famous 
for allegedly throwing chairs at employees during meetings. 

I can confirm from my time as a tech journalist 
that he smells like onions.
I don't know what he smelled like in college,
but I can confirm that in like 2010, 
he smells like onions.
Now, 
Balmer and Gates were opposites in a number of ways.
Steve was extremely involved in everything.
Bill was aggressively uninvolved in anything
but his own little world of computers.
That Washington Post article I quoted from 
includes a few interesting tidbits
like that both got perfect scores on their SATs 
and were obsessed with Napoleon.
There's probably something meaningful 
in the fact that Bill Gates loves Napoleon 
and Mark Zuckerberg loves Augustus Caesar.
You know, 
not a coinkie dink, but 
all right.

Yeah, no.
The only thing you should learn about is genocide.
We're throwing all of the statues into the sea.
Don't tell this kid about Hadrian. Yeah.
Now, the reports we have from Gates in college 
make it clear that he was
he was he was gross.
He didn't use sheets instead.
He slept directly on his dorm mattress 
because making his bed was too hard.
Um, Balmer did the same 
again.
All boys in college are gross.
I don't know. It's just funny to me.
Now, Gates's main extracurricular during college was poker,
which he was terrible at.
He lost so much money 
that he eventually gave Steve Balmer
his checkbook for safekeeping 
because otherwise he was going to lose all of his money 
getting his ass kicked at poker.
Now, while all this was happening, 
personal computing was in its infancy.
1974 marked the release of what a lot of people will call 
the first personal computer, the Altair 8080.
Now, Paul Allen, who at this point had graduated
and gotten a job at the Honeywell Corp, 
immediately rushed to Bill's dorm
with an ad for the for the Altair 8080.
He and Gates quickly wrote a letter 
to the computer's manufacturer, MITS,
asking if they could write software for it in basic.
MITS was like, yeah, sure.
You guys can like 
we'll pay you to write software
if you come up with software that's good.
But you better hurry 
because a shitload of people 
have actually been making the same offer to us.
Personal computing is kind of like 
starting to blow up in this period of time.
So both men basically dropped everything else in their lives
to move to Albuquerque, 
where MITS was headquartered
and write software for the first personal computer.
This meant Paul Allen quit his job at Honeywell 
and Gates dropped out of Harvard in his junior year in 1975 
to move to Albuquerque and start a company.
You might have expected this to have gone over poorly with his parents.
But again, 
Bill seems to have kind of hit the mom and dad lottery in a lot of ways.
When questioned about it decades later, his father said,
being a college dropout 
wasn't precisely what my wife and I had envisioned
for any of our children.
But Bill seemed to know what he was doing.
Very supportive family, this kid has, 
and he did know what he was doing.
You have to give the man credit for that.
Allen and Gates formed a consulting company 
to sell software to Altair.
They called it Micro Dash Soft.

Yeah. 
Let's make legally actionable claims about Sean Parker next
So Bill and 
Bill and Paul
hired friends of theirs to help them produce software,
including a kid named Monty Davidoff, 
who they had write a piece of software
that would allow computers to perform greater ranges of calculations.
The three all live together in a two bedroom apartment.
Davidoff slept on the living room floor in 2000.
He told The Washington Post that although they were friends,
Gates could be something of a dick.
Quote, there was definitely a supervisory dynamic.
Bill could get very loud.
If he felt you weren't getting something, 
he would say the same thing louder.
He liked strong interchanges.
I preferred not to work in that way.
Now, 
this is the period of time a lot of Microsoft stories come from,
you know, the scrappy upstarts on a shoestring budget,
building a globe spanning mega corporation from their living room
or their garage or whatever. 

The reality is that Gates was backed 
from the beginning by family money.
There was never any like 
there was a time when the company wasn't making much money, 
but there was never a period of time
when Gates was had any financial worries. 

Yeah. Davidoff worked for them for two summers,
and then they offered him a permanent job.
But he had to say no, 
because he couldn't afford to drop out of Harvard.
He told The Post 
that Bill Gates had only been able to drop out of Harvard 
to start his company 
because his family was rich.
Quote, the way Bill and I thought about money was very different.
He would tell all of his friends, 
just call me, collect.
He knew there was 
he knew he wasn't going to have to support himself coming out of college.
And the fact that Bill never ever in his whole life worried about money
in a meaningful way does not mean he wasn't obsessed with it.
In fact, his lust for profitability, 
depending on who you ask,
had a somewhat disastrous impact 
on the growing computing community.
In the early days, computing was, in fact, a community.
These were the days when any given computer was a DIY project.
Most personal computers like 
you would have to solder parts of it together
to like get it working 
or to add things like 
you're like using fucking tools and shit to like 
anyone who has a computer is doing this shit.
You're coding programs on like these weird paper things.
Like I couldn't write. 

it's it's very much DIY.
So it's actually not all that different 
from like the the the 3D printed gun community is today.

Like it's like everything is shared.
All of these programs are shared.
You don't pay money for them.
Usually you just like, 
oh, or if someone buys it, they then just
copy it and send it for free to their friends.
Like that's the way this stuff really works.
And computer hobbyists had a powerful sense of solidarity.
In the early days of Microsoft, 
Gates and Allen were selling software
to those hobbyists, 
only not everyone who used Microsoft software actually paid for it.
A lot of these people were poor.
You know, buying a computer was all they could afford to do.
So they weren't buying the software.
And there was a brisk open trade and free software 
from each according to their resources 
to everyone, according to their needs.
Microsoft programs were very popular with this set.
One expert later wrote hobbyists loved it.
They loved it so much, they were willing to send tapes,
paper tapes around to each other for free.
Now, this was critical in Microsoft's success
because it spread adoption of their products.
But it enraged Bill Gates 
that people were getting software for free.
In 1976, he penned an infamous open letter to computer hobbyists.
He accused them of all stealing, 
all of stealing his software
and said that resellers who sold computers with his programs
already on them were basically robbing them.
The letter included the line, 
hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share.
Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?
He's being very snotty about this.
Now, Gates complained 
that the time he and Alan spent to create their products 
was worth forty thousand dollars,
but that the royalties they received 
based on what they'd actually sold
meant they were just making about two dollars an hour.
This was, many will argue, 
a short sighted way of looking at things.
The share and share like mindset of early
software was a major driver of innovation.
It allowed different ideas about software 
to be merged and tested
and provided early programmers 
with a greater base of knowledge to work from
many of the brilliant minds behind the computer revolution.
Guys like Steve Wozniak benefited hugely 
from this state of affairs.
Like in the woz is someone who will say, like, 
yeah, that's why we have the computer systems that we have today 
is because in my day we were just able to like share everything.
and woz like 
like a punk side of this thing.
Like he's a phone freaker.
He's like doing back in the day, 
you could like make certain signals
over the phone that would get you free phone access and shit.
Like he was all into that.
Like fucking Steve Wozniak is actually pretty fucking rad.
When he got super rich off of Apple, 
he blew all of his money
holding a bunch of giant concerts and stuff 
like he's fucking cool, dude, actually. 
But Bill did not.
So Bill, you know, a lot of 
and again, Wozniak is one of those guys
that you really can't argue.
It was instrumental in the existence of personal computers,
as we know them today.
You can argue that about Bill Gates.
And he did not agree 
with guys like Steve Wozniak about intellectual property.
He felt that intellectual property rights 
trumped human progress any day of the week.
It didn't matter that sharing software was good for computing
because it was bad for Microsoft.
And so from that moment on, Gates dedicated himself
to making sure IP was kept sacrosanct.
Today, intellectual property rights and paid software
are such pillars of the industry that it can be hard to believe
this wasn't necessarily always going to be the case.
One thing that made Apple computer interesting in 1976
was the fact that their operating system, Apple Basic, was free.
And they openly claimed, quote, 
Our philosophy is to provide software
for our machines at free or minimal cost.
Now, there was significant fallout 
within the computing community over this open letter.
One hobbyist, Hal Singer, 
who published an influential newsletter,
complained that since Bill Gates had developed basic 
on a Harvard University computer funded by the U.S. government 
and the start of the Microsoft, 
like the first programs they make, 
they make in Harvard before they drop out.
The Harvard computer they make it on 
was paid for by DARPA,
like the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.
And so 
Hal Singer will say, like, 
well, he should never have been able
to sell my 
windows 

Yeah, 
it was 
it was developed using taxpayer funds, which is true.
This is a very defensible line of argument.
Now, 

I mean, it does 
it sounds like Bill Gates is the thing.
The philosophy of 
philosophy of his that has resonated
down is 
tech guys using public,
you know, either public research, public funded intellectual property,
public, whatever, 
thinking they own it and then not letting
and then getting mad when, you know, 
like 
like taking it,
taking from the common good 
and pretending they invented it.

Oh, we've been back.
So 
other people who knew Gates and Allen at the time
reposted his estimate that he and his colleagues had put
$40,000 into designing their software, right?
That's a big part of his argument on this open letter.
This is how much money it's cost us to make this.
We have to be able to make it back.
We can't afford to do this.
One member of the Homebrew Computer Club, Lee Felsenstein,
who 
Lee Felsenstein designed the first mass produced personal computer
later said, quote, 
Well, we all knew that 
the evaluation of computer time 
was the ultimate in funny money.
You never pay that much for the computer time.
And I think that research will show 
that they were using someone else's computer time. 
Someone else was paying for that.
It could have been Honeywell 
where Paul Allen was working.
So we all knew this to be a spurious argument.
So back in this day, 
you had to like pay in a lot of cases
for access to a computer, right?

And one of the things Bill gets in trouble with when he's a kid,
like he and his friends get kicked out of one of the places
because they're hacking the system 
to get free computer time.

They're using free computer time at the stamp.
They're almost certainly using Paul Allen's companies.
Freak like 
they're doing a lot of things they would call stealing.

And, you know, Felsenstein, again, it's
talks about like kind of the 
the injustices of the world.
Felsenstein is one of the most influential computing pioneers 
you never heard of.
And the reason that Gates is famous and Felsenstein isn't
has nothing to do with the fact 
that Gates did more to revolutionize the world.
It's not that he was like 
that much more influential than Felsenstein.
It's because Felsenstein was obsessed 
with pushing the boundaries of computing,
while Gates was obsessed 
with pushing the boundaries of how much money computing could make. 

Felsenstein later wrote that the open letter, quote,
delineated a rift between the actual industry 
where there's trying to make money
and there's where those 
those hobbyists where we're trying to make things happen.
So there's this rift that opens that Bill starts between
making money and making computers better.
Bill is not on the making computers better side. 

kind of the same same journey. 
Yeah.
So Lee, 
I'm going to read another quote from Lee Felsenstein here,
where he's just kind of explaining why Microsoft gets big
and what that has to do with this 
this homebrew computer culture that he hates.
Quote, the industry needs the hobbyists.
And this was illustrated by what happened eventually 
when National Semiconductor,
which made their own microprocessor chips in 77 or 78,
decided they needed a basic 
an operating system.
They asked, what's the most popular basic?
And the answer was Microsoft basic 
because everybody had copied it
and everybody was using it.
So we made Microsoft the standard basic.
National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license.
They were in business that way.
This was the marketing function.
And the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete
antipathy of the company in question.
There were other basics.
And, you know, some of them might even have been better.
Gates's later success was in a certain measure
because of what we did that he said we shouldn't do.
We were thieves to do it 
at all.
Like. 
That's important.
Is 
Bill is arguing that like, 
well, we can't be expected to do this for free.
Otherwise, you won't have innovation.
And it's like, well, 
the fact that people were sharing your program for free

is why you became a billionaire, 
because when companies started realizing
we need to pay for operating systems, 
what's the most popular one?
Oh, this one, because everyone's been sharing it for free.
Like, 

it's the argument about piracy, right?
It's the same thing as like, 
well, if people are able to share
movies and music and stuff for free, 
it doesn't hurt the industry.
It will actually bring them more fans 
who will spend money on those things
in other ways, which I think was borne out by what happened.

For a lot of things, for every 
for a lot of things that are covered by intellectual property, like, 

you know,
my boss, part of why I'm putting out my book for free
like there will be a print version and stuff.
I've got a publisher, but it's going to be available for free online.
Is it something my my boss, Jason Pargin, did back in the early 2000s
He just published his book online for free.
It became hugely popular.
And when you have something for free that, you know,
X number of people have consumed anyway,
there will be a way to monetize it.
Jason got made a lot of money off of that book eventually.
Like it's 
it works out in the same thing with Bill Gates.
Bill Gates made a shitload of money 
off of people using his shit for free.
That's kind of how intellectual property 
actually works most of the time.
But 
Bill Gates is a dick.
So 
one of the people who spends the most time slamming Bill Gates
and is the best at it 
because he's right about literally everything
is Corey Doctorow.
I fucking love Corey. 
He's 
he's 
he's rad.
And I found a really good interview with him on Jacobin,
where he goes into more detail 
on how Gates went from, quote,
another company making Altair software 
into a giant of the industry.
And he makes a similar argument to Felsenstein,
but he highlights Microsoft's deal with IBM is more crucial.
Quote, 
Gates gets his fortune 
because IBM had been subject to years of antitrust hell 
every year for 12 years.
IBM outspent the entire Department of Justice Antitrust Division 
fighting an antitrust claim.
Finally, under Reagan, they were let off the hook.
So IBM had spent years tied to the bumper of the DOJ.
And one of the things they knew 
that the DOJ really hated 
was monopolizing software by tying it to hardware.
So they made the PC and they made it out of commodity parts
so that it could be cloned.
They sat back as Phoenix Computing reverse engineered their ROM
and started selling it to Dell and Gateway and Compaq
so that there were compatible machines.
And they said, we're not going to make the operating system.
And they went to Bill Gates and Paul Allen 
and asked them to make a D
a DOS that they could use their machines 
so the DOJ would leave them alone.
So that's where Gates's fortune comes from.
He was in the right place at the right time.
And his mindset, 
this idea of cutthroat competition, of no sharing,
of no collegiality, 
allowed him to leverage the weakness of IBM's own IP,
its ability to control its critics and competitors and customers
and then impose his own.
And so in another bit of irony, 
Gates, who spends a chunk of his life
fighting one of the biggest antitrust cases in history, 
maybe the biggest,
also is only able to get started 
because the DOJ goes after IBM for monopoly shit, like 
because IBM has stopped from making monopoly.
That's why they don't go in-house 
to make their operating system
because they're worried about antitrust shit, 
which is why Bill Gates gets rich.
Like 
all of these things he hates his whole life
or the whole reason he has money 
like it's.

Yeah. Now, Microsoft.
OK, 
so by 1980, Microsoft was enough of a real company
that Bill was able to hire his buddy Steve Ballmer
to do the non techie business managing stuff 
that was necessary in a growing company.
Ballmer was employee number 24.

So there were twists and turns, obviously, 
in the story of Microsoft's growth.
But the gist of it is it expanded steadily over the 80s 
in 1986 It had its IPO, 
which is the IPO is when it goes public on the stock market.
That's when all of the people who found a company get rich as shit.
And Gates gets 
I mean, he's always been rich, but he gets fuck.
He gets fucking everyone money at this point 
from 1987 on.
He was never off the list of wealthiest Americans.

now Gates and Balmer fought constantly.
They were as much rivals as they were friends.
And again, 
Steve Balmer has 
is allegedly throws chairs at employees during meetings 
when they argue with him.
So like the two would get into screaming arguments 
over just about anything.
One friendly chess match between the two 
ended in Bill Gates throwing a tantrum 
and tossing the board in pieces off the table.
But none of this fighting seems to have harmed the expansion of the company.
In the 1980s, Balmer headed the team that developed Windows.
By the 1990s, Apple and Microsoft were the biggest names in the computing game.
The history of that rivalry is something we could get into.
But honestly, 
both are harmed, 
helmed by narcissistic assholes.
What do you care?
The story of Gates's crappitude has less to do with like shady shit
that he did fighting another giant company
and more to do with 
how he constantly assaulted anyone trying to innovate 
in a way that might reduce Microsoft profits.
Corey Doctorow describes this as a process of tying, quote,
he ties the ability to get Windows or DOS on your machine
to an agreement not to pre-install rival products.
He can sabotage the operating system, 
which he does through vertical integration.
He sells you an operating system 
and a suite of applications that run on it.
And then if you make a competing application, 
he can tweak the operating system.
Excel, for example, had a long running competitor
that was, by all accounts, better 
called Lotus one, two and three.
The model at Microsoft was DOS isn't done 
until Lotus won't run
and every new release would just fall apart.
So they literally sabotage other products
so that they won't work on Microsoft machines.

Bill 
and Microsoft also had the ability 
to strategically snuff out rivals
by bundling free versions of rival products into the operating system.
So in Toronto, 
there was a great software success story called Delrina
that made the world's most successful fact software.
One day they started including free fact software with Windows
and no one ever bought a Delrina license again.
That was the end of it.
But Gates was able to do 
what everyone who's dreamt of a command economy wanted to do, 
subordinate the individual priorities
of other market actors to his needs 
to achieve a strategic goal,
in this case, for his own enrichment.
So that's fucking cool.
Now, all of this went very smoothly for Gates and for Microsoft
until the latter half of the 1990s.
Now, throughout the 90s, 
the Justice Department is kind of on an annual basis
sending out their equivalent of like warning shots, 
saying like,
we're investigating potential antitrust at Microsoft,
but nothing really solid materializes 
until Bill Gates decides to take aim
at a plucky little web browser called Netscape Navigator.
Ah, yes. 
Now, if you're not as old as us, 
especially if you came of age
after the dominance of social media 
browser preference probably doesn't mean a lot to you.
Like people can argue about Firefox or Chrome or Safari or, 
I don't know, fucking opera.
But unless you're using Microsoft Edge, 
like some sort of goddamn heathen,
all browsers are more or less fine 
from a usability standpoint, right?

Yeah. Yeah.
But back in the day, 
Netscape, 
Netscape was the only PC browser
that wasn't an unholy nightmare to use.
Like everything was trash.
And then there was Netscape Navigator, 
this oasis of competent design
in a sea of mostly Microsoft Explorer flavored shit like 
fucking Netscape ruled 
consumers loved it.
And that drove Gates crazy.
In 1995, he had some of his people meet the developers of the browser
and offer to invest in the company.
Microsoft reps were extremely complimentary at this meeting.
The friendly attitude did not last, though, 
from a write up in a blog dedicated to the book, 1995, 
the year the future began, quote,
the pretense of cordiality dissipated on June 21st, 1995,
at a four hour meeting at Netscape headquarters in Mountain View,
California, at which representatives of Microsoft delivered
what Netscape considered a heavy handed threat.
Divide the market for web browsers 
or face the prospect of annihilation.
According to detailed notes of the meeting 
made by Mark Andreessen, Netscape's co-founder, 
Microsoft's representatives proposed
restricting the Netscape Navigator browser 
to older versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems.
That would mean excluding Navigator from Windows 95,
the upgraded operating system 
that Microsoft was planning to release.
Now, at the time, 
no one was 100 percent sure
if Microsoft was legally allowed to do this.
There are laws against being a monopoly.
And when you're saying not only do we make operating systems,
but we unilaterally will decide which browsers work for them.
You're edging across that line.
But again, it was new enough that like 
there was debate

as to whether or not this was 
this was verboten.
Now, Andreessen at the time was a 24 year old callow youth
like Bill had been back in Albuquerque, 
and he described Microsoft reps
as acting like Don Corleone from The Godfather.

I have never been in a meeting with 
in my 35 year business career
in which a competitor had so blatantly implied 
that we would either stop competing with it 
or the competitor would kill us.
In all my years in business, 
I have never heard nor experienced
such an explicit proposal to divide markets.
Netscape said no.
And Microsoft did what they promised.
By 1999, they had successfully killed Netscape,
which was duly bought and destroyed by AOL.
RIP 
pour one out to my own

yeah
Well, it's like 
you guys were never 
never got good at making browsers.
Like 
it clearly wasn't the thing you were interested in.
It was just because someone 
it wasn't even 
it wasn't even because it was going to hurt your ability to make money
because they're using the thing 
on your computers that they're paying for.
It was that someone else was making money 
like it didn't even hurt you.
You just hate the idea that other people will profit.

it's amazing.
So, yeah, 
that meeting with Microsoft and Netscape
where Microsoft threatened Netscape 
wound up playing a key role
in a massive 1998 antitrust lawsuit 
the federal government brought against Microsoft, 
20 state governments joined the lawsuit,
which alleged that 
the company was engaged in a systemic pattern of anti-competitive tactics.
Its attempt to wipe out all competition in the browser market
was just one example of this.
The government case against Microsoft was heavily boosted
by a memorandum written in 1995 by Gates himself titled
the Internet tidal wave.
It described Netscape as a threat that had to be beaten.
The government alleged using this 
that Microsoft set out to win at any cost.
The federal judge who heard the case, Thomas Pinfield Jackson,
decided for the government, finding that Microsoft had 
attempted to monopolize the web browser market.
He ordered the company split in two.
Now, 
you're probably aware that this did not happen.
Microsoft appealed.
They obviously 
they have all of the money in the world.
They appeal. 
The judge's decision gets overturned.
They 
the thing they eventually got was just like a slap on the wrist.
I'm not going to labor long on why this happened.
Microsoft had all the money, all the lawyers.

Our system is designed for them to win.
What's important 
and what was valuable about the antitrust suit
is that it shattered Bill Gates for a while.
It was hugely stressful.
It made for months of bad PR.
It led him to have several in office nervous breakdowns.
And worst of all, 
it involved a public deposition that exposed him
to the world as exactly the kind of arrogant and angry little man.
Those who'd worked closely with him had known 
since the Albuquerque days.
So let's end this episode by talking about that deposition.
Microsoft's legal strategy in the first case 
was to depict the prosecutors
as out of touch old fogies who didn't understand technology
and to claim like Microsoft is just acting in the way
any reasonable tech company would do.
Gates's lawyers and PR flax wanted him to make hay out of his reputation
as a boy genius who dropped out of Harvard 
to become the world's richest man.
Here's how Ars Technica described what came next.
By day two, it became clear that the strategy was failing spectacularly.
As New Yorker writer Kent Owletto once noted, 
Gates had never in his life groveled for a job 
or suffered many of the indignities
most of us experience on a regular basis.
He regularly berated reporters 
for asking what he'd say were stupid questions.
Publicly lauded as the wise sage, 
consummate businessman and industry visionary, 
Gates was accustomed to being treated with obsequious deference 
from all but a small number of peers.
As such, he had little or no experience tolerating,
let alone encountering dissent, criticism or challenges to his authority.
The lack of experience played right into the government's hand.
Instead of portraying a leader in control of his domain 
and confident in his case 
and his company's legal and ethical righteousness,
the courtroom video showed 
a side of Gates that had never been on public display before.
He was petulant, petty, flustered and dour.
He was ineffectual.
He was in a word 
beaten 
during three days of intense questioning.
Gates often feigned ignorance of his own company's policies and actions.
He parsed out everyday words or phrases 
such as concern, support and piss on.
Gates seemed to use the strategy to evade tough questions
about whether his company abused its entrenched Windows franchise
to kill off emerging competitors such as Navigator and Java.
To the surprise of him and his many attorneys and image handlers,
Gates came off as argumentative, petty 
and someone badly losing ground to a more formidable rival.
What example of this exchange came 
came in this exchange with David Boyce,
the private attorney hired by the Justice Department.
Boyce, 
what non-Microsoft browsers were you concerned about in January of 1996? 
Gates.
I don't know what you mean concerned.
Boyce, 
what is it about the word concerned that you don't understand?
Gates, 
I'm not sure what you mean by it.
Boyce 
is 
Gates.
Is there a document where I use that term?
Boyce, 
is the term concerned a term you're familiar with in the English language? Gates. 
Yes.
Boyce, 
Does it have a meaning you're familiar with? 
Gates. 
Yes.
You fucking piece of shit.

Yeah.
Again, it's like that Ars Technica writer points out, like 
he's 
he's
he's never had to grapple for a job.
He's never had to deal with indignities.
At one point, Thomas Penfield Jackson, 
the judge hearing the case, started laughing.
Microsoft lawyers argued during a closed door session
that the deposition was turning into a sideshow 
and government lawyers should be barred 
from showing any more segments during the trial.
The judge denied this motion saying, if anything,
I think your problem is with your witness,
not the way in which his testimony is being presented.
Basically like there, 
you can't show this deposition
because it makes us look bad.
And the judge is like, 

Now 
Unfortunately, for all mankind,
the Microsoft antitrust case was actually kind of 
even though the government kind of lost was
basically the best case scenario for such a trial in our system.
Good didn't win and evil didn't lose.
But evil had a horrible time and wound up traumatized enough
that it quit its job.
So that's like the best case scenario.
You're never going to break up the big company
because they have all the money to fight you.
But you can make the CEO like 
not want to do his job anymore.
