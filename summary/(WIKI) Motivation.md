Motivation is why a behavior start, resume, or stop at certain moment. 

Another point of view is through flexibility that reflected in changing behavior through new experience. Rat through maze is more flexible, and can be said has motivational states, than flies. Although still need to consider limitation, like a paralyzed person that can have motivational states without displaying flexibility. So flexibility is suffice but isn't essential to indicate motivation.

Every Agent have motivational states, with various strength, that drives them through goal oriented behavior. The main state is desires, but there is also beliefs and intentions. Multiple states can conflicting and the strongest will be manifesting into behavior. So behavior doesn't necessarily reflect existing motivations, just the strongest.

Theories from Humean Tradition, denies states other than desire can motivate. With desire strength, form strongest desire thesis. Where various weak desire may defeat the strongest desire. Objection raised with relationship of the Agent themselves that have freewill and the Agent themselves that decide the action. Other is sense of duty that may conflicting with strongest desire or intention that based on commitment. Though intention might be combined with the strongest desire, may materialized with the difference of animal and human.

The categorization of Agent may be another point of discussion. Either continuity of human and animal, or difference of specific reason and commit through intention than just following strongest desire.

Relation between motivation and behavior can be defined as core causal or just one explanation aspect. 

The content of motivational states bring various theories that categorically named [[Motivation - Content Theories]]. Theories that posit humans have needs to drives motivation with various priorities from basic to higher needs. To define using internal force can bring complexities to measure. The content of motivation: things that motivate is the first of motivation reseach. Since these theories focus on goals category, these theories related to Need Theories. This include Abraham Maslow's [[Hierarchy Of Needs]] and Herzberg's [[Two-Factor Theory]]. 

[[Hierarchy Of Needs]] based on human needs. That human is inherently good and have great potential through inner drive. Emphasizing basic need to be met before the next needs and finally on self actualization. Basic Physiological Needs like food and shelter. Safety Needs like protection. Love or Belonging Needs like giving and receiving affection. Esteem Needs like competence and control in personal life. Depriving basic and lower needs could lead to depression or lower self esteem, and with emotional support can lead to decreased emotional challenges. According to Maslow people motivated with unsatisfied needs. And the top of hierarchy is self realization and self actualization needs. This hierarchy continued by Alderfer with ERG theory, from three group core needs, Existance (basic need), Relatedness (social status need), and Growth (self actualization).

[[Two-Factor Theory]] focus more on job satisfaction in workplace. The first of two factors are Motivators that existence will result in job satisfaction. And Hygiene factors that absence will result in job dissatisfaction, like hygiene that if absent will lower health. Motivators may change over time, a few example were: achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth. Some Hygiene factors were: company policy, supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, status, job security, and personal life.

Another category is [[Motivation - Behaviorist Theories]], that try to explain based on relation between situation and observable behavior without referencing mental states. A theories that empirical theorist prefer. But an Agent may behave differently even in similar situation. An indicator that internal states, mainly mental states, still has an effect. 

Main paradigm of mental states is desire. Although there’s other states too, like beliefs in relation to obligation or intention. Mental disease can occur when there is no motivation. 

From desire point of view, motivation can be intrinsic if the behavior itself is inherently desirable, or extrinsic if the goal is outside the behavior itself. Some argue intrinsic is better than extrinsic.

States that bring motivation, or “essentially motivation-constituting attitudes”, and states that circumstance or other states contingent is distinct. [[The Action Desire]] always provide motivation, even if ended up against performing action because of circumstances. Instrumental belief of ways achieving goals, might provide motivational contingent. An Agent may have many goals, but contingent on the Agent's ability or capability. Absence of desire doesn't indicate absence of motivation. Rational deliberation might produce motivation.

Another category is awareness, Occurent and Standing Desires, whether the Agent is aware of the motivation that drives them, between conscious (Occurent) and unconscious (Standing) motivation. 

[[Motivation Socio-Cultural Theories]] sees motivation as result of being inside cultural context of social groups.

The central ideas is that Agent will behave according to what that Agent rationally believe need to be taken. Akrasia, or [[Weakness of Will]], is if the Agent taking irrationally different behavior.

A few field of motivation research is on business with [[ The Work Motivation]] and on education with [[The Learning Motivation]]. Including difference intrinsic and extrinsic effect.
