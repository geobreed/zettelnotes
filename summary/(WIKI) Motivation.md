Motivation is why a behavior start, resume, or stop at certain moment. 

Another point of view is through flexibility that reflected in changing behavior through new experience. Rat through maze is more flexible, and can be said has motivational states, than flies. Although still need to consider limitation, like a paralyzed person that can have motivational states without displaying flexibility. So flexibility is suffice but isn't essential to indicate motivation.

Every Agent have motivational states, with various strength, that drives them through goal oriented behavior. The main state is desires, but there is also beliefs and intentions. Multiple states can conflicting and the strongest will be manifesting into behavior. So behavior doesn't necessarily reflect existing motivations, just the strongest.

Theories from Humean Tradition, denies states other than desire can motivate. With desire strength, form strongest desire thesis. Where various weak desire may defeat the strongest desire. Objection raised with relationship of the Agent themselves that have freewill and the Agent themselves that decide the action. Other is sense of duty that may conflicting with strongest desire or intention that based on commitment. Though intention might be combined with the strongest desire, may materialized with the difference of animal and human.

The categorization of Agent may be another point of discussion. Either continuity of human and animal, or difference of specific reason and commit through intention than just following strongest desire.

Relation between motivation and behavior can be defined as core causal or just one explanation aspect. 

The content of motivational states bring various theories that categorically named [[Motivation - Content Theories]]. Theories that posit humans have needs to drives motivation with various priorities from basic to higher needs. To define using internal force can bring complexities to measure. The content of motivation: things that motivate is the first of motivation reseach. Since these theories focus on goals category, these theories related to Need Theories. This include Abraham Maslow's [[Hierarchy Of Needs]] and Herzberg's [[Two-Factor Theory]]. 

[[Hierarchy Of Needs]] based on human needs. That human is inherently good and have great potential through inner drive. Emphasizing basic need to be met before the next needs and finally on self actualization. Basic Physiological Needs like food and shelter. Safety Needs like protection. Love or Belonging Needs like giving and receiving affection. Esteem Needs like competence and control in personal life. Depriving basic and lower needs could lead to depression or lower self esteem, and with emotional support can lead to decreased emotional challenges. According to Maslow people motivated with unsatisfied needs. And the top of hierarchy is self realization and self actualization needs. This hierarchy continued by [[Alderfer‘s ERG Theory]], from three group core needs, Existance (basic need), Relatedness (social status need), and Growth (self actualization).

[[Two-Factor Theory]] focus more on job satisfaction in workplace. The first of two factors are Motivators that existence will result in job satisfaction. And Hygiene factors that absence will result in job dissatisfaction, like hygiene that if absent will lower health. Motivators may change over time, a few example were: achievement, recognition, work itself, responsibility, advancement, and growth. Some Hygiene factors were: company policy, supervision, working conditions, interpersonal relations, salary, status, job security, and personal life.

[[Self-Determination Theory]] approached motivation through traditional empirical with relation to the Agent essential inner personality development. The three basic need is relatedness, competence, and autonomy. Where certain social environment really plays an important part in the type of motivation that results. There’s two type of motivations that this theory categorizes, with both can manifest in intrinsic and extrinsic action. The first is amotivation, where Agent feels the environment is controlled through monitoring and instructions. The behavior that the Agent make are just to get external rewards or to avoid punishment. The second is autonomous motivation, where motivation result from their own lifestyle and how they engage with their work because innate desire. Behavior that can result from supportive social environments. 

Classical and Operant Conditioning sees behavior as a response triggered by certain environment or physical stimuli. A Classical Conditioning is like a dentist (conditioned stimuli) paired with the pain (unconditioned stimuli) so the patient responds with reluctant because of fear (conditioned response). Operant Conditioning focuses the consequences with encouraging or discouraging certain behavior. Desirable behavior are given a reward as reinforcement, and undesirable behavior are given punishment. Timing of the consequences also important, the longer time pass between behavior and consequences, the effectiveness will be lower. Another factor is environment that can affect the effect of the consequences. Some consequences the usually discourages behavior, may cause different responses on certain environments. There is also a mechanism to study motivation through consequences that have been applied and the resulting responses. 

Motivating Operations (MO) fills the gap of Operant Conditioning that focuses on altering future behavior. Motivating Operations have two effect. The first is Value-Altering Effect, that modify efficiency of a reinforcer. The second is Behavior-Altering Effect, that modify learned behavior. From the type modification that results, MO has two type. The first is Establishing Operation if increasing effect. The second is Abolishing Operation if decreasing effect. 

William McDougall’s Purposive Psychology or Hormic Psychology emphasizes purpose or intent. That behavior is a reflex from intrinsic motivation. 

[[Incentive Motivation Theory]] focuses on the principle of reinforcement. The most common incentive is compensation, that can be tangible or intangible. Still affected be timing, and also by repetitive action-reward will build a habit. A reinforcer is response post action so that the action occur more. With this, differentiating intrinsic and extrinsic is not necessary. This theory influenced by beliefs. Psychologist like B.F. Skinner especially in his Radical Behaviorism that posit every action has social ramifications. So positive or negative response from other will affect behavior. Another unique point of incentive theory from drive theory is that incentive theory focuses on “attracting” the desired action. Reinforcing that result in a happier Agent. Drive theory still involving negative stimuli. Like drinking to eliminate thirstiness. 

Another category is [[Motivation - Behaviorist Theories]], that try to explain based on relation between situation and observable behavior without referencing mental states. A theories that empirical theorist prefer. But an Agent may behave differently even in similar situation. An indicator that internal states, mainly mental states, still has an effect. 

Main paradigm of mental states is desire. Although there’s other states too, like beliefs in relation to obligation or intention. Mental disease can occur when there is no motivation. 

A drive or desire can activate a behavior with some goal or incentive. Inherently internal, so may not need external stimuli. There is a few basic drives like hunger, or a more subtle one like achievements. Another basic one is sexual drive. 

From desire point of view, motivation can be intrinsic if the behavior itself is inherently desirable, or extrinsic if the goal is outside the behavior itself. Some argue intrinsic is better than extrinsic.

[[The Intrinsic Motivation]] exists inside the Agent, and an internal rewards, rather than external stimuli. Where the action or behavior itself have positive effect to the Agent. The activity itself providing the motivation and not dependent on external rewards. Many have argued intrinsic motivation promotes subject well being in cognitive, social, and physical development. Intrinsic Motivation also shown in animals like curiosity. Agent that intrinsically motivated (compared to extrinsic motivation) have shown more interest, excitement, and confidence that in turn manifest as enhanced performance, persistence, and creativity. Some theorist posit two core element of intrinsic motivation, self-determination or autonomy and competence. One view is that the Agent internally saw the action or task will increase Agent’s competence. 

States that bring motivation, or “essentially motivation-constituting attitudes”, and states that circumstance or other states contingent is distinct. [[The Action Desire]] always provide motivation, even if ended up against performing action because of circumstances. Instrumental belief of ways achieving goals, might provide motivational contingent. An Agent may have many goals, but contingent on the Agent's ability or capability. Absence of desire doesn't indicate absence of motivation. Rational deliberation might produce motivation.

Another category is awareness, Occurent and Standing Desires, whether the Agent is aware of the motivation that drives them, between conscious (Occurent) and unconscious (Standing) motivation. 

[[Motivation Socio-Cultural Theories]] sees motivation as result of being inside cultural context of social groups.

The central ideas is that Agent will behave according to what that Agent rationally believe need to be taken. Akrasia, or [[Weakness of Will]], is if the Agent taking irrationally different behavior.

A few field of motivation research is on business with [[ The Work Motivation]] and on education with [[The Learning Motivation]]. Including difference intrinsic and extrinsic effect.
