One political strategy to employ if the current situation is seen as less than ideal and you bear some if not all responsibility.

First is to admit the fact of current situation, convincing someone is always from [[Common Ground Beginning]]. To not admitting about what is currently being perceived is to close voters from understanding and in the end supporting. To see a campaign that ignore them is a permission to ignore their message too.

Second is learn from the current situation, making sure to make the lesson is easy to digest. The skill to explain in simple and powerful language is paramount to this step. The voter should be easily adopt the position and provide their support. This is important step and a crucial one not only for gathering support but also for the future. A political stance is a seed for motivation. Even if the campaign lost the race, the seed can move to unintended course. Taking the right lesson is imperative to ideal outcome. Like a campaign based on [[Laffer Curve Theory]] might be easier to understand but reality is not as simple as campaign slogan and can have [[Unintended Consequences Outcomes]].

Third is contrasting the opponent position with the lesson learned. This step is for securing support in political landscape. For others this step maybe not to essential.

This strategy is harder than the opposition that only need to emphasize the result of current party's policy and to support a change.
