Asking the person about their prediction for their own change is a good predictor. This effect often called "self-efficacy". The effect of believing to have received an effective treatment is a strong influence that the standard testing of a medication is not no medication but a placebo.

Interestingly this effect is not limited to inside the person but also from the helping professional. In one study, randomly chosen alcohol treatment patient that identified to staff as having high potential for recovery is significantly more likely to be sober.

Perceived prognosis influences real outcomes.
