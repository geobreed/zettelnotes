Economics does not talk about the moral of our nature. It talks about incentives. In the end if there is incentives to themselves, it's easy to convince that it has moral value. Easy to justify according to self interest.

Its not always negative though. As self interest is subject to [[Perceived Value Standard]] of that individual. Even self sacrifice can be an incentive if align with that person self interest.
