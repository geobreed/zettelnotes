A situation when one party can gain without assuming the corresponding full risk that come with that gain and therefore incentivize to keep taking more risks.

It's like [[Living Beyond Means]] but the risks is borne by everybody else. In a sense, if that lifestyle come from debt and the resulting credit failure does only part or none of the consequence to the responsible party.
