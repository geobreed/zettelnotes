The way of thinking that technical mastery of that business will translate into business mastery. An assumption that a business only need technical mastery. A perspective that can doom entrepreneurship.

The basis of [[The Entrepreneurial Myth]]. A form of [[Underestimating The Unknown]] and [[Overestimating Self Skill]].

This assumption is fatal because a business need a different skill to be successful.
