When the [[Price Value Discrepancy]] too high and the increase in price is based solely on  enthusiasm of a mass population of investors and not real value, there will be a bubble period.

Example of these period is the tulip mania in 17th century Holland, dot-com bubble in mid-to-late 1990s, US housing bubble in 2000s. And in 2017 Robert J. Shiller also called Bitcoin as the best current example of a speculative bubble.

Judging a period is in economic bubble is usually more from hindsight perspective because of mass adoption required of the bases mindset in the economic population and from the eventual pop of the bubble when the price is met with the real value of the assets.
