One of my [[Basic Belief System]], that self existence is valuable. My chosen core identity is to always give concrete contribution. One of the form of [[Leave Everything Better]] in workgroup environment.

Doesn't need to be a big contribution, a good small talk to ease moment or a smile to indicate a warm welcome for example.
