All well known business is Mature Business. They know their own direction. Not end result, but early perspective. The important thing is not product, like the basis for [[Entrepreneurial Fatal Assumption]], but the business itself.
- Entrepreneurial Perspective
	- How must the business work?
	- System for producing result
	- Begin with future image and bridging from present
- Technician Perspective
	- What work to be done?
	- Place work take place
	- Begin with present and no idea about future

A Mature Business does not come from [[Infancy - Technician Phase]] or [[Adolescence - Getting Help]] phase. A Mature Business begin with small Mature Business.
