One of common frustration in professionals who deals with motivation. About why people donâ€™t change. 
"You would think that because of X he/she would do Y."
About the mounting evidence of the negative still does not make a change in one behavior. 
Can be considered as an example of [[Clouded Judgment Behavior]].
