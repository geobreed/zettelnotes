If a [[Brief Intervention Effects]] happen with a little counseling, more counseling dose ought to help more.

This line of thinking had a mixed evidence, although in general more counseling more benefit in behavior change. But this might related to some third factor - like [[Motivation For Change]]. In randomly assigned more versus less or to inpatient versus outpatient for alcohol use disorders, on average brief intervention yield outcomes that is similar to longer treatment. For inpatient-outpatient, the change occurs in the first one or two weeks, again suggesting for brief intervention.

These findings suggest for a new way of thinking about critical condition for change to occur.
