Knowledge that we don't aware of our lack of knowledge. A complete lack of perspective and information of these knowledges.

A good application of [[The Student Principle]] is to always be aware of an [[Unrecognized Unknown Knowledge]] that we might miss. That maybe our initial perception is wrong because of an incomplete knowledge.

Because we don't aware of these knowledge, recognition usually came from connection to [[Recognized Unknown Knowledge]] that we study.
