The fifth step of [[Business Development Program]], about the strategy to compel people.

To separate business from self means to compel people to run that business, each of the mundanity.

How to compel people to do checklist, we can't. Only way is making an environment that 'doing it' is more important to people than not doing it. Where it became a way of life for them.
Take them seriously, take business seriously, so they take business seriously.
Introduce to the idea of what the business do, [[Your Primary Aim]] the philosophy, how the work is reflection of who we are.

Give people opportunity to make choice before they done the work. Make sure they understand the idea that more important behind the work they asked to do.
Example:
- the customer is not always right, but either way, our job is to make them feel right
- everyone who works here is expected to work the best possible, if not should act that way until does, if unwilling, should leave
- business is where knowledge tested by unknown, the conflict which creating growth, meaning

People want to work in a clear defined structure for acting, from which they can test themselves. A structure called a game. Exciting is a well conceived game.
Best business represent people that create them. A game to be played with rule that symbolize owner ideas of the world.
Their commitment based on owner introduction to the game before it begun.
And this strategy is the way to communicate this idea
Start from [[Your Primary Aim]] and [[Your Strategic Objective]] continue to [[Your Organizational Strategy]] with chart and position contract and operating manual.
The game is a measure of you. 
![[Business 'Game Rules']] 
The idea need to be communicated to people, both word and deed, a well planned process.
Not only document but manner. Hiring process comprised of distinct components
Systemyzing business need not a dehumanizing experience.
Without idea worth pursuing, there is no People Strategy at all.
