The fifth step of [[Business Development Program]], about the strategy to compel people.

To separate business from self means to compel people to run that business, each of the mundanity. And to compel them is to create [[Importance Reflection Environment]], ensure willingness with [[Prework Choice Opportunity]], and channel that motivation through a [[Clear Defined Structure]] of a business that clearly [[Symbolize Owner Ideas]].

The idea need to be communicated to people, both word and deed, a well planned process.
Not only document but manner. Hiring process comprised of distinct components
Systemizing business need not a dehumanizing experience.
Without idea worth pursuing, there is no People Strategy at all.
