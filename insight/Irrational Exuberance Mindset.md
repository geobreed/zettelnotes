The phrase Irrational Exuberance came from Alan Greenspan speeches about the dot-com bubble in Desember 5, 1996 when he's Federal Reserve Chairman. The phrase meant to obscure true opinion in long complex words and mute any strong market response. But market still showing strong market response.

Yale professor Robert J. Shiller, Greenspan's source for the phrase, also states that this mindset is the psychological basis of speculative bubble. Where the price increase based solely on investor enthusiasm and spreads by psychological contagion. In the contagion, many stories emerges to justify price movement not numerical facts of the assets. 

When this mindset takes critical mass, there going to be [[Economic Bubble Period]]. Although realization of the mindset usually in hindsight.
