The delay between transaction concluded and the delivery of that transaction.

For example like the delay between concluding the selling process and handing the product or the delay of picking groceries and paying in cashier. In former example there is like a pseudo-robbery and in later example there is like pseudo-stealing.

A stock market is when this delay eventually being accepted to be the norm because of the process of delivering those stock papers to recipient does indeed hard. Especially in [[Normal Short Selling]] where there is 4 deliveries, borrow, sell, buy, and returning.

This delay also one of the factor that make it easy to do [[Naked Short Selling]].
