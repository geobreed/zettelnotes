Apology isn't just saying sorry. There is 3 component to a sincere apology:
- [[Admit Responsibility Owned]]
- [[Aware Injustices Resulted]]
- [[Change Reparation Commitment]]

Some philosophers believe remorse or regret need to be exist, regret for beyond control remorse for in control. Some apology, like from contact center agent of a company, still considered functional even though it's impossible for sincerity from the agent.

I myself think that the apologies in Muslim Eid is not a sincere apology. The event is to be aware that we human have committed many wrongs including the unconscious and unrecognized wrongs and to apologize. But because there is no awareness of the wrongs there can never be a commitment to do differently next time or a reparation for the injustices caused. Even though it's not a sincere, to be aware of unknown wrongs is transforming [[Unrecognized Unknown Knowledge]] into [[Recognized Unknown Knowledge]] and still a useful tools for introspection.
