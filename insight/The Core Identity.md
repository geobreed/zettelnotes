Every sentient being has a sense of self that is formed from various [[Basic Belief System]] that is accumulated from their experience in life.

Every individual has their own core identity, consisted with their own set of belief system. Those belief system set is that individual's core identity.

One of my core identity basic belief system is The Art of Charm motto, [[Leave Everything Better]].
