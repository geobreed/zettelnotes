A principle of a student to living life with a perspective to learn. A constant curiosity as a form of [[Adding Self Value]].

That everyone and everything have something of a value for me to absorb. Currently, base perspective is others are higher than self.

Interestingly, with genuine curiosity and willingness to learn, even though all we do are explicitly gaining value for ourselves, the other parties can still gain value. With genuine curiosity as a form of appreciation and acknowledgement to the other parties expertness. A calibrated genuine curiousness does [[Adding Others Value]] indeed.

A bit hard if the face value given from other parties is close to blatantly opposing self point as view.
