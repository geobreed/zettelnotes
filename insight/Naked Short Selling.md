A practice in Stock Market that occurred because of an acceptance of [[Transaction Delivery Delay]] from the burden to make a stack of stock papers delivered. Even through to the modern world when internet speed exists.

It's like a [[Normal Short Selling]] but skipping the borrowing part:
1. not borrowing stock, 
2. sell nonexistent stock, 
3. wait after downward movement, 
4. buying at lower price, 
5. deliver the stock to recipient in step 2
