Motivation is why a behavior start, resume, or stop. 

Every Agent have motivational states that drives them through goal oriented behavior. The main state is desires, but there is also beliefs and intentions. Multiple states can conflicting and the strongest will be manifesting into behavior. So behavior doesn't necessarily reflect existing motivations, just the strongest.

The content of motivational states bring various theories that categorically named [[Motivation - Content Theories]]. Theories that posit humans have needs to drives motivation with various priorities from basic to higher needs.

Another category is [[Motivation - Behaviorist Theories]], that try to explain based on relation between situation and observable behavior without referencing mental states.

From desire point of view, motivation can be intrinsic if the behavior itself is inherently desirable, or extrinsic if the goal is outside the behavior itself. Some argue intrinsic is better than extrinsic. 

Another category is awareness, whether the Agent is aware of the motivation that drives them, between conscious and unconscious motivation.

The central ideas is that Agent will behave according to what that Agent rationally believe need to be taken. Akrasia, or Weakness of the Will, is if the Agent taking irrationally different behavior.
