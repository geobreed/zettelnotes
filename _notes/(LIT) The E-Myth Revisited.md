### Chapter 14. Your Organizational Strategy
[[Business Organizational Strategy]] is for structuring. If not structured its a mob, mob don't make things, mob destroy things.
Most companies [[Organizing Around Personalities]] rather than functions, around people than responsibilities, that always result in chaos.
Example Steps:
- create role outside business - shareholder
- create initial role inside business - employees
- create [[Business Strategic Objective]]
	- research [[Central Demographic Model]] chosen
		- how many potential buyer in territory?
		- population growth?
		- competition?
		- market prices?
		- future market?
		- anticipated growth?
		- zoning change?
	- create questionnaire to sample [[Central Demographic Model]] consumer for other companies
	- conduct Needs Analysis to understand consumer meaning of product how think and feel, improvement wanted, ideal product
	- collect preliminary financial data for loan from the bank, operating pro forma, cash flow projection for first year operation
	- look for encouraging data of [[Central Demographic Model]], competition, pricing
- organizational development, creating [[The Organization Chart]]
	- for example one location assembly sell to specific consumer in territory
	- Shareholder, get report from
		- President and Chief Operating Officer (COO), accountable for overall achievement of [[Business Strategic Objective]], that get report from
			- Vice-President/Marketing, accountable for finding customer and finding new ways to provide customers with satisfaction they derive from product, at lower cost, with greater ease, get report from
				- Sales Manager

	- Have to describe all the work at full potential, and work to be done right away.
- Next is writing [[The Position Contract]]
	- this is not job description, but a contract between company and employee
	- summary of the rules of the company's game
	- provide commitment and accountability
	- Who responsible for what position, and being counted on to produce what
- Next naming the people to be put in what position. And signing [[The Position Contract]].
	- because the most important is to follow the rules of the game you create with integrity
- After finalizing [[The Organization Chart]] begin the [[Prototyping The Position]]
	- begin from bottom, salesperson and production person and account receivable clerk not COO or VP/marketing
	- doing tactical work not strategic work and then searching other people to do tactical work to free and switch to strategic work.
	- each with [[Business Development Program]] innovation quantification orchestration
	- developing manuals for each positions
### Chapter 15. Your Management Strategy
Your [[Business Management Strategy]] not of competent manager but [[The Management System]]
- a system designed into your prototype to produce a marketing result
- more automatic, more effective your [[The Franchise Prototype]]
Management Development, process to create management system and teach managers to use it, is a Marketing Tool
- not to create efficient Prototype but effective, that profitably finds and keeps customer better than other
- A few examples, match, mint, cup of coffee, newspaper
	- Operation Manual, a series of checklist
	- Checklist of what specific step to do, is signed, if not according to standard, instant dismissal
	- A drawing to identifies each step and the order to be done, for training new employee
	- Supervisor run spot check to make certain any error caught in time.
	- equal system for lighting, sauna, pool, outdoor light change intensity when darker
### Chapter 16. Your People Strategy
How to compel people to do checklist, we can't. Only way is making an environment that 'doing it' is more important to people than not doing it. Where it became a way of life for them.
Take them seriously, take business seriously, so they take business seriously.
Introduce to the idea of what the business do, [[Business Primary Aim]] the philosophy, how the work is reflection of who we are.
Give people opportunity to make choice before they done the work. Make sure they understand the idea that more important behind the work they asked to do.
Example:
- the customer is not always right, but either way, our job is to make them feel right
- everyone who works here is expected to work the best possible, if not should act that way until does, if unwilling, should leave
- business is where knowledge tested by unknown, the conflict which creating growth, meaning
People want to work in a clear defined structure for acting, from which they can test themselves. A structure called a game. Exciting is a well concieved game.
Best business represent people that create them. A game to be played with rule that symbolize owner ideas of the world.
Their commitment based on owner introduction to the game before it begun.
[[Business People Strategy]] is the way to communicate this idea
Start from [[Business Primary Aim]] and [[Business Strategic Objective]] continue to [[Business Organizational Strategy]] with chart and position contract and operating manual.
The game is a measure of you. 
A few [[The Game Rules]] for a taste
- Never figure out what you want to be done and then creating a game of it. The game must come first, people second.
- Never create a game you won't play. People will find out and never forget.
- Make sure there are specific ways to win without ending the game. The end will take the life of the game and business. Unless there is victories in the process, here and there, people will weary. Make game appealing even if not.
- Change the game tactic, not strategies, from time to time. Strategies is ethic, moral of the game logic. The foundation of people commitment. Know when change is called for, might be resistance but persist and it will move them.
- Never expect game to be self sustaining, remind people constantly. Once a week meeting about the game exception make sure everyone know. In itself the game doesn't exist, except when people make it so. Remind them of the game with you. Can't remind them too often.
- The game has to make sense. Everyone shoul be able to see the logic is sufficiently attractive. Know the ground to stand and assemble armament. Game that isn't tested isn't a game at all. Best logic still need strong emotional commitment support. If commitment wanes, logic forgotten. Make sure everyone remember the game reason to exist.
- The game need to be fun from time to time. The thrill is how to deal with "no fun" part. But fun need to be planned into game. Maybe once every six months, something to look forward, and something to forget.
- If you can't think of a good game, steal one. But stolen game need to be learned by heart. Don't pretend to play a game.
The idea need to be communicated to people, both word and deed, a well planned process.
Not only document but manner. Hiring process comprised of distinct components
Systemazing business need not a dehumanizing experience.
Without idea worth pursuing, there is no People Strategy at all.
### Chapter 17. Your Marketing Strategy
[[Business Marketing Strategy]] start and end with customer. Forget about everything but customer. What customer want, not what you think customer want.
Unconscious Mind is where all the action is, it say yes to any compatible with its expectation, and no to any incompatible.
[[Irrational Buying Decision]] is what it is.
Two Pillars of successfull marketing strategy is [[Central Demographic Model]] and [[Central Psychographic Model]]. Who and the Why.
After that Prototype can be construct to satisfy unconscious need scientifically.
Each demographic model has specific perceptions that identifiable in advance.
Ask each customer for who they are and their preference.
All of business is Marketing Process, start with promise to attract them to buy, continues with the sales, and end with the delivery of the promise. Make a promise customer want to hear, and deliver those better than anyone else.
### Chapter 18. Your Systems Strategy
A system is set of things, actions, ideas, and information that interact with each other and alter other system. 
Innovation, Quantification, Orchestration, and Integration of 3 System in business is what [[Business Development Program]] is
Those 3 kinds of system in business is:
- [[Business Hard System]]
	- inanimate, unliving things
	- Prevent a Smudge System for white wall and white board
	- two necessary component of conflict, a third componen to translate conflict to remedial action: will
	- Lucite collar around each board.
	- A hard system producing a human and totally integrated result. System solution to people intensive problem
- [[Business Soft System]]
	- animate, living, or ideas
	- A selling system is a Soft System, a fully orchestrated interaction between you and customer that follow 6 steps
		- Identification of specific Benchmarks, consumer decision points, in selling process
		- Literal scripting of word to get each Benchmark successfully, written down script
		- Creation of various materials for each script
		- Memorization of each Benchmark script
		- Delivery of each script by salespeople in identical standard
		- Leaving your people to communicate more effectively, by articulating, watching, listening, hearing, acknowledging, understanding, engaging every prospect as fully as need be
	- Power Point Selling Process
		- The Appointment Presentation
			- no qualify customer and ascertain if a viable prospect or not
			- purpose is to make an appointment
			- Series of words that engage the prospect's unconscious about the product not commodity
			- efficiently engage unconscious mind to get emotional commitment for appointments that deliver Needs Analysis Presentation
		- Needs Analysis Presentation
			- repeat of Appointment Presentation reestablish emotional commitment
			- tell how to proceed to fulfill promise, how business has develop effective ways to bring product
			- establish credibility in prospect mind, first company expertise, second personal willingness to do what necessary to utilize expertise
			- understand what frustate customer and has expertise to alleviate not personally but systematically and why it works, how it impact the prospect
			- complete Money Management Questionnaire
			- provide information promised and relevancy of Report outset meeting
			- make appointment to return with Report and giving value with no cost, and help the prospect understand the Report.
			- end with appointment for third Benchmark The Solutions Presentation
		- The Solutions Presentation
			- the easiest, because if previous step done effectively, the sale is already made.
			- selling is not "closing", selling is "opening"
			- Opens prospect with deeper experience of his frustation and to opportunities available by going through questioning.
			- simply provides rational armament for the emotional commitment
	- completely predictable technology for producing formerly unpredictable result
- [[Business Information System]]
	- those that provide us with information about interaction between other two.
	- Inventory control, cash flow forecasting, sales activity summary report
	- The Information System will track activity of Selling System from Benchmark to Benchmark
	- It could tell rate of conversion, which is using the system, which aren't, calculated cost,
	- It could tell Things you don't know now
	- Things to know to develop, control, and change your Selling System, in Finance and Production and Product Development.
	- [[Business Systems Strategy]] is the glue of [[The Franchise Prototype]], [[Business Information System]] is the glue of [[Business Systems Strategy]]
	- it tells you when and why you need to change
