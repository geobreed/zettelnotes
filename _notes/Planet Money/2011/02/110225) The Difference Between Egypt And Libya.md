When Egyptians rose up against their government, the Egyptian military protected them. When Libyans rose up against their government, the military started shooting.

On today's Planet Money, we try to figure out why the responses were so different.

In Egypt, the military runs lots of different businesses — from bottled water to household appliances. The Egyptian people are the military's customers.

So the military was following a a basic rule of business: Don't kill your customers. (For more on this, listen to our podcast, "Egypt's Military, Inc.")

In Libya, on the other hand, the entire economy is based on oil and gas exports. And the government controls the money those exports bring in. So neither the government nor the military has to answer to the people.

This is a classic problem in resource-rich developing countries. It's called the resource curse.

On the show, Mansour El-Kikhia describes one small but telling sign of what things are like in Libya: Government workers there often bring two coats to work. They hang one on the door of their office, then leave for the day, wearing the other coat.

    You as a citizen come to get something done in the governmental department.

    You say, "Is this person here?"

    They say, "Yes he's here. His coat is right there. He's somewhere in the building."

    So you wait for five hours, [he] never shows up.

JEFF IMMELT: We want to stay laser-focused on job creation in America. That's the challenge that the president gave us. We know that the private sector has to lead the way on job creation.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

ADAM DAVIDSON, HOST:

And I'm Adam Davidson. Today is Friday, February 25. That was G.E. CEO Jeffrey Immelt, who's now also chairman of the White House Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, that you heard at the top.

BLUMBERG: Today on the podcast - why everyone in Libya wears two coats to work and what that has to say about the prospects for Libyan democracy. That's coming up in a minute.

DAVIDSON: But first, Jacob Goldstein, can you give us our PLANET MONEY Indicator?

JACOB GOLDSTEIN, BYLINE: Adam, Alex, today's PLANET MONEY Indicator is $100 - nice, round indicator. The price of oil in the U.S. - it rose above $100 a barrel yesterday. It's fallen a little bit today, but it's still up in the high $90s, which is about $10 a barrel above where it was a month ago.

BLUMBERG: And this of course is related, somewhat, to what's happening in Libya. Now, we're going to spend the rest of the podcast talking about the situation in Libya. There's massive protests there. There's been a brutal response from Muammar Gaddafi. And we're going to be talking about all of that on the upcoming podcast. But for the purposes of what you're talking about, Jacob, that's affecting the price of gas here, too, as well, right?

GOLDSTEIN: Right. And a pretty straightforward rule of thumb that applies now is, when the price of oil goes up by $10 a barrel, the price of gas goes up by about 25 cents. So people have to spend more money on gas and less money on everything else. That means we have slower economic growth. If oil prices stay up around where they are now, instead of economic growth of, say, 3% this year, we'd have economic growth of maybe 2.7%. Now, this isn't catastrophic. It's not enough on its own to send us back into a recession. But it is definitely bad. You know, it's the opposite of what we need right now. And if the price of oil goes even higher, we can expect to take an even bigger economic hit.

BLUMBERG: Thank you, Jacob.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. Thanks very much.

GOLDSTEIN: Thanks, guys.

BLUMBERG: OK. So as we tape this, we're still not getting a lot of news out of Libya. But much of what we hear is troubling. There's still protesters. From what we understand, the leader, Muammar Gaddafi, is still responding brutally.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Tonight, witnesses in Libya report a massacre. Hundreds dead as the military opens fire on anti-government demonstrators attending a funeral for protesters killed the day before. A doctor described the scene to the BBC.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: What do you see?

UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Oh, my God.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNS FIRING)

UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Oh, my God. They are firing at the civilians here. They are crazy. They are going crazy here.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUNS FIRING)

UNIDENTIFIED DOCTOR: Oh, my God.

DAVIDSON: Now, aside from being horrific, this crackdown in Libya raises a question. We've seen these protests in Algeria, in Egypt. We now see them in Yemen and Bahrain. And nowhere has the response been as violent as the one in Libya. So why is that? Why is Libya responding so differently? Why is Muammar Gaddafi responding so much more violently than any of these other leaders?

BLUMBERG: And that is the question on today's podcast. Why is Libya behaving so differently? Why is it having so much more of a brutal crackdown than the other countries in the region? And we're going to talk to a couple of people about this. First, Geoff Porter - he is a political risk consultant who spent a lot of time in Libya and wrote his Ph.D. thesis there.

DAVIDSON: In fact, we learned how well he knows Libya. Before we started the interview, I was making a silly joke about who I would bribe in Libya to set myself up with a big cellphone franchise. And he actually did have an answer for me.

GEOFF PORTER: No, no. There's a serious answer.

DAVIDSON: Yeah?

PORTER: The person to call would have been Gaddafi's first son from his first marriage, Muhammad Gaddafi, who cornered the telecoms market. And he was the chairman of the PTT (ph), or the Posts Telecommunications...

DAVIDSON: Oh, really?

PORTER: ...And Telegraph (ph). And that was his role. And so if you did want a lock on, you know, mobile phones, you would have contacted Muhammad.

DAVIDSON: Wow.

PORTER: I'm not sure where Muhammad is now.

DAVIDSON: So Geoff told us that one of the reasons Libya's response has been so different from Egypt and other countries is economic. So you and Caitlin did this great podcast a couple weeks ago about how the Egyptian military is not just in the military business. They're in lots and lots of other businesses. They make a lot of money with factories they own that make bread or washing machines.

BLUMBERG: Bottling plants.

DAVIDSON: Bottling plants. They run some tourist resorts. So when they look at people protesting in the street, they're not just seeing protesters. They're seeing customers. And generally, businesses don't like to shoot their customers.

BLUMBERG: No, they don't. In Libya, things are not that way. In Libya, they make money one way.

PORTER: Eighty one percent of Libyan industrial activity is attributable to the oil sector or the hydrocarbon sector - oil and gas. Another 17% is the services sector. Now, when you refer to the services sector, most of that 17% is oil and gas services - so the pipeline construction or the port construction or petro-chem facilities, et cetera. So you have a - again, a very sort of monolithic...

BLUMBERG: 98% is related to oil and gas.

PORTER: Exactly. Right. Exactly.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

PORTER: You know, the country can't survive without hydrocarbon revenue. Libya imports 75% of its foodstuffs. Without oil revenue, it's a nonexistent country.

BLUMBERG: Economists called Libya a rentier state. And that's using an old sort of technical use of the word rent. And the easiest way to describe what they mean by this is to compare Libya to the United States. So in the U.S., people do all sorts of things to make money. The government then taxes them. And so in an economic sense, you can sort of think of the government working for the people. The people make the money, pay the taxes, and then consume government services in exchange for those taxes. You can sort of think of the fire department or the school system or whatever.

In a rentier state like Libya, the money doesn't come from the people creating goods and services that other people want. It comes straight out of the ground. It comes from the oil and gas that's buried in the desert. The state then sells the oil, makes a lot of money and keeps most of it. That's why they call it a rentier state. It's sort of like they're collecting rent.

DAVIDSON: If you look at Gaddafi, he's the landlord. He's collecting that rent. Every week, Libya earns around $1 billion from selling oil to countries around the world. Gaddafi has control of that money. He can use some of it to buy guns and mercenaries to protect the oil fields and to keep the people suppressed. And then there's a lot leftover, which he can spend pretty much however he wants. This is why economists talk about a resource curse. In countries with huge amounts of natural resources, you often see this - corrupt, despotic rulers. Think about Myanmar or Nigeria at various points in its history or Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Resource-rich leaders don't need the people out there earning money, paying taxes. They just need the people to be quiet, and the leaders just want to control the natural resources.

BLUMBERG: Compare that to countries like Egypt or Yemen or Syria. They have had corrupt and despotic leaders, but those leaders get whatever wealth and power they have by siphoning off the money that's earned by their citizens. So those leaders need their citizens to earn money, which gives the citizens at least a bit of power in the whole dynamic.

DAVIDSON: In Libya, Gaddafi really doesn't have to care at all what the people think or feel or do. He can do anything that comes to his mind. And he has.

PORTER: The hydrocarbon wealth has allowed Gaddafi to live in a bubble. It's allowed him to make horrendous decisions, to make, you know, just abysmally bad government decisions, leadership decisions, with very few consequences for the viability of the state because he had this big cushion of oil revenue. Gaddafi built something called the Great Man-Made River, which was a canal which taps underground aquifers in the middle of the Sahara, deep in the south of the country. And then it pumped up the water from the underground aquifers and then sent it to Libya's urban centers along the coastline.

Well, some fundamental miscalculations - 1, he never built a roof over the Great Man-Made River, so it's open-air. So something like 70% of the water in the Great Man-Made River evaporates crossing the desert before it actually reaches the urban centers.

DAVIDSON: He didn't know the Sahara was a hot, dry place?

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

PORTER: Or maybe he just didn't understand evaporation. I don't know.

DAVIDSON: And I should say, just according to Wikipedia, the total cost is projected at more than $25 billion...

PORTER: Right.

DAVIDSON: ...Which is a lot.

PORTER: And I'm not sure if that's in today's dollars or not. Because it was constructed in the 1980s and '90s. And $25 billion in 1980 is considerably more than $25 billion today.

DAVIDSON: But you could just - I mean, it's laughable to think if President Obama said, I want to tap water around Phoenix... Right.

BLUMBERG: ...And transport it to - you know, to Kansas City, it'll cost $25 billion.

PORTER: Right.

DAVIDSON: And it'll be total - like, obviously, in our system of government...

BLUMBERG: And 70% the water won't get there.

DAVIDSON: Yeah.

PORTER: I mean, you know, in another context, the population probably would have been hugely dissatisfied, would have risen up earlier. There would've been other pressures that Gaddafi would have had to respond to - the vested interests of stakeholders in a Libyan economy, were it a real economy. But it's not a real economy. It's a monolithic economy.

BLUMBERG: So for a minute, put yourself in Gaddafi's shoes here. You clearly really like power. You call yourself the King of Africa. And the one thing you're worried about is that someone will amass enough power to rival your authority. And so you have an active interest in making sure there's not many ways for regular people to get power or money. You want oil to be the only source of money. So if you see anyone with potential, you try and derail them. We talked to Mansour El-Kikhia. He's a Libyan who teaches political science and geography at the University of Texas in San Antonio. And he said this actually happened to a relative of his.

MANSOUR EL-KIKHIA: My nephew graduated from the University of Exeter in England, OK? And he was brilliant. He became the first in his class at the university where he was studying in Benghazi. Because he was in Exeter, he came back to Benghazi. And the university, his teachers and the school nominated him for a scholarship to go and do his Ph.D. at Oxford, OK? Gaddafi said no. He was put in a cement factory.

BLUMBERG: What?

DAVIDSON: What did he do in the cement factory?

EL-KIKHIA: My question exactly. What's he doing in the cement factory? Nothing. Because there...

DAVIDSON: And does he work, or he just shows up and puts his coat up?

EL-KIKHIA: He just shows up. And then at the end of the month, he gets his money, and that's it.

DAVIDSON: And he reads books or whatever he does?

EL-KIKHIA: He reads books over there. I mean, that's what they do. They read books.

BLUMBERG: I spent a year in the former Soviet Union right before the wall came down and everything changed there. And this reminds me very much of that, where nobody - everybody had a job, but nobody...

EL-KIKHIA: (Laughter) No work.

BLUMBERG: They didn't do anything. And it's a very weird feeling. It felt like - when I was there, it felt like there was this - it gives this strange attitude to everybody there, where they all realize that everything is fake that they're doing.

EL-KIKHIA: Exactly. Exactly.

DAVIDSON: Now, see Kikhia's family's a bit of a special case. They were powerful leaders in an earlier time in Libya's history in the part of the country that's least loyal to Gaddafi. So Gaddafi might have paid special attention to them. But what we've heard from lots of Libyans is, this sort of derailment happens everywhere. Unlike other states, where the government really wants the people to find ways to make money, Gaddafi works really, really hard to make sure that he is the only source of wealth.

So Gaddafi nationalized all the industries. There's very little private ownership in Libya. He set up a not-terribly-well-functioning welfare state, where he provides the food for the people. He provides the services, the basic services that they demand, like water and electricity and healthcare. And what this means is there's just not that many jobs outside of the government. For most people, there really is just not much to do every day.

EL-KIKHIA: There is no work in Libya. This is a society that does not produce. I mean, this is a rentier economy. The wealth is mined. And he is like a drip-drip feed. He drips one drip at a time in people's mouths. But there is no work. There is no production. There's...

DAVIDSON: So what do people do with their days?

BLUMBERG: Yeah. What do people do?

EL-KIKHIA: They don't. That's exactly it. I mean, here. Listen to me. It's over close to between 40% unemployment. People don't work. And people who do work don't work. They go to offices. They don't work. And so they...

DAVIDSON: Because there's no productive use of the economy.

EL-KIKHIA: There's no productivity.

DAVIDSON: There's no demand on them. Yeah.

EL-KIKHIA: Exactly. There's no productivity. What happens is most people - and this is, again, thanks to Gaddafi - they take two jackets with them to work. One jacket they put on a hanger, and one jacket they wear, so they can go and work somewhere else, either in a farm or do something - or taxi or something, so they can get money. And you, as a citizen, come to get something done in the governmental department, wherever it is. You say, what - is this person here? Oh yes, he's here. His coat is right there. You see? He's somewhere in the building. And so you wait for five hours. Never shows up (laughter), you know? And this - and so you come the next day, and the same thing keeps on and on and on.

But here's the thing. Here's the other thing. Here is the funny thing. You know, the society works on friendship, on friends. For example, I want - I go to a bank, OK? And the first thing I do is I look up and see, do I know somebody here in the bank who could help me? Because if I don't know anybody in the bank, I can't get my - anything done.

(LAUGHTER)

DAVIDSON: You're not going to get any banking done that day.

EL-KIKHIA: Any banking done.

(LAUGHTER)

EL-KIKHIA: No banking done.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in Arabic).

BLUMBERG: So here we are. We have this rentier state. Gadhafi controls all the money, keeps all potential rivals as powerless as possible. And yet the protests continue.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in Arabic).

BLUMBERG: Here's analyst Geoff Porter.

PORTER: You know, what's been shocking, I think, to a lot of commentators and a lot of analysts of Libya, myself included, is I had anticipated that there would be a popular protest in Benghazi. Gadhafi would deploy his military. They would shoot a couple hundred protesters. And the protesters would then cower and go back to their homes, and that would be that.

But what's been amazing - and to their credit - is the willingness of the Libyans to actually sacrifice themselves and to keep pushing on this at this moment. And it's just - it's been stunning to me that Libyans are willing to stand in front of Gadhafi's guns and get shot and be killed and continue to try and push him from power. And that's been amazing. And the big question for me is whether Gadhafi recognizes that it's different this time.

BLUMBERG: Why do you think that's happening? Why is it different this time?

PORTER: I don't know. I don't know. It may simply be enough. You know, not only is Gadhafi the longest-ruling Middle Eastern leader at 42 years. With Fidel Castro's resignation, he's also the longest-ruling living leader in the world at 42 years. He took over when he was 27. For the last 42 years, for all - for his - almost his entire adult life, he's been the leader of Libya.

BLUMBERG: Even if Gadhafi falls, there's danger. There's a reason it's called the resource curse. In a rentier economy, there's one big prize. So whoever takes Gadhafi's place if he goes down is facing the same incentives. Like Gadhafi, if they control the oil, they won't need the people. So any dictatorial tendencies that a successor might have - they can thrive in this situation.

DAVIDSON: Now, there are rentier states that have broken this curse. But there's not many. Norway always comes up. People talk about Botswana, which has a lot of diamond wealth. Some people talk about Louisiana and Alaska. Residents of those states can tell us if they have, in fact, broken the resource curse. And the model these successful states have is to find ways to take that resource wealth and divvy it up among the people. So the people have control of that money, and that creates a much healthier relationship between the citizens and their governmental leaders.

BLUMBERG: Right. It's not concentrated in the hands of a few autocrats. So if they figure out how to do that in Libya, a big if, then, Geoff Porter says, this rentier economy might actually work in Libya's favor, give Libya an advantage that most post-dictatorship economies don't really enjoy. So if you think of most sort of popular revolutions, there's this huge expectation placed on the new government to really improve the lives of the people in material ways, to really fundamentally raise their standard of living. And a lot of times, these expectations the new government just can't meet because the society just doesn't have the money.

DAVIDSON: Yeah. We've spent a lot of time - and a perfect example - in Haiti in the last year. You know, the Haitians overthrew a longstanding dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier, in 1986. And since then, the country is so desperately poor that no leader has been able to show, hey, I'm going to make your life better. So we've seen several coups depending on how you count, at least three. We've seen several governments collapse. And we've seen major governance issues.

BLUMBERG: Because in Haiti, it's a really long slog to get enough money to sort of improve the lives of the people. It's just sort of, like, year after year of sustained growth that they would need.

DAVIDSON: But in Libya, if they get some halfway decent governance, they have the money to really make it work.

PORTER: One positive aspect of all of this is that the hydrocarbon sector is actually run by technocrats, and they're reasonably competent at their jobs. So as long as they stay in the country and as long as they are - the oil infrastructure is protected and is not destroyed, as Gadhafi has now threatened to do, it's possible that Libya will continue to pump oil, and that will - again, just like Gadhafi benefited from a cushion of hydrocarbon revenue, the hydrocarbon revenue will give a new state the opportunity to - it'll give it some economic leeway, some fiscal leeway to explore new forms of government.

BLUMBERG: So what's happening in the rentier state of Libya is definitely attracting the attention of other rentier states in the region, most notably in Saudi Arabia, where the king there, King Abdullah, just this week announced he was making a, quote, "royal gift" to his people - $35 billion in increased health and unemployment benefits.

DAVIDSON: So he's gambling that if he spends a bit of the vast wealth he controls on the people, maybe he can pay them not to revolt.

BLUMBERG: Right, sort of like a rentier bribe to keep people in their homes.
