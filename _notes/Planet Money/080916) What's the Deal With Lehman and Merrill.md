event don't really affect ordinary people, unless global systemic effect
firm can't make money from helping lehman brothers
access to money in bank in question may affected for some time
if have stock than the value will be low
lehman brother have a lot of part, they are investment bank, match lender to lendee
but lehman held on to riskier asset, normaly sell to those that want but they held
merrill lynch is competitor, the next. so if lehman bankrupt they might too
other bank also have real asset, so not too affected
quantity of regulation not important, effective, smarter regulation does
some hedgefund, create complex system, financial expert spreading risk and thought have conquered risk, and completely collapse, they have finger on too many pie in the world
there is a posibility a run on bank on shadow bank system
no bank can survive a run on US have FDIC insurance, regular bank not too worried
the chadow banking system, like lehman brother, that lending system that too complex because too integrated on global basis
all things considered, on crisis have multiple contributor, politician always put off hard things to the future
