Two stories from our Indicator team about the sometimes-unlikely people who shape what we buy and what we do. | Subscribe to our weekly newsletter here.

A lot of us have a pretty naive view about ourselves. We think we're in control of what we like and the choices we make. In fact, there are whole industries of messengers and influencers who spend their days trying to shape what we buy and what we put into our bodies.

Today on the show, we have two stories from Planet Money's daily podcast, The Indicator, about these influencers. First, we hear how companies and governments are trying to persuade Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine, including the results of a recent big study that looked at pharmacy text messages encouraging patients to get vaccinated.

Then, we talk to the TikToker who has done what professional designers, fashion labels and global retailers have failed to do for decades: She made skinny jeans uncool.
