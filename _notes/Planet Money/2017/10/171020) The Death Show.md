Today on the show: death. We have four stories about how people prepare for death and what they leave behind for the living.

The dead don't have to do any work. For the rest of us, though, death is expensive and complex. There's real estate to be hunted, and coffins to be purchased, and insurance to be procured.

Sonari Glinton takes us to visit some of the most expensive real estate in the world, where supply is limited. The Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park is one of the most exclusive pieces of property in Los Angeles, the cemetery is nearly full, but customers keep coming to buried alongside stars like Marilyn Monroe and Natalie Wood.

#801: The Death Show

Meanwhile, in Japan, the death industry is changing. The population there is aging rapidly, so there are more customers on the way. But those people are spending less on funerals. Elise Hu visits Endex, a convention selling customers on the benefits of a glamorous funeral with personalized perks. She even tries being prepared for burial.

Plus, Planet Money editor Bryant Urstadt makes a case for tontines, a morbid mix of retirement plan and lottery. The winner gets a big payout when the other investors are dead. It used to quite popular.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, HOST:

I recently came to visit Los Angeles. And I called up my dear friend Sonari Glinton.

SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: Hey, how's it going?

VANEK SMITH: Good. Sonari, you are an NPR business correspondent. You live out here in LA. And we were going to get some food, and you told me that you were going to take me to see one of your favorite places in LA.

GLINTON: Yeah, where you can see the most celebrities in one, like, place possible.

VANEK SMITH: And I was thinking this meant we were going to go to some cool, new restaurant or a club or something like that.

GLINTON: Nope.

VANEK SMITH: But that is not where we ended up.

(LAUGHTER)

VANEK SMITH: Where are we right now?

GLINTON: We are in a little park that's hidden right off Wilshire Boulevard, which is one of the busiest streets in LA. And you can see there are skyscrapers sort of hiding what is one of my favorite places in the world.

VANEK SMITH: And what is it?

GLINTON: This is Pierce Brothers Westwood Memorial Park.

VANEK SMITH: It is a cemetery.

GLINTON: It is a cemetery - for real, for real.

VANEK SMITH: Sonari, you brought me to a cemetery (laughter). You really know how to show a girl a good time (laughter).

GLINTON: Well, I tell you - you know what? It's always a surprise.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

GLINTON: It is always a surprise. No one ever is like, oh, you took me to a cemetery. But, Stacey, this cemetery is special.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah, let's walk around.

GLINTON: So what do we got? You got first stop here, one of my favorite actors, Jack Lemmon.

VANEK SMITH: Why does it say Jack Lemmon in?

GLINTON: Because that's where he is. Get it? In?

VANEK SMITH: Oh.

GLINTON: He ain't never going out of there. Like, he's in. He's in.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Like, I'm in.

Wait.

GLINTON: Just moving quickly. There's somebody in there, but...

VANEK SMITH: I've never - you're so excited.

GLINTON: Oh, yeah. Here is the great writer Truman Capote, Jackie Collins...

VANEK SMITH: Oh, Natalie Wood.

GLINTON: But there is one celebrity that kind of outshines everyone.

VANEK SMITH: We're, like, walking towards the mausoleum.

GLINTON: And we turn the corner, and there's always some activity around it.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah.

GLINTON: There are always people. There's always flowers. There's always something.

VANEK SMITH: Marilyn Monroe.

GLINTON: Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Marilyn Monroe's is very simple. It almost couldn't be more simple, except for all the kiss marks.

Marilyn's grave is covered in these lipstick kisses. Apparently, people come up and kiss her grave every day. There was also a bouquet of roses, a pair of sunglasses and a piece of lemon cake that somebody left there. But, Sonari, you did not want to linger at Marilyn. You wanted to take me to see someone else.

GLINTON: Yes, one of my favorite - absolute favorite - people is buried there. And there's a little ritual that I have to perform. We have to find a stone or - here. So we're going to show some respect to my one of my favorite comedians. This man was Jewish. This is a tradition, Stacey, where you place a stone on a Jewish person's grave as a sign of remembrance. For Rodney Dangerfield. And you have to read his tombstone while I place this stone here.

VANEK SMITH: His inscription is there goes the neighborhood.

GLINTON: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

VANEK SMITH: Rodney Dangerfield was not kidding. This is a very exclusive neighborhood.

GLINTON: It's one of the most expensive graveyards in the world. One plot costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

VANEK SMITH: And that is for a space that is 6 feet by 8 feet.

GLINTON: Yeah. By that measure, that makes it some of the most expensive real estate in the world.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARC FERRARI AND MICHAEL MCGREGOR'S "SIGH")

GLINTON: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Sonari Glinton.

VANEK SMITH: And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith. Death - the great mystery. It connects and unites us all. It has inspired some of the greatest works of art and literature. And in a lot of ways, it defines and shapes our lives.

GLINTON: But it is also a business.

VANEK SMITH: And, wait, how much did you say the average funeral costs now?

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's over $10,000 for a traditional burial.

VANEK SMITH: Wow. It's expensive to die.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It is expensive to die.

VANEK SMITH: Today on the show, we look at three different parts of the death business.

GLINTON: Because as Rodney Dangerfield would tell you, dying ain't fun, and it ain't cheap, either.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARC FERRARI AND MICHAEL MCGREGOR'S "SIGH")

VANEK SMITH: For our first story we're going to look at buying a cemetery plot. And, Sonari, because you love the Westwood Cemetery so much, I looked around and found the guy who could sell you a space there.

GLINTON: Oh, woo-hoo.

BARON CHU: Hi. My name is Baron Chu with Plot Brokers.

VANEK SMITH: So you're basically like a real estate agent for grave plots.

CHU: It's very similar, yes.

VANEK SMITH: Baron buys cemetery plots from people. They move or change their mind about where they want to be buried. And the spot he has in your cemetery, Sonari - it's actually two spots. It is a double plot right in the middle of all these celebrities. And it costs - get ready for it - $600,000.

GLINTON: Oh my (laughter). That is a lot of money. This guy get his friends together - they could probably have a reality show. Crypts and Mausoleums of the Rich and Famous, maybe.

VANEK SMITH: I would watch that show. Baron's family has been in this business for more than 80 years. He says it is a very solid business. Demand is stable. And there is a lot of money involved. Baron's most expensive property right now is a crypt that is going for more than a million dollars.

What are the amenities that it offers? Like, why does it cost so much?

CHU: Private entrance, one of a kind, you know, 18-foot ceilings, marble from floor to ceiling, family name as big as a freeway sign.

GLINTON: Stacey, in Hollywood, even in death, billing - still important.

VANEK SMITH: Always.

GLINTON: But this cemetery - it's already at 95 percent capacity, so it's really expensive and really hard to get in.

VANEK SMITH: And Baron says in cities like Los Angeles and New York, businesses like his are always booming. Many cities are growing. Populations are getting bigger. Cemeteries are filling up. And more and more people are coming to him asking for help finding space.

GLINTON: And cemetery real estate is different from, say, home real estate in one very big way. You never move.

VANEK SMITH: Thanks, Sonari.

GLINTON: You are welcome. Bye.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

VANEK SMITH: So you have your cemetery plot. But when are you going to need it? That question brings us to our second story because none of us knows when we are going to die. And this causes all kinds of problems - existential, of course, but also practical. For instance, it's hard to know how much money you need to save. You don't want to scrimp and scrimp your whole life only to die before you've had a chance to spend any of it. You also don't want to spend and spend and then live to be 112. So these days, we have things like 401(k)s and life insurance to help us out with these problems. But that was not always the case. And Bryant Urstadt, editor of PLANET MONEY, you have a tale for us.

BRYANT URSTADT, BYLINE: I have a tale and a plan, a strange, old plan.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Tell us about it.

URSTADT: PLANET MONEY - the ten of us - we each pony up a thousand dollars.

VANEK SMITH: That's a lot.

URSTADT: It's enough. We bury it in the park. And we wait. And after everyone but one of us has died, that...

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter) Oh, my gosh.

URSTADT: That person, hopefully me - you - you.

VANEK SMITH: Uh-huh. Hopefully me. Sure (laughter).

URSTADT: Hopefully me or you - one of us - gets all of the money.

VANEK SMITH: OK. So this idea of yours just sounds like a messed-up lottery.

URSTADT: It is. But it's actually a kind of deal that went on for centuries. And it is called a tontine.

VANEK SMITH: A tontine?

URSTADT: A tontine.

VANEK SMITH: OK.

URSTADT: It was invented by a man named Lorenzo de Tonti.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, Tonti, tontine - got it.

URSTADT: Exactly. And this is how he set it up.

VANEK SMITH: OK.

URSTADT: He wanted the money to go to the government. And he said, listen, PLANET MONEY investors, don't bury in the park. Give it to me, give it to the government. And we will pay you an interest payment once a year. And as the investors in the tontine die off, the interest payments get bigger for the remaining investors.

VANEK SMITH: Oh.

URSTADT: So this way, you and I would get a regular payment. And even if everyone else was gone, we would be getting money.

VANEK SMITH: So if Jacob Goldstein mysteriously disappears.

URSTADT: Let's say.

VANEK SMITH: For instance. We would get a little extra money.

URSTADT: We would get a little extra money.

VANEK SMITH: Was this popular? Were there a lot of these?

URSTADT: They were all over the place. And one of them for a while was the building that housed the New York Stock Exchange. It was...

VANEK SMITH: Really?

URSTADT: Yeah. It was founded around 1794 by 200 people who got together and said, let's each put in two hundred dollars. We'll build the building. We'll run it. And the survivors - the survivor - will own it. And when it shut down, it was a big deal. And everybody was like, oh, the tontine is over. The famous tontine is over.

VANEK SMITH: Who won? Who got the building?

URSTADT: It was somebody with a very fancy, old New York name.

VANEK SMITH: Of course.

URSTADT: The people who always win.

VANEK SMITH: So OK. These were apparently huge. But I don't know - what happened to them? Are there still tontines today?

URSTADT: Well, there were - no. There were some problems. What happened was...

VANEK SMITH: OK.

URSTADT: ...The insurance companies got into the business. And they started offering tontines in a kind of professional way. And people joined up. And there was all this invested money sitting in piles. And people didn't really do that good a job taking care of it. And...

VANEK SMITH: It's tempting. There's a whole pile of money.

URSTADT: It was a little too tempting. And some people lived a long time and found out at the last moment, if you know what I mean, that someone had run off with all the money.

VANEK SMITH: Oh.

URSTADT: So tontines became essentially illegal.

VANEK SMITH: But you're hoping to bring them back at PLANET MONEY.

URSTADT: Think about it this way. It's kind of a nice thing. Like, it's something you do with someone you trust. And you kind of make an agreement that, in a way, is good for everyone. And it's - I think there's a kind of sweetness to it.

(SOUNDBITE OF JACOPO TITTARELLI RUBBOLI'S "WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA")

VANEK SMITH: Thank you, Bryant.

URSTADT: You're welcome.

(SOUNDBITE OF JACOPO TITTARELLI RUBBOLI'S "WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA")

VANEK SMITH: Our third and final business-of-death story comes to us from overseas. Sally Helm, PLANET MONEY producer, hello.

SALLY HELM, BYLINE: Hello.

VANEK SMITH: You have the story for us.

HELM: Yes, we are going to Japan. And Japan is a really good place to talk about death because it is one of the fastest-aging societies in the world right now. I talked to Elise Hu about this. She covers Japan for NPR. And she was like, oh, yeah.

ELISE HU, BYLINE: There's a lot of old people in Japan.

HELM: (Laughter).

HU: And it's noticeable when you walk around, especially rural areas.

HELM: So what does that mean for the funeral industry?

HU: Well, you would think it would be a good thing, right?

HELM: Yeah.

HU: You would - that would be the kind of intuitive response. But what's happening is that there's kind of a larger trend against spending as much money on funerals and having smaller funerals.

HELM: There are a couple reasons for that trend. One kind of sad one is that if you die older, you have fewer friends around to come to your funeral. So what's happening in Japan is that on the one hand, there are more funerals. But on the other hand, people are spending less on each one. So the funeral and death business in Japan has gotten really, really competitive. And there have been these big expos where death businesses come together to basically show their stuff, show why people should choose them. And Elise went to one of those conventions.

HU: It's called ENDEX. It's short for End of Life Expo.

HELM: (Laughter) Nice.

HU: And it's a gathering of all end-of-life-related businesses - so coffin builders, altar makers, morticians. There was an entire section on pets.

Turn your pet remains into a memory sapphire.

There were a bunch of hearses on display. There was this real blinged-out hearse, for example.

Why would you need a party bus after death?

HELM: Now, Stacey, Elise did not just go to this expo.

VANEK SMITH: OK.

HELM: She actually participated in it. There was a mortician there who wanted to show off his skills in traditional Japanese burial practices. And Elise agreed to be his model.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, my God (laughter).

HU: The big climax for me at ENDEX was an opportunity to actually have an undertaker pretend that I was dead and dress me in the traditional funeral garb and put me in a coffin.

HELM: Elise said the undertaker wrapped her in a kimono, left side over right side, the way he would do it for the dead, and applied makeup. And all of this was in front of a big audience.

HU: There's a real ritual to all of this. And so while I was pretending to be dead and getting prepared for my coffin, this undertaker was also on display, right? We were on stage. And so there was somebody narrating what he was doing as we were doing this.

HELM: Elise said the undertaker was very gentle. It seemed like he really knew what he was doing.

HU: When we were all finished, there was applause, you know, for the ritual mortician.

(APPLAUSE)

HELM: I have a photo of this in front of me, and it's amazing. Elise has on makeup. She's in this coffin that has clouds on it. And, you know, if death is a business, in this case, Elise became the product. And she told me that the experience wasn't really spiritual for her. If she was in touch with anything larger than herself, it was the commercial side of death which ultimately unites us all.

(SOUNDBITE OF CLAUDE PELOUSE'S "DANGEROUS TREASURES")

VANEK SMITH: That is so true. Stick around after the credits. The show is not dead yet. We have one final thought after this.

HELM: We love to hear what you think of the show, and we really love to get your story ideas. So send us an email - planetmoney@npr.org. Or find us on Facebook or Twitter.

VANEK SMITH: Today's episode was produced by the great Nick Fountain and Sally Helm. And, also, we have a couple people we'd like to thank - Professor Jonathan Forman at the University of Oklahoma and Amber Carvaly with Undertaking LA. Thanks, guys.

HELM: Also, if you want to see some pictures of Elise in her coffin, those will be up on our website, npr.org/money. And there will actually be video of this whole thing for Elise's Elise Tries series on NPR. It's an awesome series. Definitely check that out.

VANEK SMITH: PLANET MONEY'S senior producer is Alex Goldmark. The show is edited by Bryant Urstadt. I'm Stacey Vanek Smith.

HELM: And I'm Sally Helm. Thanks for listening.

Stacey, I have one last person that I want you to meet.

VANEK SMITH: OK.

MIKE MCHUGH: He's not around. Hello?

HELM: Hi.

MCHUGH: Hello?

HELM: Hi. So, sorry, he's not around?

MCHUGH: Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm talking about a dead person. Who's this?

HELM: (Laughter) This is Sally.

MCHUGH: Oh, hi.

HELM: (Laughter).

VANEK SMITH: I hate it when that happens.

(LAUGHTER)

HELM: Stacey, this is Mike McHugh (ph). He is a cemetery commissioner...

VANEK SMITH: OK.

HELM: ...In a small town in Massachusetts. So he runs the municipal cemeteries. He keeps track of who's buried where. He spends a lot of time with grieving families.

VANEK SMITH: So he's really dealing with a lot of different sort of logistical aspects of death.

HELM: Yes, the really practical parts in this small town. And he's been doing it since he was 18 years old.

VANEK SMITH: Wow.

HELM: So I thought he would be the perfect person to ask this question that, for me, has been kind of hanging over the whole show, which is, if you're dealing with death in this practical way, does that make it easier for you to deal with your own mortality? So I asked him.

Do you feel like you've learned things about death that you didn't know?

MCHUGH: I've learned a lot of the technical aspects of it. I didn't realize, say, that a casket goes inside of a vault. And when it goes in the ground I thought they just went straight into the ground themselves.

HELM: Do you think - I mean, like, has it changed how you, like, think about death, do you think?

MCHUGH: No, I'm still terrified.

(LAUGHTER)

MCHUGH: I'm as terrified of it as I was before.

VANEK SMITH: So I guess no matter how often you deal with death or however many of the practical parts of death you're dealing with every day, it's still just the great existential question.

HELM: Yeah. I think that never goes away.
