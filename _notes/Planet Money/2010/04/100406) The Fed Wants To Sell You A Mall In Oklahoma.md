The Federal Reserve owns the biggest mall in Oklahoma, and it's looking to sell. The mall is one of the many, many assets the Fed bought to bail out Bear Stearns a few years back. The assets were bundled into a special company called Maiden Lane I. Also on the bank's shopping list: A bundle of home mortgages that's closely related to Toxie, Planet Money's toxic asset. (Does that make us, like, in-laws with the Fed?) For the most part, the Fed owns financial stuff like loans and swaps. The assets it bought as part of the Bear bailout included a mortgage on the Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma City. When the owners of the mall defaulted on the mortgage, the Fed foreclosed. So if you're looking to buy yourself a mall in Oklahoma, you might check out Crossroads. As the listing notes, "this lender owned distressed asset ... can be purchased at far below replacement cost." It includes an AMC theater as well as a "former JC Penney (vacant)," and a "former Steve & Barry's (vacant)."

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "MEET THE PRESS")

CHRISTINA ROMER: There's just been a tremendous increase in the labor force for the last three months - or over the last three months, we've added more than a million people to the labor force. And that's actually - that's a great sign. That's a sign that people that might have been discouraged, dropped out because of the terrible recession, have started to have some hope again and are looking for work again.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, HOST:

Hello and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

And I'm Alex Blumberg. Today is Tuesday, April 6. And that was White House Chief Economic Adviser Christina Romer you heard at the top talking about jobs on NBC's "Meet The Press" this weekend. Today on the show, the U.S. central bank gone rogue.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: It's been hitting shopping malls and tropical vacation destinations all over the world.

JOFFE-WALT: But first, get your papers ready. Alex, our indicator?

BLUMBERG: It is a big one - $29,816,000,000. But let's just round it up to $30 billion.

JOFFE-WALT: Thirty billion is good. And $30 billion is the value of Maiden Lane I. That is the name that the Federal Reserve gave to a bunch of mortgages and loans and other weird financial instruments that it grudgingly agreed to take onto its books in 2008. So 2008, especially the spring, was a very dramatic time in the financial world. Bear Stearns, big New York investment bank, was on the brink of failure and the government really didn't want that to happen. So JPMorgan, under pressure from the U.S. government, took over Bear Stearns.

BLUMBERG: But part of the - but part of that agreement between JPMorgan and the U.S. government was that JPMorgan was saying, hey, we don't want a lot of these assets that Bear has - the bad stuff - you take that. And so, the Fed did. It gave JPMorgan about $30 billion. And in exchange, the Fed got a bunch of unhealthy assets - assets nobody wanted - and it stuffed them all into a portfolio that it named Maiden Lane I.

JOFFE-WALT: There's actually three Maiden Lanes. Maiden Lane, apparently, is a street near the New York Fed. And Maiden Lane I that we've been talking about, that was the Bear Stearns assets. The other two were assets the Fed got from AIG. So altogether, almost $75 billion worth of what, exactly?

BLUMBERG: Well, last week, we got a chance to find out, because after lawsuit by Bloomberg News, the Fed finally released that information. What are the assets that it's holding in Maiden Lanes I, II and III? And that, Chana, is what we'll be discussing today on the show. We'll be digging into those assets and finally revealing the answer to this 2-year-old mystery.

JOFFE-WALT: Yes. It's been something we've all been very eager to know. And it turns out that getting a look inside these portfolios actually tells a really powerful story about a central bank that has transformed dramatically in the last two years. So we're going to start with Vincent Reinhart. He's a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and he's been poring over Maiden Lane. We talked a lot about Maiden Lane I, the Bear Stearns assets. And he says it's been really interesting. It's actually even been sort of fun.

VINCENT REINHART: Because it's a grab bag. There's a lot of Hilton properties, a lot of things I've never heard of or never stayed at. You know...

JOFFE-WALT: The Hilton Hawaiian Village, the Hilton of Puerto Rico.

REINHART: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: The...

REINHART: The Maldives, by the way. I...

JOFFE-WALT: The Maldives are on here, yeah. We've got the Hilton of Malaysia. We've got...

REINHART: Yeah.

JOFFE-WALT: ...The Hilton in Trinidad.

REINHART: Yeah. Yeah. So we got Houston, Danbury, Moorpark, Nashville, Brownsville, Irving. There are mortgages and hotels in Boston, Colorado Springs, Jacksonville, Fla. Just like you might have a mortgage on your house, the bank who holds the mortgage has this claim on you. The Fed has a claim on a hotel in Jacksonville, Fla.

JOFFE-WALT: The Fed is the bank.

REINHART: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: Why are there so many hotels?

REINHART: And it just so happens that Bear Stearns was holding a number of them in the process of securitization. So basically, what happened was somewhere along the line, a bank made an initial mortgage. It sold that mortgage to somebody else. Somebody else sold that mortgage to somebody else. Ultimately, Bear Stearns acquired it. And at that moment in time, that was when Bear Stearns ran into trouble and the Fed lent money to Bear Stearns and took that mortgage as collateral.

JOFFE-WALT: And why did Bear Stearns have that mortgage in the first place?

REINHART: Probably because it was going to securitize it. You pool those mortgages together and then you issue a security that uses them as backing. So Bear Stearns was at the second step. They acquired some mortgages. They were about to issue them as a security. It hadn't gotten that far, though.

JOFFE-WALT: So these hotels were all being bought up. The Hilton in, you know, the Maldives and the hotel in Jacksonville, in Colorado Springs, in Boston, they were buying them all up. And this is, like, frozen in time. Bear Stearns was about to...

REINHART: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Slice them all up and put them into a bunch of different securities, into complex financial...

REINHART: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: ...Products and sell them. But they collapsed before they could do that. And the Fed has ended up with them.

REINHART: Right. Exactly. So it's a game of musical chairs. The music stopped and there were, you know, Bear Stearns was left standing with some of these things.

JOFFE-WALT: So the music stops. And the music stopping is a big reason why JP Morgan does not want these assets. It was at this moment where the U.S. is negotiating with JP Morgan to take on Bear Stearns. And they're thinking about it, but they don't want the Miami Airport and the Hiltons and all these assets that Bear was planning to securitize because securitizing real estate products at this point is not going so well. So the government wanted the JP Morgan thing to work out. So the Fed took on all those products.

BLUMBERG: Right. And that is a big, huge step for the Fed. Because the Federal Reserve, up until this point, it has been one of the most boring investors out there. It traditionally bought one type of investment - treasuries from the U.S. government. And this moment, it went from being a boring central bank to being more like a regular bank, taking on risk.

JOFFE-WALT: Does that mean that the Hilton in Chicago and San Francisco and the Miami Airport and the Jacksonville Hotel every month are writing mortgage checks and they're sending them to some sort of in-between person, and the in-between person is putting them in an envelope and sending them to the Federal Reserve?

REINHART: Yeah. They're doing the electronic equivalent.

JOFFE-WALT: Now, that's a strange position for the Fed to be in.

REINHART: You know what's even stranger? What would happen if one of those entities - don't want to name anyone in particular since this is a hypothetical - but what would happen if one of them actually failed? That is, stop making payments and it was time for the servicer to foreclose. The Federal Reserve could wind up owning a hotel in an airport. Or a hotel out, you know, overlooking a golf course.

Because that's what happens after foreclosure. First, you're delinquent. Then you go into default. Then the bank forecloses on you. The bank owns the property. Similarly, if one of those hotels stops paying its regular mortgage payment, ultimately it could go into foreclosure and the Federal Reserve will own it, or a piece of it.

JOFFE-WALT: So there is a mall in this portfolio that I believe has gone into bankruptcy.

REINHART: Where is it? This is Maiden Lane I, right?

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, it's in Maiden Lane I.

REINHART: What's the name of it?

JOFFE-WALT: Crossroads.

REINHART: OK. Crossroads? Crossroads Mall in Oklahoma, actually, isn't it? Oh, real estate. Yeah, it owns it. Right? REO means real estate owned.

JOFFE-WALT: So the Fed owns that mall?

REINHART: Yeah. Maiden Lane.

JOFFE-WALT: So the Fed is now in the commercial shopping business.

REINHART: Yeah. So a modest proposal would be for the Fed to support the businesses it owns. It could have its employees shop at the Crossroads mall or take vacations in Colorado Springs or the Maldives.

JOFFE-WALT: But they should actually give us all discounts at the Crossroads Mall.

REINHART: That would be great. So if you pay in cash, in bank notes, which happened to be - have the Federal Reserve name on the front, then you should get a discount.

JOFFE-WALT: Exactly.

REINHART: Because that works - that helps both sides of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Currency is a liability of the Fed Reserve. And if you're going to use it more, the Fed Reserve generates more seigniorage. And if you use it by supporting some of the assets it holds...

JOFFE-WALT: It's good for them on both sides.

REINHART: ...All the more better. So if you're driving down a strange city and you see pay by cash at this hotel, you'll know it's not a short-stay hotel; it's something perhaps owned by the Federal Reserve.

BLUMBERG: So, Chana, when he says currency is a liability to the Fed, that's sort of a strange idea. So let's just explain that. Basically, every dollar that you have in your wallet, that's basically an IOU from the Fed. That means that to the Fed, you could show up at any time, present your dollar and they would have to give you a dollar's worth of something in return, a dollar's worth of some asset that they have on their balance sheet.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So used to - you can think about it. It used to be gold. Used to be able to show up in and get gold until very recently it was Treasury bonds. And now I guess it's a piece of a mall in Oklahoma.

BLUMBERG: Or it could be something else because aside from this jaunt into retail and tropical vacation destinations, the Fed is now involved in insurance. Although not regular insurance, but this special kind of insurance called credit default swaps.

JOFFE-WALT: That's your favorite, Alex.

BLUMBERG: It is.

JOFFE-WALT: We always come back to credit default swaps. CDS, you may remember, is a strange form of insurance contracts that became quite popular in the last several years.

BLUMBERG: And the fact that the Fed now owns them is sort of crazy. Basically, here's how this would have worked. So, for example, listed in Maiden Lane I, there's a California state - a credit default swap on California state and school districts in Florida. Some school district in Florida, let's say Dade County, Dade County decides it wants to build a new school. It sells bonds to do that. Someone buys those bonds and then the buyer of those bonds maybe gets worried thinking, like, I don't know. Dade County is in trouble. Maybe they're not going to be able to pay me my bond back.

So this buyer would then buy protection, a credit default swap - insurance in case that the school Dade County defaults, someone else would have to pay them the value. So in our hypothetical scenario, the person that they got that protection from, that was Bear Stearns.

JOFFE-WALT: But, of course, 2008, Bear Stearns is gone. So the person who assumed other obligations, the U.S. Fed. Which means that if Florida schools go down and they can't repay that bond, the Fed takes a loss.

BLUMBERG: But not to worry, Chana, because it gets even stranger. The Fed is actually on the other side of this kind of contract, too. It has CDS listed here for California, where if the California bond defaults, the Fed would receive a payment.

REINHART: So your central bank, you know, is writing insurance and collecting insurance premiums.

JOFFE-WALT: And what? So - OK.

REINHART: Mind bending, isn't it?

JOFFE-WALT: It is a little mind bending. I mean, this is unique for the Fed, but it's not unique for an investment bank.

REINHART: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: This mimics what Bear Stearns would have had.

REINHART: Right. This was a slice of the poor portion of Bear Stearns's portfolio on March 15, I guess it would be, 2008.

So actually, you should have the image of Chairman Ben Bernanke flying to a speaking engagement. And he can look out the window and look down and say, boy, I own a piece of that. I own a piece of that. I own a piece of that. And that's the way the Fed's balance sheet is right now.

BLUMBERG: It's really crazy - hotels, malls, Credit default swaps on Florida schools. And actually, Chana, there's one other thing in here that - one other asset that the Fed now owns that jumped out at us.

JOFFE-WALT: Yes, that would be the HVMLT 06 listed on page 76.

BLUMBERG: HV MLT has a special place in our hearts here at PLANET MONEY because HVMLT is the real name for our own little Toxie.

JOFFE-WALT: That's right, our toxic asset. So regular listeners here know we recently became toxic asset investors, apparently like the Fed. PLANET MONEY bought a nice, messy little residential mortgage-backed security and you all named her Toxie. But Toxie's formal name is HVMLT 05. It stands for the Harborview Mortgage Loan Trust, HVMLT. And that was the original name of the Wall Street security that Toxie is a part of.

BLUMBERG: And that's this thing that always strikes me as odd. These Wall Street banks would actually name these complicated financial securities that they were producing. And you can almost think of it like the way a car company names a line of car. So, for example, you know, as you know, I drive a 2005 Cadillac Escalade. But I could also get a 2006 Cadillac Escalade. The same thing...

JOFFE-WALT: That's funny. I didn't know you drove an '05. I drive an '06.

BLUMBERG: Oh, right, right. Exactly. So the same thing would happen with the Wall Street banks.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. So the Fed actually got the '06 vintage of our Harborview Mortgage Loan Trust. Toxie is from 2005. So it's not the same exact houses that are in our toxic asset, but very similar kinds of homes. And it was put together by the exact same players.

BLUMBERG: We actually called Wit Solberg, our man at Mission Peak Capital, who helped us by Toxie. And we asked him how similar is what the Fed has to our Toxie. And he said, think of what the Fed owns as Toxie's younger sister.

WIT SOLBERG: It's very similar. You know, what they tried to do was be equally discriminant in the terribleness of the loans. So we...

JOFFE-WALT: So the Fed did basically buy what we bought.

SOLBERG: That's right. Just a year later.

BLUMBERG: It's just like - so we have a Toyota, they have a Toyota, but they have the 2006 model, and we have a 2005 model.

SOLBERG: Yeah. Interesting. Interesting for Toyota.

BLUMBERG: Except that it's not a Toyota. It's a Gremlin.

SOLBERG: You have an accelerator problem. They have a steering wheel problem.

The interesting comparison that I was able to distinguish between the two - 100% of the loans in the Fed's transaction were originated in 2006; 100% of yours were in 2005. And in 2006, the housing market and the loans within those bonds pinnacled. The performance of the loans in 2006 and the younger sister of this brand was a lot worse.

JOFFE-WALT: Toxetta.

SOLBERG: Toxie Jr.

JOFFE-WALT: Toxie Jr. So is - are we better off than the Fed or does the Fed have it worse off than us?

SOLBERG: It looks like it's neck and neck right now.

BLUMBERG: So Wit told us that, yes, Toxie has a younger sister in what the Fed owns. But Toxie, actually, it turns out, has lots of family in Maiden Lane. Not immediate family, but, you know, aunts, uncles, cousins.

SOLBERG: If you compare the other positions that are held by the Fed, a lot of them are very similar to Toxie in its makeup, meaning monster coming, you know, elimination in the near horizon.

BLUMBERG: And there's one other crucial difference between us and the Fed - we paid a penny on the dollar for Toxie. Did the - the Fed didn't get anywhere near that kind of deal, right?

SOLBERG: Well, you know, I'm not really quite sure how the Fed constructed its deal. I wasn't at the table on that day. The - but there was a negotiation at that time when Bear Stearns was becoming JP Morgan. And, you know, I'm sure Jamie Dimon took a look at this particular bond and said, no, thank you.

BLUMBERG: We won't buy this at really any price.

SOLBERG: Mr. Federal Reserve, I'm going to leave these to reporters at NPR to purchase. And as far as us taking the rest of Bear Stearns, you can have these in the positions like them. And that's largely what you see in some of these Maiden Lane portfolios.

BLUMBERG: Right.

SOLBERG: Cousins of Toxie and so forth are in them.

BLUMBERG: Now, my question for you is, if you were going to buy the whole thing now, how much would you offer?

SOLBERG: Well, with my own national sovereign reserve account?

BLUMBERG: Yes, exactly.

SOLBERG: OK. So here's - here are the facts that I know with 150 pieces of paper that have different bond names on them, and the Fed said that they were worth $30 billion in March of 2008. Is that right?

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

SOLBERG: All right. So then I know some of the bonds have gone away because they've paid down quickly. I believe in the Federal Reserve; I think that they would never give me a value that's too high. But I would discount them by 50% just in case because performance since then has been pretty bad. If I had to take a guess, I'd pay a third.

BLUMBERG: I love how Wit says I believe in them, but I discount them by 50%. Right. I believe in them 50%.

So what Wit is essentially saying is not only does the Fed own a bunch of toxic assets, it probably overpaid for those toxic assets, as well. Which, of course, is exactly what it wanted to be doing. It was trying to save the financial system, not drive a hard bargain and make money for itself. But in the meantime, our central bank has gone from being a boring, safe investor to investing in some of the wildest creations Wall Street ever made up - credit default swaps, mortgage-backed securities, crazy land deals in Florida, and, of course, Oklahoma.

(SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)

AUTOMATED VOICE: Thank you for calling the Crossroads Mall shopping line to expedite your call we have seven choices on the main menu.

BLUMBERG: Which brings us to the next step in this saga. Some of those assets, like our very own Toxie, are going to go bad. They will not be able to pay back what they owe. And one already has - that mall in Oklahoma that we discussed. That's what you're hearing right now, that outgoing message to that mall. And the Fed is now trying to sell that information.

JOFFE-WALT: So how does the Fed sell a mall? It hires someone. And this is really strange. So last year we talked to Jim Parrack. He's the senior vice president at Price Edwards and Company. It's a commercial real estate company in Oklahoma. And when we talked to Jim, he was having trouble filling retail space for the people that he was working for. His job this month? Sell a mall for the Federal Reserve of the United States.

BLUMBERG: Man, that must be a weird turn of events for him. So I guess the final question that we should address here, what are we supposed to think about the fact that the Fed now owns a bunch of stuff that will probably go bad or some portion of it will go bad? Is that a problem for us, the taxpayer? And there's - the answer is a little bit complicated.

To buy all these assets, the Fed essentially had to create a bunch of new money. And in normal times, when the Fed creates that much more money, it causes inflation. Inflation is bad for you and me. So far, though, that is not happening. So that's not a problem so far.

JOFFE-WALT: But there's another problem. So the Fed, you know, as we said, it used to be the most boring bank in the world. It would borrow our dollars, invest them in treasuries and make a small, steady profit each year. And that profit, profit that goes to us, the taxpayers, via the U.S. Treasury. And if that doesn't happen, we essentially lose money.

BLUMBERG: And that is the danger. It's not only on Maiden Lane that the Fed is gambling right now. The Fed has created over a trillion new dollars, which it is using to buy all sorts of stuff it never has in the past. Meaning, essentially, the Federal Reserve is very different today than it was before. It has a lot more risk and there's a lot more possibility that it won't make money back.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. We tend to end on cheery notes here. That's it for us today. You can see a flyer advertising the Fed's mall on our website, npr.org/money. You can write to us at planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Chana Joffe-Walt.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thanks for listening.
