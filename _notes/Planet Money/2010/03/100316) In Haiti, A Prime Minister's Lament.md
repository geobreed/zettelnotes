Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt, who've been reporting in Haiti, talk to Prime Minister Jean Max Bellerive. He runs the government's day-to-day affairs; President Rene Preval is the head of state. They interview Bellerive at his official residence, and while they're talking, a U.S. Army helicopter flies by. It's a reminder of the massive foreign presence in Haiti. And it's not just the military; all sorts of people from around the world looking at everything from Haiti's ports to its health-care system. But as plans for what Bellerive calls Haiti's "refoundation" get hashed out, there's some tension between the Haitian government and the international community.
