ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome - but not to PLANET MONEY, to the PLANET MONEY Deep Read.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

This is PLANET MONEY Deep Read 2, actually. This is the second time we're doing this. This is a new thing we're trying. It's an extra podcast in addition to our regularly scheduled Tuesday and Friday podcasts.

BLUMBERG: You can think of it as a PLANET MONEY bonus extra. The first one was a couple weeks ago with Ian Bremmer. And after that one, we asked all of you to write in and tell us what you thought. And you wrote in and said, we like it. Keep doing it. So here we are - number two. And the basic idea is we get all these books, and we talk to these, you know, big thinkers and people with big ideas. And it's fun to have just a broad-ranging conversation with these folks. And we want to share them with you when we do.

KESTENBAUM: So today we have a conversation you had, Alex, with Raghu Rajan. He is formerly the chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. Right now, he is a finance professor at the University of Chicago, the Booth School of Business there.

BLUMBERG: And he is also the author of a new book, "Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten The World Economy." You thought we were safe, didn't you?

KESTENBAUM: I did.

BLUMBERG: We are not. And, you know, Raghu isn't just some sort of Cassandra out there. He's actually sort of famous for predicting the financial collapse that we just went through.

KESTENBAUM: Right. He's famous among, like, finance guys.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Exactly. It's a special type of fame. I grant you that. And he is, well, quote, unquote, "famous" because of this paper he delivered at this fancy finance minister gathering they have every year in Jackson Hole, Wyo. And this was 2005, before any hint of the downturn. Everyone was there to celebrate Alan Greenspan as the greatest Fed chairman ever. And Raghu got up and presented this paper in which he said, you know what, guys? I've been studying bank risk data, and I think this whole thing could come crashing down.

KESTENBAUM: At the time, he got a pretty cold reception. But then, of course, three years later, things did fall apart pretty much the way he said they might.

BLUMBERG: And this brings us to the conversation he and I had. So Raghu's premise in the book is that the factors that caused the crisis we just went through are still at work and will lead to future crises. He calls these factors fault lines. And here's our conversation.

RAGHURAM RAJAN: The first fault line is growing inequality. Now, you know, inequality, when it reflects a lack of capability or opportunity, becomes quite detrimental. And that, I think, is the problem that the United States faces today. Technological progress has always, over the last 150, 200 years, required people to get more and more educated. So at around the turn of the 19th century, as it moved into the 20th century, it was people needed a high school education because now they were moving from the farms to big chemical factories, to big auto factories. And therefore, what happened was an enormous spurt in high school education in the United States as you got schools - you know, lots of schools opening and a change in the curriculum which actually produced the right kind of people.

What we've had more recently is the internet boom and, you know, the advent of computers and so on, all of which has required even higher education than high school education. But if you look at what's happening to the United States, the number of high school graduates has remained relatively stagnant since the 1970s. More worrisome, if you look at male graduates from universities, that is no different for people born in the 1940s as it is for people born in the 1970s. In other words, three decades hasn't changed the number of male college graduates, which is extremely worrisome when you think those three decades meant enormous changes in requirements of the labor market for skills.

Bottom line, there has been a stagnation in the wages of a significant part of the U.S. population. And the stagnation has been because we haven't improved the capabilities of those people. Now, where am I going? Why has all this got anything to do with the credit crisis? Well, if you look at emerging markets, when they deal with the problem of growing inequality and growing dissatisfaction of the population, the answer, typically, is hand out some goodies. Hand out some sweets so that - or let them eat cake so that the population feels happy, at least for a little while.

BLUMBERG: Even though it doesn't have a good job, it's still - at least the government is giving me this pension or this...

RAJAN: This extra pension - this is what happened in Greece. You kept the government workers happy by giving them more of a pension, you know, 14 months' worth of wages rather than 12 months', more holidays. So you don't pay as much attention to your paycheck when, in fact, your consumption is keeping up. And that's my point. Over the last 20, 25 years, the answer has been increasing borrowing so that you borrow in order to finance a better lifestyle, but in fact, you're going deeper and deeper into debt.

This is precisely what I think happened in the United States. And that's why the chapter which deals with this is called "Let Them Eat Credit." My mind, credit became the new way of redistribution. Now, housing was the one thing which actually seemed even better than just opening the floodgates to credit because with housing, if you can offer more credit to housing, people have a house, which is an asset, which lets them look forward into the future. Moreover, as the house price rises, you feel wealthier. You don't feel you're borrowing. You don't feel you're going deeper into hock. And this is ironic.

The government had the tools to encourage it precisely because it acquired those tools in dealing with the mess of the Great Depression. That is when we created the Federal Housing Authority, we created Fannie Mae. And these were the entities through which you pushed lending to low-income segments of the population. I think the intent was honorable. The intent was, in many ways, good, but the problem was the private sector took that intent and took us all over the cliff while driving that intent to its logical conclusion.

BLUMBERG: And so the basic argument is that, with - that this inequality doesn't allow people in - because there's this inequality - because people, for whatever reason, aren't graduating from college, aren't getting the skills they need to provide for themselves in this new - in a new economy - in a new sort of higher-skill economy, and because it's hard to reorganize your society to ensure that people - that everybody does graduate from college, that's the hard thing to do.

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: And that's what we eventually need to do because...

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: And so in lieu of doing that, what governments and politicians have done is tried to mask over the effects by lending people money to - so that they can live a lifestyle as if they had graduated from college, even though...

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...They aren't able to earn what they would have if they graduated from college.

RAJAN: Absolutely. It's credit as a palliative. And of course, it accords well with the fact that, at least in the short run, you can make feel - make people feel much happier. The problem is the bill has to be paid in the longer run.

BLUMBERG: Now, one of the other things that you talked about was that - there's a chapter of your book where you're talking about another - and this is in the - this is along the same lines. This is the same fault line as the rise in inequality. You're talking about - there's a lack of a social safety net in the United States. And that leads policymakers to - you lose your job in the United States. And the government, if it wants to try to respond - which it does because you're voting them out of office if they don't - it has basically one option, which is to lower interest rates and really, really try to get the economy ginned up again so that you can get your - get a job, because if you don't have a job, you don't have health care. You don't have - you know, you don't have savings.

Whereas, in other European countries, if you lose your job, the government isn't under as quite as much pressure to rev up the economy because you can withstand sort of a natural business cycle more because there's a longer - there's more benefits. Is that the argument?

RAJAN: So yes, it is. And it works as follows. I mean, the U.S. has historically had very sharp recoveries from recessions. So, you know, usually by about six months into the recovery, you've recovered all the growth that was lost. And eight months into the recovery, you've recovered all the jobs that were lost. Well, starting in 1991, the nature of the recoveries changed. In 1991, it took about three quarters for the growth to come back, but it took about 23 months - nearly two years - for the jobs to come back - the jobs that had been lost.

2001 was even worse. It took just one quarter for the growth to come back. It took 38 months - three years and some - for the jobs to come back. And my guess is this particular recovery is going to be potentially, as things trend, even worse than that. In other words, it'll take years - many years - for the jobs that we lost to come back fully. Now, why does this matter? It matters because the U.S. has a relatively thin safety net. It has about six months' unemployment insurance, after which you're on your own. And when you add to that the fact that many Americans don't have savings, it creates enormous anxiety in the population.

You have, then, a situation where you have an immense political pressure from the people who are unemployed, but also the people who fear that they will become unemployed, to do something to bring jobs back. But then the economy is not producing jobs, so what you have to do is stimulate, stimulate, stimulate until the jobs come back. So that is the focus of this chapter. What I say is, on the one hand, you've got fiscal policies - that is, government expenditures which are undertaken in response to recessions nowadays, which tend to be overblown, which tend to get at the wrong thing, which tend to try and promote the wrong kinds of expenditures, which ultimately hurt the health of the United States.

But more important is that you've got monetary policy which stays on hold forever, which is what is going on right now. Interest rates will not be raised until the jobs start coming back in full measure. But by the time the jobs come back in full measure, you have the financial sector taking enormous risks which put the entire system under peril.

BLUMBERG: Right. So you're saying, basically, without a - with a relatively weak social net, politicians, in order to respond to the concerns of the citizens about, you know, hey, am I going to be able eat? Am I going to have health care? Am I going to be able to - they have to use the tools at their disposal, which is sort of misdirected fiscal policy, which is basically what Congress does. And that is, like, either, you know, doing tax cuts like the homebuilder tax credits...

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...And that sort of thing or monetary policy, which is what the Fed does, which is what Greenspan did after - in 2001, where he was criticized for - in 2002 for leaving the Fed funds rate very, very low for a long time. And that - by many people, that's pointed to as one of the key - and we have pointed to it...

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...As well on our program as one of the key causes of the financial - of the housing bubble...

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: ...Which was these rates being kept low for a long time. But you're saying policymakers needed to do that because the jobs weren't coming back. And that was this sort of desperate attempt to try to get people working again because - which they needed to do because our social safety net isn't very strong.

RAJAN: Right. The problem is extremely distorted policies in response to the fact there's political pressure because people don't have a safety net.

BLUMBERG: Right. And now, of course, one of the other fault lines has to do with global imbalances.

RAJAN: Right.

BLUMBERG: You want to just...

RAJAN: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...Give a quick sketch now?

RAJAN: It's not easy to get excited about it. But I think it's deep problem. It's a deep problem. And the problem has to do with the way countries have grown. Now, you know, post-war, Japan, Germany, Korea, Taiwan, China all chose a way of growth - in fact, the only way, for the most part - that has proven successful, which is to focus on exports. Now, this has been extremely successful. No country has grown as fast as Japan did between 1950 and 1973. It grew at 8% per year per capita. The way it did that is by, you know, coddling a set of firms, giving them a whole lot of government benefits but then telling them, look, you need to go on and export.

And so, you know, you give them both carrot and stick. The carrot was the benefits the government gave. The stick was, go out and export. And when these countries did that, they could sort of exploit the whole world market. They got scale, and it was a very successful strategy. The problem that I point to is that while they exported, they also found that the domestic sectors tended to be much less efficient than the export sector - so extremely powerful and competitive export-led sector, extremely weak domestic sector. And what that has created, then, is a country that is dependent on exports both for growth but also in recessions, to come out of recessions, depends on somebody else spending. Now...

BLUMBERG: Somebody else spending.

RAJAN: Some other country spending - exactly.

BLUMBERG: And that typically has meant us, the United States.

RAJAN: Well, not always. In the '90s, it was the emerging markets. We talked about them earlier - the guys who were willing to, you know, do these populist policies that led to splurges. It was Latin America's, you know, India to some extent. A whole bunch of countries spent more than they produced, right? And so they were importing the difference financed through foreign capital from countries like Japan.

The problem was that that was not a very sustainable form of growth. And country after country in the emerging markets suffered a crisis in the 1990s. So they changed. The emerging market said, we're not going to do this again. We're going to be more sensible. And many of them turned into exporters themselves, adding to the flood of exports coming from countries like Japan and Germany that had historically been exporters.

Well, what you had in the 2000s is a new set of countries stepped up. Let me reel off the names - the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Latvia, Iceland. So long as you have these countries like Germany and Japan, which are focused on exporting their surpluses, you have to have countries like Greece and the United States buying much more than they can afford. And that, to my mind, is a central problem of the world economy, a problem that the United States was willing to succumb to because of the other forces we talked about - the inequality, the kind of need for stimulus to create jobs - all of which encouraged consumption in a downturn and led to the kind of spending which resulted in the crisis.

But going forward, you know, can the United States afford it? We've already seen in Europe that the peripheral European countries that ran large deficits now are saying, no more. Well, who's going to buy the stuff that Germany churns out? Now, Germany is acting, you know, as if it's done the right thing over the last so many years. And in some ways, it has. It has become much more competitive. But Germany could not be Germany without exporting its surpluses, which are bought by Italy, Spain, Portugal and so on. And so, you know, they are locked in a symbiotic, you know, debt dance, if you will, until Germany starts expanding its own demand.

And typically, by improving the productivity of its nontradeable sector - of its plumbers, of its shops and so on - it's not clear to me that we won't go through the cycle again and again of these surpluses looking for somebody willing to overspend.

BLUMBERG: Now, can we bring that to the level of sort of, like, an example here? So what you're saying is, are - German plumbers are worse than American plumbers?

RAJAN: No. I'm saying that the kinds of regulations that are in place in the domestic sector, less so for Germany, more so for Japan...

BLUMBERG: All right. Let's take Japan. What is...

RAJAN: OK. Let me give you an example. So Japanese haircuts are extremely expensive, OK? Part of the reason is, you know, productivity in the Japanese haircut sector is lower. So an upstart comes up and starts saying, I'm going to offer cheaper haircuts. That's the typical way competition, you know, pushes down prices. If you have cheaper haircuts, more Japanese will go get haircuts. And there will be more sort of activity in the haircutting sector, and you will get growth there.

Well, the startup provides cheaper haircuts, but the existing barbers get anxious because they'll have to cut prices. And they're perfectly happy where they are, fewer haircuts but, you know, getting more per haircut. And so the barber guild gets together and says, this is terrible. You know, this practice of offering haircuts - we have to find a way to nip it in the bud. And they have a brilliant idea. They say, well, offering haircuts without shampoos is unhygienic. It's a bad idea. So we're going to mandate that before every haircut, you have to offer a shampoo. Well, the nice thing is, all the existing barber shops are equipped with basins and so on where you can offer people a shampoo.

But that new startup, because it's cutting costs and because it's cutting frills, doesn't have a basin where you can have a shampoo. Well, in one stroke, by requiring a shampoo before a haircut, you've raised the cost of doing business for the startup. You've driven the startup, you know, to a corner, and typically, they can't compete anymore. And you've preserved the way of life for the existing barbers. In the process, you have far fewer haircuts in Japan than possibly if you allowed much more competition. You can see this play out in many sectors - transport, retail, construction - where a few incumbents sort of monopolize what's going on and don't allow the kind of growth that would allow Japan domestic sources of growth as distinct from the export-led sources of growth, which it typically relies on.

BLUMBERG: So tie the frustrated wannabe barber in Japan back to me.

RAJAN: All right.

BLUMBERG: What's the - now...

RAJAN: So...

BLUMBERG: ...What's the link?

RAJAN: ...The link is that Japan then relies primarily on exporting cameras to you for its growth, rather than seeing its barbers and its gardeners and its coffee shops surge in popularity. Net result is it needs you to spend in order for it to grow, right? Its surpluses are looking for a home. It's also willing to finance you. German banks were a big part of the financing of the subprime mortgage-backed crisis. They're willing to finance you. They're looking to place not just their goods, but also the money they make from selling those goods to you in your economy. And those pressures tend to add to whatever existing pressures you have.

So how does all this come together? You have the pressure on because of income inequality causing the government to send more credit to low-income segments. You have the foreign investors looking to buy U.S. securities and, again, willing to fund, for example, activity in the low-income segment because also their funding helps people then raise home equity loans, which then they go and buy, you know, Japanese cameras with. And the third aspect of this is even while this is going on, the Fed, which should be the natural guardian of this process and prevent this process from getting carried away, is happy to join the party keeping interest rates low because it fears that if it raises the interest rates, unemployment will soon shoot up all over the place.

And so you've got all these forces coming together saying, go out and spend and go out and borrow. And that takes the financial sector a long way towards the cliff. There are other forces, of course, in the book that I talk about, but that should give you a picture of what's going on.
