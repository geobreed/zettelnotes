We take you to Denmark, land of bicycles, pigs, Ikea-like furniture and economic indicators that seem too good to be true. Denmark has one of the lowest poverty rates in the world and lowest income disparities. At one point the jobs picture was so good unemployment dropped below 2 percent, something some economists would tell you should be impossible.
