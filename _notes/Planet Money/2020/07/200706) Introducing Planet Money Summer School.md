Introducing an economics education for your ears! We're calling it Planet Money Summer School. It's all the economics you meant to learn, but didn't get around to. Each Wednesday, we'll serve up a Planet Money story, or selection of excerpts, paired with insights from our economists-in-residence for the summer. Get an understanding of the basic concepts of economics going to the beach. You can pick up your economics knowledge while you bike, stroll the sand or just lay in the grass. Amuse your friends. Win arguments. Throw the words "diminishing marginal utility" into every discussion. Wednesdays in the PM feed this summer. (Fridays will be our usual coverage of the economy). Start listening to the episodes here.

ROBERT SMITH, HOST:

Hey, everyone. Robert Smith here. At PLANET MONEY, we cover the world of economics. But honestly, most of us at the show have never studied the subject. I personally keep a giant textbook right next to me on my desk for when I need to look up the difference between monopoly and monopsony. It's a real problem. So this July and August, we're trying something new. We are all going back to class. It's called PLANET MONEY Summer School, which, now that I hear it, doesn't sound as fun as it's going to be. So let's do this promo-style.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SMITH: Oh, yeah. Here we go. Beach party.

PLANET MONEY Summer School - all of the economics you meant to learn but didn't get around to. We will have eight audio classes, one released every Wednesday, featuring our favorite PLANET MONEY stories and lessons from some of the world's greatest and most charming economists.

UNIDENTIFIED ECONOMIST: Economics is not about money. It's a blend (ph) of great power and beauty.

SMITH: And once you get the fundamental concepts, you will start to see them everywhere.

(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)

SMITH: The news...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

JACOB GOLDSTEIN: A small asteroid had entered the Earth's atmosphere

SMITH: ...At the supermarket...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

RICKY ROSS: Nobody wanted to go buy baking soda because they felt like when they go in there and buy the whole shelf of baking soda that everybody knew what they was doing.

SMITH: ...And even the economics of your dating life.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

CHANA JOFFE-WALT: Each time, she went home after the date, and she would record one memorable detail.

LISA CHOW: Pothead, touchy, boring. This guy had four gym memberships.

SMITH: Amuse your friends, win arguments, throw the words diminishing marginal utility into every discussion. And if you do some homework and pass the test at the end, we'll even put your name on a PLANET MONEY diploma-like certificate. PLANET MONEY Summer School - new episodes every Wednesday this summer. And then on Fridays, just like always, we'll release a brand-new episode on the economic crisis that we're living through right now.
