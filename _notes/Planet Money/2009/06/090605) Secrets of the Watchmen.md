We're launching our fourth special on This American Life this weekend. The show covers the people and agencies who were supposed to be watching out for the economy, and why all that watching failed to stave off the financial crisis. Chana Joffe-Walt and David Kestenbaum reveal two fascinating bits you won't hear anywhere else. The first concerns Darrel Dochow, a regulator whose tenure stretched from a bank at the heart of the Keating Five scandal to the collapse of IndyMac. The second is about Mabel Yu, a bonds analyst who warned her company to stop buying mortgage-backed securities. Plus, an interview with Jon Swan, one of the Harvard students behind the MBA Oath, and a farewell to our fabulous editor Jonathan Kern, who's retiring. He has some advice for you.
