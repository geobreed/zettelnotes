Nuhu Ribadu spent years fighting corruption in Nigeria. From his early days in the Nigerian police force to his later years as Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ribadu battled the corruption that strangled his country's economic growth. He had some success for a while, but after two attempts on his life, he was forced to leave his home country and come to the United States. He shares the stories of his struggle and says he hasn't given up yet.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

Hey, Caitlin, can you play the music and the tape that goes at the start of the show?

CAITLIN KENNEY, BYLINE: No.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

What do you mean, no?

KENNEY: No. I just can't do it. Sorry.

KESTENBAUM: What do you mean?

KENNEY: I have other things going on - I mean, unless you want to sweeten the pot somehow.

KESTENBAUM: Alex, can you give her 20 bucks?

BLUMBERG: I'm not going to give her 20 bucks. She's bribing us.

KESTENBAUM: Just do it, man. It's going to take forever, otherwise.

BLUMBERG: All right. Fine. Here you go.

KENNEY: All right. Now you can have it.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter).

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LYNN REASER: We have been losing jobs on the order of about 200,000 per month in the last couple of months. We think a year from now, companies will be adding about 200,000 jobs per month.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "STARING AT THE SUN")

TV ON THE RADIO: (Singing) Cross the street from your storefront cemetery. Hear me hailing from inside. And realize I'm...

KESTENBAUM: Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum. Today's November 23. That is my anniversary, my wife and I.

BLUMBERG: Oh, that is great. I'm Alex Blumberg, and I'd like to dedicate this podcast to you and your wife.

KESTENBAUM: (Laughter) Thank you.

BLUMBERG: That was Lynn Reaser you heard at the top, president of the National Association for Business Economics, NABE. And she was saying that economists her group represents are optimistic about the job market turning around. And let's hope they're right.

KESTENBAUM: Today on the podcast, Alex, I have found the solution to public radio's problems. I have found a way to fund this great organization. So we will not need to beg our listeners anymore. And the answer came to me in this email. Here, I'm going to read it to you. It says, attention, sir.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. You have been recommended by a reliable source that assured me in confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction involving a large sum of money. Alex, this is from the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation. And if I help them, they're going to wire me $135 million.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) I think I've seen that email.

KESTENBAUM: It was sent to me.

BLUMBERG: If you haven't picked up on our subtle clues, today on the podcast, we're going to be talking about scams, corruption - in particular in Nigeria. I imagine a lot of you out there have seen that email, the one from somebody from Nigeria, either a Nigerian banker or a Nigerian prince, assuring you riches if you just do this one favor. But how many of us actually know what's on the other side of that email? It's very surprising, and we'll hear all about it later on the podcast. But first, our PLANET MONEY Indicator. It is 10.1%.

KESTENBAUM: And that is the increase in the number of homes sold in October compared to the previous month. Now, analysts were expecting a jump, but this was even jumpier than the analysts expected. I was reading Bloomberg News. And you know how they survey analysts, and they publish a range of estimates?

BLUMBERG: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: There's always one analyst who's, like, crazy optimistic.

BLUMBERG: Right. Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: This was actually higher than the crazy optimistic projection.

BLUMBERG: Right. And the stock market shot up more than 8% after the news hit. The new numbers come from the National Association of Realtors. An economist there said people were rushing to buy houses before the first-time homebuyer tax credit expires, although that tax credit was just extended. But this was before people knew it was going to be extended - also because interest rates were very low. Still, it's seen as a positive sign for the housing market, the very thing that dragged us down this hole in the first place.

KESTENBAUM: Now, the United States - you can say what you will about our role in the financial crisis. One thing we can be proud of is that we do not have a corruption problem here. One of the reasons I think our...

BLUMBERG: Caitlin notwithstanding.

KESTENBAUM: Not a big problem.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) OK, right.

KESTENBAUM: One of the reasons our country, you know, is one of the most productive and successful economies on the planet is that anyone who wants to start a business here or come to live here, they know what the rules are. You don't have to bribe lots of officials to get a building permit. You don't compete for a government contract and then find the guy in charge gives the job to his cousin instead. You know, we don't have a big corruption problem.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. Actually, I looked at the International Corruption index, which you can find online, and it ranks countries by how corrupt they are perceived to be. And the U.S. is not at the top of that list. It's the 19th-least-corrupt country in the world.

KESTENBAUM: And actually, you know, we think the bottom of the list is much more interesting. And today, we are going to go way down the list to Nigeria because corruption is the sort of thing that can really hold a country back economically, and it can be incredibly, incredibly difficult to get rid of. So, Alex, you and I talked with one man who tried to help rid his country of it, Nuhu Ribadu. He was the chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission in Nigeria from 2003 to 2007.

BLUMBERG: Nuhu has been fighting crime in Nigeria for several decades. He started as a police officer in 1985, and then he became a prosecutor, before he eventually went to head this commission in 2003. And he had some success fighting corruption in Nigeria, for a while anyway. We asked him to tell the whole story, and he started by giving us just a sense of how pervasive corruption was in Nigeria when he took over the commission in 2003.

NUHU RIBADU: If you go there, the life - the way people live, the way we govern ourselves, the way we manage ourselves is almost all controlled by corruption literally taking over the entire engine of the society. And, of course, it affected our growth, our development and our inability to solve our own problems. That was the state of things. And...

BLUMBERG: Now, when you say it literally took over our lives, what does that mean? How does it feel? Like, if I'm a shopkeeper, say, in Lagos or...

RIBADU: It simply means, whatever you are going to do, chances are you are going to be confronted with bribery and corruption. Someone's out there, wherever you are - any point of contact - someone is trying to take something from you. Someone is taking advantage of his own position, whether it is in public office or in power or an authority person or even a taxi driver or motorbike operator or probably a schoolteacher or even a health attendant, wherever. Chances are somebody is going to - for whatever service, you are likely going to pay extra than what is normal and ordinary.

BLUMBERG: So how did this commission, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, how did it start? You were - so...

RIBADU: Well, first of all, the EFCC - the establishment of EFCC itself came as a result of pressure from outside, from the international community. And there is a small body of the G-7 called FATF, Financial Action Task Force, that was mandated to, you know, oversee the enforcement of anti-money-laundering law across the world. And they suddenly became strong and alert and - to their responsibilities after the September 11, when the world realized that you needed to control money laundering for you to be able to fight terrorism and other criminal activities.

So countries like Nigeria were picked out to improve their own money laundering regime, and if - failure to do so will, of course, mean they are going to be penalized. So we were blacklisted, which means we are - took completely out of the financial sector of the world. You could not do - transact business with the rest of the world. So we were forced to come up with a new anti-money-laundering regime and then also set up a commission, an agency, to enforce that law. And also, I got to be the pioneer chairman to establish it. And then I ran it for about four or five years.

BLUMBERG: So - OK. So just describe - how do you go about doing that? That's a pretty tall order, right? You went after...

RIBADU: We went after...

BLUMBERG: ...Scammers, for one, right?

RIBADU: I went after the fraudsters. The scammers, they were easy target because they were not the public guys. And then the people...

BLUMBERG: The fraudsters - you mean...

RIBADU: The fraudsters.

BLUMBERG: ...People who send, like, the email...

RIBADU: The scammers.

BLUMBERG: ...Scams? Right. Yeah.

RIBADU: Yeah, those guys that sent these very embarrassing letters from Nigeria across the world and then...

BLUMBERG: Saying I'm a Nigerian prince and if you - I have this money. Yeah.

RIBADU: That's - yeah. Very, very ingenious, very horribly bad guys who made a mess of our own image, and they got away with it for a long period. So they are the guys that I first went after, and I literally picked almost all the known ones. And before then, they were literally like celebrities. They were the big guys in the society. They were the ones who were sponsoring people into public office. They were the ones with convoys, with big cars, and then would occupy front seats in ceremonial things and social events and so on. So I went after them. I brought them...

BLUMBERG: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're saying that the people who, in America, we know, basically, as the people who send these email scams saying I'm a Nigerian banker, or I'm a Nigerian nobleman or whatever, those people, in Nigeria, they were, like, living the lives of, like, gangsters and things?

RIBADU: Very much. Very much.

BLUMBERG: They had big - lots of money and were rolling like that? Wow.

RIBADU: Very, very - because they made so much money. It's amazing if you know how much money those guys got. They were pretty much successful. And...

BLUMBERG: How much did they get?

RIBADU: Well, I mean, within a short period of time, we were able to recover as much as about $750 million.

BLUMBERG: Seven hundred and fifty million dollars.

RIBADU: Seven hundred and fifty million dollars. And that is not small.

KESTENBAUM: All taken from people across the world, ordinary people.

BLUMBERG: All taken from elderly - all over the world, it was happening.

(LAUGHTER)

RIBADU: All over the world - I think they took the most from, amazingly, I mean, surprisingly, from the Latin America.

BLUMBERG: Oh, really?

RIBADU: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Wow. So...

RIBADU: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So you recovered $750 million from these guys and put them behind bars.

RIBADU: Yes, I did. We got them, yes. And we recovered substantially. Of course, it's not possible to take everything. They must have spent and wasted so much part of it. But we got fairly big, and then we identified the individuals - I mean, the victims, and we traced them across the world. Some of them, of course, were already in contact, and we returned whatever we could get. And, of course, internally as well, there are people who are also duped and cheated and so on. So we do - we have returned most of that. And then we got them through the justice process, got them convictions. They served jail terms. I believe a lot of them are still in prison. Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: Nuhu, I read...

RIBADU: Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: ...That there was this email scam that was done in your name saying, basically...

RIBADU: Oh, several.

KESTENBAUM: ...Hi, I run the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. We have some money to return to you - that someone tried to use you for a new scam.

RIBADU: Oh, a lot, a lot. You know, they were just picking any name that was making, like, noise and making waves around and across. And my name was certainly that at one point. And so - and they knew that the work I was doing involved also recovery of money. So it could easily be a good name to use. But we got several of them convicted using my name. Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: You got some of those guys?

RIBADU: Yes. We have got several Nuhu Ribadus convicted.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Now, when you're going after somebody who - you said that these guys who were running these scams, they were pretty big-deal guys. They had lots of money they were flashing around town, you know, and...

RIBADU: Yes. That is sad part. When you have a breakdown of society and values and morals, you know, everything just turned upside down. And then those who - the bad people will turn out to be the ones who are more or less celebrated. And I think it is not too different - for example, the gangsters in those days in the U.S.

BLUMBERG: Right.

RIBADU: And from nowhere, they will make so much money and use the money to almost take over everything - bribe the law enforcement, bribe the judiciary, become friends with the people in authorities, own clubs and then, you know, run sometimes even legitimate business and so on. They are just like that. And they became very normal in a society that was very tolerant for everything that was - that behavior.

BLUMBERG: Was it actually easier to do law enforcement in this environment because the criminals were so used to nobody actually pursuing them that they were a little bit more brazen than they would have been otherwise? I mean...

RIBADU: To some extent, yes, because it would make - I mean, it would not be too difficult in terms of getting evidence. They didn't have to bother about sophistication or hiding or making it really difficult, no. At the initial stage, no. But it also - the most dangerous place to be in law enforcement because for money you can get things done, anything - including, of course, knocking anybody. And if someone refused to be a corrupt person, there will always be another way to take care of him underhandedly (ph).

BLUMBERG: So, OK - so after - so you start with the scammers, and that's sort of a strategic move on your part just to sort of build momentum - right? - for the crime fighting. Yeah.

RIBADU: That's - yeah. It was a soft target. It was a good way to introduce myself. It was a way to also win support because the public were not in support of that. And it was also something that could easily make us known across the world - that there's something new, fresh taking place in Nigeria. It was a good way to start.

BLUMBERG: And then where did you go from there? Then you started going after people within the government and business...

RIBADU: Yeah. And then gradually, I built, like, a lot of steps, and I was going step by step. I - from that point, of course, I went after businessmen who are compromising the whole system - smugglers, I mean, for example, those who do not pay taxes and so on. And I graduated to going after banks' executives, chiefs of banks who are taking depositors' money and then destroying the entire private sector. And then from there, I started going after government institutions and agencies that are critical to the economy. And then I finally graduated to the big guys. That was the politicians and then the powerful-powerful. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So tell me about James Ibori.

RIBADU: James is one of the jobs that we got eventually towards the end because he was a governor, a governor of one of the Niger Delta states. He was a governor for about eight years. And he was one of those really exceptional in terms of the corruption problem. He was living larger than life, and he was converting or diverting most of the money going to the state. And it's a very rich state. It's a state in the Niger Delta that got so much money within a short period of time, but most of it ended up in his own private pocket.

So we brought him to justice. But he was a very powerful guy. And in the course of bringing him to justice, it was a very, very difficult thing. He tried everything you can imagine to stop that. Indeed, of course, involved - I mean, to the point of giving me money. He give me $15 million cash in $100 bills to stop the investigation. I used the money - took it from him, used it as evidence, charged him in court and then put the money in the Central Bank of Nigeria.

KESTENBAUM: Will you describe how that happened, how he offered you the money and then how you got it?

RIBADU: So he gave me - he call me. He said that this money is available for me. I said, what for? Basically, he said, it's for you. Whatever it takes for us to solve this problem, we have to just solve it. So I called my own staff - about, I suppose, four of them, three or four of them - to come over and then pretended to be just, like, my own assistants or private individuals who are close...

KESTENBAUM: Your personnel. Yeah.

RIBADU: ...To me, personal people. And then they took the money right in front of him. And then as they took it, they just went straight to Central Bank of Nigeria, got the money counted and then deposited it and then took a receipt, and we have the receipt with us. And, of course, after that I even tried to get James to come over. OK, James, let's talk about this thing. We have taken the money. What next do we do? You know, you cannot just take money without having some explanations. He refused, until when we had to forcefully take him in and then charge him to court.

BLUMBERG: And so - and then what happened? Was he - he was convicted?

RIBADU: He was charged to court. But sadly, few days after that, I was asked to vacate the office. And that was the beginning of the troubles that I have had.

BLUMBERG: Right.

RIBADU: And he is extremely a very powerful guy, even now, in the country. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So - go ahead.

KESTENBAUM: I read that there were two assassination attempts on you.

RIBADU: Yes. Yeah. One was in September 2008, and then the one last - just about this period, this Christmas period, in Abuja. And that was the night I left Abuja. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Right, right. I'm just curious - one of the things that we want to talk about is just the economic impact of corruption on Nigeria. And maybe let me ask the question this way. For those 4 1/2 years when corruption was on the run, when it was harder for Nigerians to launder money abroad, when it was harder for corrupt people to launder money abroad, was there an impact on the economy and on the financial system that you can measure?

RIBADU: Amazing. Amazing.

BLUMBERG: Really?

RIBADU: It's incredible.

BLUMBERG: Talk about that.

RIBADU: At the time when we started addressing this problem in 2003, the country had probably $7 billion or so in its own reserve. By 2007, we had over 60 billion in our own reserves.

BLUMBERG: So just to get that number straight, you said that you had - that before 2003, you had $7 billion in reserves - in your - Nigeria had $7 billion in its own reserves. After your efforts were underway, it had 60 billion. Is that what you said?

RIBADU: After - of course, we were able to wipe out the entire foreign debt, which was, at one point, about $34 billion. But not just that - the entire economy changed. We had a boom in our capital market. The banks changed. The money flow of capital - instead of outflow of capital, we started witnessing a huge inflow, especially with the pressure that was put on those Nigerians who are taking money and keeping it outside. They began to return the money, and they started returning that money and investing it into our own economy. And...

BLUMBERG: So if I'm a corrupt governor somewhere and I have - you know, I've taken $70 million in. Before 2003, I might have spent it on a villa in Paris and maybe my own Learjet.

RIBADU: That's it. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Instead, I have to keep it in the bank in Nigeria, basically.

RIBADU: That is it. And that is the sad part of what - I feel so angry with what is going on to our - in our country today. We had these wonderful things changing and coming our way, and then suddenly, it has been reversed to the point - even those guys who are being brought to justice in the U.K., the government goes out of its way to stop it and say, we are not interested. It is not your business to help us. Leave that money to go, and we don't want you to do anything. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: The Nigerian government has said that.

RIBADU: Yes, yes, yes.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, yeah.

KESTENBAUM: What lesson do you draw from this? Because on the one hand, you won for a while, but in the end, what happened is what seems to happen everywhere, is that someone makes a stab at it, and it gets crushed.

RIBADU: It's sad, but then it's not something that we give up. If you see problems that people are confronted with, people will just - some people will have to step forward and make a sacrifice and then just pray that you will make it. Otherwise, there will be no change. There will be no change. And I've already gotten into this. There is nothing I can do. That is defining my life again. I have no any other thing than to continue to do what I believe is the right thing for my own country and for my own people.

BLUMBERG: So, Dave, you talked to Nuhu a little bit after this conversation, and he talked to you about whether or not he's actually planning on going back any time soon, right?

KESTENBAUM: He said - yeah. He said he'd like to go back but not now. It is just too dangerous.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. I mean, it's one of those things when you think about - like, there's economic development, and then there's, you know, sort of fearing for your life.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah, he said, I like my life, is what he said.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Right.

KESTENBAUM: I like living.

BLUMBERG: Right, Right.

KESTENBAUM: I mean, my - you know, I just - it seems like it's such a hard thing to get rid of. You need to have, like, a functioning court system. You need to have, like, lawyers and judges and police who aren't corrupt and just, you know, contract law and, you know, an open and transparent government. It seems like the hardest thing to tackle. And yet, unless you can really work on it, it's going to be very hard to get other people to come invest in your country and build in your country. And, I don't know, just - it seems like one of the toughest, toughest things.

BLUMBERG: Right, right. I think that does it for us here today. We're going to be talking a lot more about corruption and economic development in Africa on future podcasts. Be sure to check out our blog, npr.org/money, where you can see what we have to say even when we aren't podcasting.

KESTENBAUM: And send us an email - planetmoney@npr.org. Let us know what you think. And, please, no Nigerian fraud schemes.

I'm David Kestenbaum.

BLUMBERG: And I'm Alex Blumberg. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "STARING AT THE SUN")

TV ON THE RADIO: (Singing) Note the trees because the dirt is temporary - more to mine than fact, face, name and monetary. Beat the skins, and let the loose lips kiss you clean. Quietly pour out like light, like light, like answering. You're staring at the sun. You're standing in the sea. Your mouth is open wide. You're trying hard to breathe.
