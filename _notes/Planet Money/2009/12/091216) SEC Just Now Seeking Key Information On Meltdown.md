On today's Planet Money: In an ongoing investigation by ProPublica, a non-profit investigative newsroom, in collaboration with NPR's Planet Money, reporters found that almost three years since banks starting taking losses that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Securities and Exchange Commission is still asking basic questions about what happened. Planet Money's Adam Davidson and Chana Joffe-Walt and Propublica's Jake Bernstein and Jesse Eisinger talk about the story, published Wednesday on NPR.org.
