The announcement earlier this week, that Dubai World, a company owned by the government of Dubai, was hoping to delay payment on $26 billion in debt sent stock markets across the world plummeting. Analysts were watching to see if investors would pull out of banks and investment firms with exposure in the Middle East or flee risky markets altogether. By now, fears of Dubai's credit crisis spreading outside the country appear to have abated, but questions about Dubai remain, like, "what in the world were they thinking?" Dr. Christian Koch of the Gulf Research Center, says Dubai has a good economic strategy, but things got too crazy, too quickly. To Jane Meikle, a Canadian who has spent the last four years living in Dubai, sure the place went a little crazy, but that's part of what makes it so great. She talks about the upside of life in a gulf state boom town, where everyone is from somewhere else.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PIERS MORGAN: If you came to Dubai a few years ago, you'd have got this - sand and loads of it. Then an amazing thing happened. Fantasy became reality. And in the space of just 20 years, Dubai turned from desert into a jaw-dropping oasis of stone, marble, concrete, glass and more excitement.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "ISLAND IN THE SUN")

WEEZER: (Singing) Hip-hip (ph) hip-hip. When you're on a holiday, you can't find the words to say all the things that come to you, and I want to feel it, too. On an island in the sun...

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg.

DAVID KESTENBAUM, HOST:

And I'm David Kestenbaum. Today is Wednesday, December 2. And that was British TV presenter Piers Morgan you heard at the top of the podcast on a television travel show about the subject of today's podcast, Dubai.

BLUMBERG: And our PLANET MONEY Indicator, our patented PLANET MONEY indicator is also about Dubai. The number is 26 billion.

KESTENBAUM: And it's $26 billion. That is the amount of debt that Dubai World - that's a company which is owned by the government of Dubai - is seeking to restructure. And by restructure, we mean they're basically saying, we can't pay this back on time. We know that we owe it to you, but we've got to work something out.

BLUMBERG: Now, this surprise announcement that they needed to restructure - this sort of took the world by storm. And it was a huge story over the weekend. It really freaked out stock markets around the world. They were plummeting earlier this week before they regained most of their losses yesterday and today. And we here at PLANET MONEY have been looking into the issue of Dubai and Dubai World and why this was such a big deal.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. When I heard the story, I was like, do I need to be afraid of this? Somebody is afraid of this.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Right.

KESTENBAUM: But I don't understand it at all. So that's what this podcast today here is for. So here are some quick facts and figures. So Dubai is an emirate. It is one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, called the UAE. Dubai has its own government, its own finances. But these emirates - I was just looking on a map. They exist on a fairly small piece of land. I looked it up. It's exactly the same area as South Carolina.

BLUMBERG: If South Carolina were a loose confederation of seven sheikhdoms. And actually, Dubai is not the biggest or the wealthiest. That is Abu Dhabi. That is the biggest and the wealthiest of these Emirates. Dubai is the second biggest and richest. The remaining five are pretty small and not very wealthy. And Abu Dhabi is the one with by far the most oil. It has tons and tons of oil. Dubai just has a little bit of oil, which is why it has embarked on the strategy to try to diversify its economy.

KESTENBAUM: And this campaign really kicked into high gear when the current ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, took over as crown prince. That was in the mid-1990s. And basically, Dubai took its oil money and invested it in lots of other businesses - Emirates Airlines, Dubai Ports World, which manages ports all over the world. And, of course, Dubai invested in a lot of real estate.

BLUMBERG: And with the global downturn, a lot of these investments are looking not so great. It invested in casinos in Vegas, which now look to be in trouble. It invested in a company which hoped to build recreational submarines.

KESTENBAUM: I did not know that.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, that didn't work out so well. And it embarked on some pretty colossal mega developments in Dubai proper - the entity of Dubai - which also now seem to be pretty major mistakes.

KESTENBAUM: Are you referring to the indoor ski dome where a man can ski on a manmade mountain on manmade snow?

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) I am, in fact. And this is in a desert country that already had an indoor manmade ski hall, so it added another one. But I talked to a guy named Christian Koch. He's a Ph.D. researcher at something called the Gulf Research Center. And he said these investments were all part of a strategy and a pretty good strategy at that.

CHRISTIAN KOCH: Basic ideas behind some of these new projects and then tourism projects, as well, were quite sound, but it just got a little bit too crazy. And then people let some of these ideas go to their heads, and it went all too fast. And some of the projects were just too grand at the end of the day. You build the tallest tower in the world, and you already announce plans for tower - for several towers that are supposed to be even taller, up to 1 kilometer and beyond that. You build a ski slope in the mall in Dubai, and you make plans to build a ski dome, which is going to be 10 times the size. You plan a palm island that can be seen from - supposedly from the moon. And then you build two other - you plan two other palm islands that are even bigger than this. And, I mean, ultimately, that's the question of, how much can you sustain all this construction and development? And what does it mean, actually, to keep it going?

BLUMBERG: Right.

KOCH: So I think in that sense, it just got a little bit out of sync.

KESTENBAUM: So this is where we stood last - before last week. Basically, the people who built - borrowed money to build all this stuff were now saying, we can't pay it all back right now. And there was concern around the world that this could cause a chain reaction. Then everyone sort of calmed down when Abu Dhabi signaled, listen. We're not going to let it get that bad. Abu Dhabi, remember, is sitting on top of over $800 billion because they have all the oil. And the amounts at risk here were less than a tenth of that.

BLUMBERG: But all this hubbub did get us thinking here at PLANET MONEY. You know, what is up with Dubai? You know, it's sort of seen as this sort of cartoonish now - this land of excess in the desert. And, you know, I know a couple of things about it. I know that it's very new. It's very rich. There are people who come there to work from all over the world and that these expatriates far outnumber the locals, actually. And I just have this sense of sort of a big corporate hotel where people come and go, but nobody really lives there. It's basically this soulless place. It's like living in Disneyland or something. But, Dave, I actually talked to someone who lives there, and she changed my mind. Jane Meikle is her name. And one of the first things that changed my mind was that she actually couldn't speak when we had originally planned on it because she had this conflict, a conflict which I found very surprising.

JANE MEIKLE: I had to go to my soccer game. They have this women's league here. There's people from all over, and they just get together a couple of times a week and play. It gets pretty competitive, but we're in the less competitive level.

BLUMBERG: Not only is there a women's soccer league in Dubai, but there's several levels of a women's soccer league...

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...In Dubai.

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: And so who's on your team? How many different nationalities are on your team?

MEIKLE: Probably as a guess, I'd say eight.

BLUMBERG: Uh-huh.

MEIKLE: At least. There's, like, Armenians and Russian Armenians and Palestinians who grew up here and Germans and South Africans and Canadians and an Austrian American girl who was born in Mexico. And in the league in general, I mean, there's Africans, tons - and I guess Arabs from all over the Arab world. There's local Emirati girls, and it's a really mixed bag.

BLUMBERG: So Dave, Jane moved to Dubai several years ago, and she worked there first in PR. Now she's in film. There's actually a big film festival in Dubai, and she's a filmmaker. And she said that there actually is this really interesting and complex society made up of people coming from all over the world.

MEIKLE: And several different layers of Dubai society so you can kind of make it what you want it to be, much like any other place but I think even more so because there are different extremes of lifestyle. Like there are people who are very religious and sort of hang out with their religious group and, you know, have - I don't know - fundraising activities for their mosque or their church. And then there's people who just want to party all the time, and they go out to all the clubs and, you know, meet a different person every night. And you end up partying with them after the club closes in some house that they've - they own just for that purpose. And the only thing in there is a DJ stand. And then you go into the kitchen, and they've bought all these McDonald's burgers. And you just see beautiful women stuffing their faces with cold McDonald's burgers and then partying with this guy. Like, it's just really surreal (laughter).

BLUMBERG: It sounds like...

MEIKLE: It kind of...

BLUMBERG: Wait a minute. (Laughter) It sounds like - is that what happened to you last night?

MEIKLE: (Laughter) No. It did happen to me once, though. I got dragged to a place by a friend. But it's - I mean, there are so many different possibilities.

BLUMBERG: So when you first got there, were you planning on staying, or did you know?

MEIKLE: No. I mean, I thought I'd be here for a year. And then now it's been almost four. For the time being, I'm still learning a lot, and I still like it.

BLUMBERG: And what do you like about it?

MEIKLE: It's so heterogenous, and it's so complex in so many ways. You've got all these different combinations of people, and they all have to deal with each other, which results in some extremely interesting situations. And also because there's no real accepted, like, civic norms of behavior, you sort of - everyone just behaves the way they behave more or less at home. So everyone has - you know, everyone's going to have their idea of what constitutes personal space. Everyone's going to have an idea of what constitutes, like, an appropriate volume of voice when you're talking to someone...

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

MEIKLE: ...Or, you know, appropriate wording of emails or punctuality or, you know, all of those things that make up professional life. Everyone will have a slightly different take on it. So in work situations, it's - it can be really fascinating. And then socially, obviously, there's, like, so many different possibilities that abound.

BLUMBERG: So just talk more about that. You know, and how - so you've got all these - like for example, at your workplace, how does this whole thing play out, like, all these different nationalities working in the same place? I mean, can you describe some situations where that's been a factor where you see that operating?

MEIKLE: Yeah. I mean, pretty much every day, like, everyone kind of has their own theory on how to deal with people based on where they're from.

BLUMBERG: Like, what are those theories, for example? Like what do...

MEIKLE: Oh, my God. There's so many. I mean, let's say at the PR agency, if a client is upset. And if I went to talk to my boss about a client being upset, the first question he would ask me is, where is that person from? And then the approach would be totally different depending on the answer. So it's sort of like a navigational kind of stereotype or some sort of productive generalization that he finds the best - like, he finds the best approach based on how he feels that someone's going to receive it.

BLUMBERG: And it - was it in a situation where, like, you'd have a meeting, and then you could sort of tell by the order in which people would show up at the meeting by which nationality was...

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Oh, really?

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So who's...

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...First? Who's last?

MEIKLE: (Laughter) I don't want to say it.

BLUMBERG: Oh, come on.

MEIKLE: I probably...

BLUMBERG: This is also, by the way, very Canadian of you. My wife is Iranian, and I've definitely noticed that, like, in her family, there's - it's like there's no stigma against stereotyping or pigeonholing, like, even down to, like, personal, like the - you know, it's very, you know, like, oh, that - you're the ugly one. You're the smart one in the family. You know, they'll say it to each other.

MEIKLE: (Laughter) Yeah.

BLUMBERG: You know what I mean?

MEIKLE: Or you've gained a lot of weight.

(LAUGHTER)

BLUMBERG: Yes, exactly. And that's - and it seems like it's a pretty - I mean, you know, I feel like you were being more reticent about this than, say, if I was talking to somebody else, you know, somebody maybe from a Middle Eastern background. They would be like, oh, yes. Clearly, like this is - you know, these people are - behave this way. And these people behave this way, and everybody knows it.

MEIKLE: No...

BLUMBERG: Do you think that's true?

MEIKLE: But I mean, I know all of those things. Like the fascinating thing is that I've learned all these ideas that everybody else has about each other.

BLUMBERG: So what are...

MEIKLE: And then I can kind of...

BLUMBERG: ...Some of the...

MEIKLE: ...Take them with a grain of salt or not. Like...

BLUMBERG: But what are - like, what is the established - like give me those established - the footnotes - rules.

MEIKLE: OK. Well, there's so many. Like, who knew? Like in the Arab world, I mean, the Lebanese are sort of like the Francophile, very fashion-y. You know, the assumption is they might have - like, they might have loose morals.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) OK.

MEIKLE: You know, they're always - they spend more on clothes than they make in a year. You know, this is the idea.

BLUMBERG: So the Lebanese are...

MEIKLE: And they're really extravagant, and they love to party.

BLUMBERG: OK. So the Lebanese...

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: ...Are the libertine dandies.

MEIKLE: Exactly. And then everyone says everyone else is cheap.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

MEIKLE: So, like, the Jordanians are cheap. The Egyptians are cheap. You know, everyone's cheap. Lots of people are lazy. Like, everyone will be like, these Saudis are so lazy. They never work. You know, the Egyptians are lazy. The Lebanese are lazy. I mean, it's (laughter)...

BLUMBERG: So every - so the Lebanese...

MEIKLE: ...The list goes on and on.

BLUMBERG: ...Say the Saudis are lazy. And the Saudis say the Lebanese are lazy or something like that?

MEIKLE: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. Yeah.

MEIKLE: Yeah. Yeah.

BLUMBERG: It's funny. As you're saying this, like, I feel like there's - I can't decide whether - so here you are. You're in this - you got people from all over the world trying to get along. It sounds like what you do is you sort of shorthand stereotype everybody. So I'm wondering if it makes you actually more likely to stereotype or less likely to stereotype.

MEIKLE: I think that it makes - I think it makes people here a little bit less likely to stereotype because they meet so many people from different places. Like, you might be making some assumptions as a way to prepare yourself to meet someone, but then, obviously, their personality is going to make a big difference too.

BLUMBERG: Right.

MEIKLE: But sometimes, I've spoken with this about people in Canada, and they're kind of, like, offended. Or they find it a bit of a dangerous concept. And I think when I first came here, I did, too.

BLUMBERG: Right.

MEIKLE: But I just think it's more of a practical look at what people actually do in their day-to-day lives.

BLUMBERG: Right.

MEIKLE: And again, you're not always right, you know? But it sort of acknowledges that the person isn't the same as you. And why should they be? Like, they're not from your background at all.

BLUMBERG: And it's not just the people, she says. Like, the entire city itself is in this constant state of change.

MEIKLE: This place itself - even last night when I was in a taxi, and I was going somewhere I hadn't gone in a little while, and the road was totally different, and my directions were wrong. And it happens all the time because things - everything is in flux.

BLUMBERG: Really? So, like, even a neighborhood that you were at - that you went to like a year ago - you go back and it's - everything's different.

MEIKLE: It'll be different. Like, the landmarks will have changed. The streets will have changed. Yeah. It'll be really different. It might be hard to find my way around.

BLUMBERG: And that's what I wanted to ask you. You know, there's a sense in some of the press reports that you get here now that, like, Dubai flew too close to the sun. And now it's crashing back down to Earth. It - does that - is that how it feels there on the ground?

MEIKLE: Not particularly. I mean, there's still stuff happening. There's still - and it might be a bit subdued. It won't be like a launch a week of some crazy, you know, exciting mega-project or some, like - you know, some entrepreneur is coming in and introducing this or that. Like, there won't be the same big-ticket things, but there's still stuff happening here. And there's still been so much invested and so many people's time and energy and money being - been put into some - to building something. Crashing down to the ground seems a bit extreme.

And I have to say that the schadenfreude that I have witnessed, especially in the British press over the last couple of weeks - well, definitely over the last year - but definitely over the last couple of weeks is just kind of laughable. It's like, have you never seen economic cycles? Like, I would say the same thing during the boom. Like, to read the British press, it was like Dubai was going to go on sailing forever the same way it was. And then now it's like, Dubai has failed. It's - you know, it's mired in debt. It's - you know, it's all going downhill from here. And yet these are the same journalists who came over on business class and, like, went home with all kinds of swag (ph) and wrote glowing articles about how great it all was. Everyone was participating in it, and everyone still is participating in it. And if anyone - you know, I don't think anyone should feel morally superior. And I think a lot of the moral superiority and the supercilious attitude that people have towards, you know, these crazy desert Arabs are taking all their money and buying shiny things. And, you know, all of that was really just, I think, envy.

KESTENBAUM: You know what, Alex?

BLUMBERG: Yeah?

KESTENBAUM: You know what I'm hearing there? I'm hearing national pride...

BLUMBERG: (Laughter).

KESTENBAUM: ...For a country that's not her nation...

BLUMBERG: Exactly.

KESTENBAUM: ...And that used to be desert.

BLUMBERG: Exactly. Exactly. And we talked about that - that they're - actually, out of this sort of, you know, lack of a common culture, a common culture is sort of evolving. She was feeling Dubai pride there for sure.

KESTENBAUM: That's what I think would happen if we, you know, eventually build a huge spaceship and put seven people from every country on it. It'd sort of be like that. The place looks like a spaceship anyway.

BLUMBERG: (Laughter) Yeah. It is sort of. Yeah.

KESTENBAUM: They just need to put some engines on the bottom of it, and we're good to go.

BLUMBERG: I'm sure some entrepreneur is planning that right now.

(LAUGHTER)

KESTENBAUM: There probably is a plan somewhere.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. And now, you know, Jane obviously is not an economist. But I did talk to a number of economists and also read a lot of press reports about this. And her basic takeaway is the same as what I've been hearing from other people, which is that, yes, there's - you know, they overbuilt. They're not going to be able to pay back all their debts, but the amount of debt that they're going to default on is insignificant compared to the wealth of the UAE in general. And that fears of it crashing down entirely to the ground or, like, causing a global contagion seem at the moment to be overblown.

KESTENBAUM: Yeah. What was the total debt they had to restructure?

BLUMBERG: The total debt is $26 billion.

KESTENBAUM: See - that doesn't even seem big to me anymore.

BLUMBERG: I know. I know.

KESTENBAUM: All right then. I think that does it for us here today at PLANET MONEY. Check out the blog, npr.org/money, where I've posted a post-climate game analysis looking at how Mike Pesca nearly destroyed the planet in our attempt to combat climate change on the last podcast. That's - there's a spreadsheet there if you (laughter) really want to get into it.

BLUMBERG: And of course, we always love to hear from you. If you're living in Dubai or you have a take on Dubai that is the same or, even better, different than the one we just heard, please let us know if you have a spreadsheet to send us. Send it all to us here at planetmoney@npr.org. Again, that's planetmoney@npr.org. I'm Alex Blumberg.

KESTENBAUM: And I'm David Kestenbaum. Thank you for listening.
