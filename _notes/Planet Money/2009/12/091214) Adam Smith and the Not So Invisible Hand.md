On today's Planet Money: Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg chat with Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics, about his new book, The Idea of Justice, and its critique of the theory of social justice. Sen spends time in his book, and on the podcast, talking about what he sees as common misinterpretations of Adam Smith's oft-cited but perhaps more complex embrace of an absolute free market.
