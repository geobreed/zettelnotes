AIG CEO Edward Liddy testified on Capitol Hill today. Congress wants Liddy to hold back $165 million in promised bonuses, but Liddy says he can't. The conflict is raising questions about who actually owns AIG. Meanwhile, the anger towards the insurance giant has been dominating the headlines this week, but not everyone is seeing red. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group says the government has much bigger fish to fry and that AIG outrage is a luxury we can't afford. Plus, who deserves more blame --Wall Street or Washington?

On today's Planet Money:

-- AIG CEO Edward Liddy testified on Capitol Hill today. Congress wants Liddy to hold back $165 million in promised bonuses, but Liddy says he can't. With the American taxpayers holding a nearly 80 percent stake in the company, some are asking — can't we just force him to do it? Chana Joffe-Walt gets a shareholder's perspective.

-- The anger towards AIG has been dominating the headlines this week, but not everyone is seeing red. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group says the government has much bigger fish to fry and that AIG outrage is a luxury we can't afford.

-- We've asked for your input on where to place the blame for the economic crisis. Jacob Ganz checks in on the debate over who deserves more — Wall Street or Washington.

Bonus: An indicator from New Mexico, after the jump.

    I passed dozens of sets of train cars just left on the tracks. There was no engine nor anything in the cars. I have never seen so many train cars sitting idle on the tracks with nothing to transport.
