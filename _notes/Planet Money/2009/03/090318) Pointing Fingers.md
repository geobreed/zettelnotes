AIG CEO Edward Liddy testified on Capitol Hill today. Congress wants Liddy to hold back $165 million in promised bonuses, but Liddy says he can't. The conflict is raising questions about who actually owns AIG. Meanwhile, the anger towards the insurance giant has been dominating the headlines this week, but not everyone is seeing red. Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group says the government has much bigger fish to fry and that AIG outrage is a luxury we can't afford. Plus, who deserves more blame --Wall Street or Washington?
