U.S. unemployment hit 8.1 percent in February — unless you count the underemployed, too, in which case it's 14.8. Economist Howard Rosen of the Peterson Institute for International Economics takes your questions about the real picture, COBRA, and which industries might be hit next. Plus: Ken Rogoff of Harvard says the economy's not so bad, if you look back over eight centuries or so. And Planet Money editor Jonathan Kern reads his "Villanelle for Uncertain Times."

LAURA CONAWAY, HOST:

The first question comes from Russell Jelks (ph). A month or two ago, unemployment was predicted to peak at about 10%. Is this prediction still valid?

HOWARD ROSEN: I personally never went as far as 10%. I certainly suggest it within the 8 to 9% realm. You know, I'll tell you, all of this depends on what happens in the financial markets. The stimulus package is really trying to address the real economy, what's happening in terms of, you know, people consuming and things like that. But the big variable out there that we do not know is what's going to happen to credit if we're - you know, so far, we're containing this, and we're trying to, you know, to deal with it. But if this were to move into the, let's say, the personal credit - the credit card industry and things like that, that could have further implications on the economy. So to the extent that we contain this and deal with it and the banks start, you know, relending and things like that, the economy will turn around. And as soon as it does that, with a lag, the labor market will start turning around. And so I think it's fair to say that - I may be wrong, but I don't think the unemployment rate will reach as high as 10%. But again, I want to say the rate is only one indicator. And what we've been seeing is that you may not get as many people unemployed, but if you are unlucky to be unemployed, the cost of that unemployment is much greater.

CONAWAY: This is from Megan E. (ph). She writes, if you're offered a buyout package, and 3/31 is your last day, will your job be counted as a slashed job in April?

ROSEN: The unemployment numbers come from a survey that's done - it's actually done the second week of every month. So the answer to Megan's question is it will not - it will only show up in April. That's right. Even though she loses her job March 31 - but the thing is, when the survey comes in the second week in April and they ask, were you employed more than, you know, certain many of hours, 25 hours this week or something like that? That's what the question is. Unfortunately, she will answer no. And so she'll be counted as part of the April numbers. But, again...

CONAWAY: Now, we should say we don't know if Megan's actually losing her job. This is just - for all we know...

ROSEN: If unfortunate...

CONAWAY: Yeah, exactly.

ROSEN: Right. Exactly. But, again, I want to stress that these numbers are adjusted based on factors external to, you know, to the system - weather, if there's some kind of a holiday. You might have a holiday in a certain week which will affect - people taking vacation during the Easter period, as an example, because it comes in April. So those kinds of things will affect the - Christmastime is a big thing - you know, Christmas employment, people working temporarily.

CONAWAY: This is Andy Van Derkolk (ph). What about people who are not technically unemployed? I just graduated and am not eligible for unemployment benefits.

ROSEN: Right. Right. That's exactly right. And, again, I mean, I want to go to the end first, which is, the point is, does our system - does our safety - social safety net, does it deal with these new realities? Should we be providing assistance to workers who have not worked but are entering the labor market and looking for jobs? He's unemployed. So he's in as much need as someone who has been employed for 20 years and isn't working, but yet we don't provide him any assistance. And not only that, but we - I mean, they do have assistance in terms of employment search assistance and things like that. They can go and look, you know, what kinds of jobs are available. But it is very difficult. And I would also add to the Twitter that, unfortunately, he's coming into the labor market at a very bad time.

CONAWAY: Yeah. Tell him the news, right?

ROSEN: Exactly. So that's another question, which is, should he get some assistance? Because, unfortunately, you know, he went to college at a certain time, and he's coming out now. Should he get some assistance that someone who came out of college in the 1990s didn't need? So these are all kinds of question - and I'm not suggesting that we should be this kind of - you know, handing out welfare checks to everyone. I'm not suggesting that at all. We can tailor that assistance to meet the needs of those individuals. But let me just say that in other countries - again, I'm not suggesting it in the United States, but in other industrialized countries, they do provide limited assistance to people coming out of college until they find jobs. They do it.

CONAWAY: An example would be...

ROSEN: Germany, a lot of European countries. I mean, it's not out of the question there. Sweden, Denmark - it's not out of the question. They understand that that person is just as unemployed as someone who had been working previously.

CONAWAY: All right. Wonderland Cat - if I get an internship that pays a stipend, say, a thousand dollars a month, how will that affect my unemployment? Will I be eligible?

ROSEN: We count - well, first of all, in order to get unemployment, you have to have been working full-time.

CONAWAY: Internship doesn't count?

ROSEN: Now - the internship won't - right. Now, let me just qualify that because you've got some very sophisticated people writing in. In the stimulus bill, the federal government is now providing a pool of money, $7 billion, to the states to encourage them to cover part-time and temporary workers. Now, the states - it's voluntary. The states don't have to do it. But the government is - the federal government is trying to encourage states to do more of that. And it's possible - I mean, it depends on how these things are all structured. It's possible that her internship could be considered a part-time or temporary employment. And therefore, in a state that has done these changes, then she would be eligible for unemployment insurance. If she continues to receive outside income during her, quote, "unemployment," i.e., this internship, that money gets deducted from the amount of money she gets on a weekly basis.

CONAWAY: Let's do some - I'm sorry. You're still going.

ROSEN: No, I just - and I want to say one other thing because I just - because it's - I think it's really interesting, and I want to put it out here right now. We have heard from several governors that they are reluctant or do not want to take stimulus money. I want to - it should be made very clear, because I don't think it's been examined carefully, these governors are not suggesting that they're not going to take the billions of dollars for infrastructure spending or the money to help offset their budget deficits in their states. What they are saying is they're not going to take this $7 billion, and we're talking about a couple million per state, right?

So they're not going to take anything from this pool of money to provide unemployment insurance to their part-time and temporary workers because they fear that if they do that now, they will have to continue doing it, and, therefore, they will have to increase their payroll taxes in order to finance this in the future. So I want to make it very clear that these governors are not saying that they're not going to take, you know, the infrastructure money, the big cash - they're going to take that. What they're talking about is they're not going to take the government money to help unemployed workers.

CONAWAY: I have a couple of stimulus questions, actually.

ROSEN: Yeah. OK.

CONAWAY: One has to do with COBRA.

ROSEN: Yes.

CONAWAY: Sweet Sue writes, COBRA question - will the stimulus subsidize premiums for someone who resigned her job to move back home - to move back to her hometown because hours and pay was cut?

ROSEN: So what the Twitter did not tell us is if she's eligible for COBRA because she's asking two different questions. The first question is the stimulus package does provide a 65% subsidy if you are eligible for COBRA. Now let's define the terms. COBRA means that if you leave your job, if you lose your job, you can continue your health insurance for 16 - for 18 months, a year and a half - excuse me - 18 months at the same cost that it cost your previous employer, except that you will have to pay both sides, the employer part and the employee part.

But the important point is that you get it at a group rate, as opposed to if you lose your job, and you go try to find - I mean, health insurance, the rates are just, you know, gigantic. So you can continue at the same rate, the same cost, of your health insurance previously. But you have to pay both sides and only for 18 months. Under the stimulus bill, Congress has provided a 65% subsidy for that 18 months. She can get her COBRA if she changes jobs, and during that period, she doesn't have unemployment - doesn't have health insurance. And, in fact, if she takes another job that doesn't provide health insurance, she can continue the COBRA from the previous job.

CONAWAY: Nathan Proll (ph) wants to know, has there been any benefit to the self-employed worker thanks to the stimulus?

ROSEN: Unfortunately not. Let's see. In unemployment insurance, we don't provide any assistance to the self-employed. We should do it, but we don't. It would be a different system because, you know, you can't - you know, we don't know what the previous wage is, and you're not paying payroll taxes and all that kind of stuff. But we could come up with a scheme that could do that. We don't do that. On the health insurance - only if you are self-employed following full employment so that, let's say, you were employed. You had health insurance, and you left, and you started doing self-employed work for the next 18 months, and you were doing COBRA, then you would get assistance. But, again, it's spotty. If you didn't have health insurance, you don't get it. It's only for 18 months. That's a problem.

So I'm going through in my mind very quickly - I - off the top of my mind, I don't know. It does - well, the other would be the tax changes. That's where you would get - oh, I'm sorry. I should have said this at the outset, which is the - what I would call a payroll tax holiday. The - under the stimulus package, they are reducing the payroll tax for a finite period of time so people will have to pay - withhold less on a weekly basis. And that's going to help everyone. It's not specific to the self-employed, but it will also help the self-employed. And - but that's - on the other hand, you've been hearing that that is going to be rather small. It comes to, on average, something like 8 to $10 a week per person. People are starting to ask, well, how are you going to spend your $8?

CONAWAY: OK.

ROSEN: But, you know, over a half a year, that adds up.
