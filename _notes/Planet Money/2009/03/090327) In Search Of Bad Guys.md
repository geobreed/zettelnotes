The plan calls for creating a systemic risk regulator to manage "certain large, interconnected firms and markets." Adam Davidson lays out what that job might look like. To analyze the effectiveness of the other plan the Treasury Department announced this week, the one to get toxic assets off bank balance sheets, you need to decide whether you think the banks have a solvency crisis or a liquidity crisis?
