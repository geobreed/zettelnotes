After David Kestenbaum posted this chart from the IMF, we asked the Twitter crowd if they understood it.

IMF

They understood it, all right, but each in his or her own way.

@OnOneCondition: OH! I know, It's a jellyfish blowing little banking bubbles. What do I win?

@dmoneye: I get it. Scary & stupid.

@reneerico: Isn't the best system regulator a market that is transparent and where no participant holds market power?

@ananelson, part one: That graph is yet another illustration of how everyone conveniently forgot the "uncorrelated" part of diversification of risk.

@ananelson, part two: I do actually find it worrying that the IMF doesn't understand hyperlinks.

@MLeaverton that chart means that we're all screwed!

@DocPowers: that is what a dangerous oligopoly, unregulated markets and the myth of shared risk looks
like

@karlw00t looks like Bear Stearns and AIG had all the arrows going to them ...

@TbroOnline I understand it perfectly, it's a mushroom, actually It's a smurf house since it has a chimney

And finally, the challenge, from @bucknam:

    that IMF chart is ripe for re-visualization. A good challenge for idle hands in the design studio this morning!

It's all yours. We await the results.
