The planet's rich nations met this week to discuss, among other issues, ways to help the planet's poor nations. But those poor nations have their own group. It's called the anti-G20, in a nod to the G20 collection of industrialized states. The anti-G20 met at the U.N. last month, where Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Martin Khor explained what keeps impoverished countries down. Answer: Their debt to the IMF and wealthier nations. Plus: a second look at the surprisingly complex financial lives of the poor, with a focus on burial societies and very alternative banks.
