Goldman Sachs carries a certain mystique on Wall Street. The firm is known for hiring the brainiest people and paying them well. A number of its former executive have gone into politics, including former CEO Henry Paulson, who became President Bush's Treasury secretary, and former CEO Robert Rubin, an adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama. This week, Goldman finished paying back its $10 billion federal TARP loan — with taxpayers pocketing a return of 23 percent. The firm also just released a fantastic report on its earnings, totaling $23 billion for the first half of 2009. Goldman is setting aside almost half of that money for paying its 30,000 employees. In rough terms, that amounts to almost $400,000 for each worker. Lucas Van Praag, a Goldman spokesperson, answers questions about other ways Goldman received government help and why it's rewarding the staff so richly after getting a hand from Uncle Sam. Plus: The stunning results from our Economic Radio Story Showdown.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MATT TAIBBI: One of the things that's a recurring theme in this story is that Goldman, and banks like Goldman, they're expert at going after these big pools of investor capital. The big scam here is that they found ways to take a whole bunch of crap - right? - slap it with a triple-A rating, and sell it to a bunch of big institutional investors.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "RETURN OF THE MACK")

MARK MORRISON: (Singing) Oh, come on. Oh, yeah.

ALEX BLUMBERG, HOST:

Hello, and welcome to NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm Alex Blumberg in New York.

CHANA JOFFE-WALT, BYLINE: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt in Seattle. That was Matt Taibbi you heard at the top. He was talking about the subject of today's podcast, Goldman Sachs.

BLUMBERG: Yeah. And as you can hear, he's not particularly fond of Goldman Sachs. Matt Taibbi wrote an article about Goldman Sachs in a recent issue of Rolling Stone, basically accusing them of pretty much everything bad that happened in the last century. So - and we'll hear more from them and about them later on in the podcast.

And also, we're going to announce the results of the PLANET MONEY Iron Model Top Millionaire first-ever public radio story competition - a competition you were part of, right, Chana?

JOFFE-WALT: That's true.

BLUMBERG: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: I was.

BLUMBERG: We'll get to that in a minute. But first, the PLANET MONEY indicator.

JOFFE-WALT: It is 7.25. That is, effective today, the new minimum wage.

BLUMBERG: Seven dollars and 25 cents, up from 6.55, where it's been all last year. So for the half of American workers getting a salary instead of hourly wages, this doesn't apply to you. And for the roughly 95% of hourly workers making more than 7.25 an hour, this also doesn't apply to you. But if you're among the, I don't know, 5 million people - numbers differ - making under $7.25, good news. Today, you just got a raise.

JOFFE-WALT: Congratulations.

BLUMBERG: Yes.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Struggling a little bit with this transition here. OK. Let's move from minimum wage to maximum wage. We're going to talk about Goldman Sachs now.

BLUMBERG: Right. Goldman Sachs, where I don't think anybody works for minimum wage - far from it. Last week, they released their earnings statements for the second quarter of 2009, and the earnings were pretty fantastic.

JOFFE-WALT: If you look at an earnings statement, it's a bunch of lines with numbers, how much they made, how much they spent. And then there's this one line - compensation and benefits, which is basically all the money that the firm is setting aside to pay its employees. And this is for everything - salary, benefits and bonus.

BLUMBERG: And if you look at Goldman's earnings statement, they had net revenues, so far, for the first six months of this year, for $23 billion. And of that, they've set aside 11.5 billion - almost half, which is pretty standard for Wall Street - to pay their employees. Now, there are less than 30,000 people who work at Goldman Sachs. So 11 billion for 30,000 - that's almost 400 grand for every single employee of Goldman Sachs. That's the average payout. And the year is only half over. So presumably that $11 billion pot is just going to grow and grow for the rest of the year.

JOFFE-WALT: Man, they are on pace for a record year in compensation, beating 2006 when they paid about 16.5 billion - billion with a B - in compensation. And their CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, he took home $52 million.

So, Alex, when I say these words, it's weird because a year ago, we were all saying the words that Goldman Sachs and the rest of Wall Street - didn't they have to be saved from collapse? And now they're on pace for record salaries. Something seems a little weird about that.

BLUMBERG: Right. Well, Chana, I talked to someone who has a lot of thoughts about whether or not this is weird.

LUCAS VAN PRAAG: My name is Lucas van Praag, and I am the spokesman for Goldman Sachs.

BLUMBERG: He sure is. Yesterday, I went to Goldman Sachs and I talked to Mr. van Praag about this very issue and lots of other issues that people like Matt Taibbi have been writing about - issues which basically fall under the rubric, is Goldman Sachs destroying the world for its own profit, basically? And first of all, I never thought I'd actually get this interview because I'd heard that Goldman was sort of famously media-shy or even media-antagonistic. But when I called them up to ask for an interview, they seemed eager to talk, actually.

JOFFE-WALT: Yeah, which was sort of surprising because there is a lot of legend and mystery surrounding Goldman. They have this reputation as, like, the brainiest firm on Wall Street, that they hire the smartest people and they pay them the most money and they're doing the weirdest things. And then, you know, you add to that that a lot of their former executives are these big names in politics - Henry Paulson, President Bush's former treasury secretary, he was a CEO at Goldman Sachs; Robert Rubin, adviser to President Obama and, before that, President Clinton, he was a former chairman at Goldman; and Neel Kashkari, the guy who was put in charge of the $700 billion TARP program - Goldman Sachs. The list goes on and on.

BLUMBERG: And then you add to that Goldman employees gave almost a million dollars to President Obama's presidential campaign. Many former Goldmanites are positioned throughout his administration. People sometimes jokingly refer to - I guess jokingly is maybe not the right word. People sometimes sardonically refer to Goldman Sachs as Government Sachs. And - yes. And it's just - you know, it can start to seem like they're this shadow force of super smart Ivy League graduates dripping with money, secretly running the world, and no one knows whether for good or ill.

So when I went there, I sort of expected a kind of Hollywood version of an evil corporation, you know, with, like, waterfalls in the lobby and beautiful receptionists who also happen to be black belts in karate and possibly cyborgs. You know, like, sliding doors that you can't get through without a retinal scan - that sort of thing.

JOFFE-WALT: And it wasn't like that.

BLUMBERG: No, it was not like that. It was the same bored middle-aged security guard in a rented uniform, checking my ID and waving me through the elevator. And the building was actually kind of shabby. It was, like, sort of dull brown. There was nothing flashy about it. People in the elevator all looked like they'd be more at home in a graduate biology laboratory than stuck in the halls of Wall Street's most powerful firm. And then Lucas von Praag, their spokesman, he was much more open than I thought he'd be. I asked him about Goldman's recent earnings, and he was pretty straightforward about it.

VAN PRAAG: It was the most profitable quarter that we've had in terms of earnings since the firm went public in May of 1999.

BLUMBERG: And, as you know, we are here to talk about if the government can take credit for any of those - any of that earnings.

VAN PRAAG: I think the government can take quite a lot of credit for having stabilized the economic situation. That's certainly true. And so to the extent that we operate in economies that are directly affected by government intervention, the government can take the high level of - the government had a high level of involvement in the stability of the markets.

JOFFE-WALT: It sounds like he didn't quite want to say there that the government could take credit for Goldman, though.

BLUMBERG: Right. I mean, he is a flack, obviously, for Goldman Sachs, and he was watching his words carefully, but not as carefully as I thought he would. And we ended up having a surprisingly wide-ranging discussion about sort of pay and how much people should be paid and all that sort of stuff. And we'll play that for you in a minute. But this conversation requires a little bit of setup.

JOFFE-WALT: Right. OK. So the problem with these profits is that people say they're making money on the back of taxpayers. Wait a minute. We just gave these guys all this money, and now they're reporting huge profits.

BLUMBERG: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: And what we generally mean when we're talking about that is mostly people are talking about TARP. So remember, back in October last year, the government gave nine banks and financial firms billions of dollars. So Citigroup and Bank of America, for example, they each got 25 billion, and then they got a lot more money later. And Goldman Sachs, it got 10 - so 10 billion. And that money was considered, by some, a bit of a gift since it was given on much more favorable terms than the market was demanding. So, like, for instance, a couple days before the government stepped in, Warren Buffett, he gave $5 billion to Goldman Sachs, but at 10% interest. And the government, it charged only 5% interest.

BLUMBERG: But, Chana, I wasn't that interested in the TARP payments, partly because this week, Goldman basically finished paying back the TARP money and at a pretty good rate of return to the government. Basically, when all is said and done, Goldman ended up paying the government back at a 23% rate of return. So with respect to TARP and Goldman Sachs, we, the taxpayers, actually made out pretty well. But there are three other ways that people say the government has been subsidizing Goldman Sachs.

JOFFE-WALT: Subsidy No. 1 - AIG. And the story goes like this. When the government bailed out AIG, what they were really doing was bailing out Goldman Sachs. Of the 150 or so billion dollars that the government put into AIG, 13 billion of that went to Goldman Sachs. Therefore, the story goes, AIG owed Goldman Sachs a lot of money. And if AIG went under, then Goldman Sachs would have gone down, too.

BLUMBERG: Lucas says that story is not true. He says not only would Goldman not have gone under, he disputes the whole idea that they were owed $13 billion. He says that AIG owed them some money, but they had taken care of the risks and that if AIG had gone down, it would not have brought Goldman with it. You know, people dispute this claim. It's hard to see evidence either way. You know, nobody has, like, a smoking gun document that will prove Goldman's story versus other people's story.

JOFFE-WALT: But we have another questionable thing here, right?

BLUMBERG: Right.

JOFFE-WALT: Subsidy No. 2 - the Fed. Last September, Goldman Sachs, they did this tricky thing. They became a bank holding company. So this means that they were basically willingly saying regulate us more 'cause the Fed regulates bank holding companies pretty strictly. So why would they do that? They wanted to get access to the Federal Reserve lending. So the crisis last fall basically had to do with lending. And banks like Goldman, they're constantly borrowing money. If they - they need that money to do their businesses and survive. Last fall, it was really hard to borrow money. Private market basically froze them out. So they needed someone to lend them money. And the Federal Reserve, it lends money, but only if you're a bank holding company. So they became one. So did Morgan Stanley. They became bank holding companies.

BLUMBERG: Right. And to this, Lucas also says, well, yes and no. They did become a bank holding company, but mainly, he says, as a safety measure, as a precautionary measure, in case they needed to borrow money and to show the market that they could access money if they needed to.

He says that they did borrow a little bit of money from the Fed in the very beginning, but they paid that money back and they haven't borrowed any money from the Fed since. All the money they borrow now, they borrow from the market. Now, there's no way to really check this. The Fed doesn't release the names of institutions it lends to, so you can't really verify what Lucas said.

JOFFE-WALT: OK.

BLUMBERG: Exactly.

JOFFE-WALT: And this is where we start to bang our heads against the wall. All right, but he did actually admit that there was a third subsidy that helped Goldman Sachs out quite a bit, right? And that subsidy, it's very little known, but it's incredibly important program. It was also initiated in the wake of the crisis after Lehman's failure last September. So it was this program called the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. And basically, the program allowed Goldman and all the other financial firms out there to borrow money with a government guarantee.

BLUMBERG: And Goldman ended up borrowing $28 billion using the FDIC loan guarantee program. It still has that money that it borrowed. The program allowed Goldman to borrow this money at a very discounted interest rate. And it's possible without this guarantee, Goldman might not have been able to borrow money at all. I mean, that's how bad things were. So that would have been pretty devastating to their business, which leads us back to this question of compensation. Is it fair for Goldman Sachs to be making so much money when they might not be around at all if not for this FDIC program? And this is what I talked to Lucas van Praag about.

VAN PRAAG: The reason that the temporary loan guarantee program was put in place was because there was no ability for banks to borrow in the short maturity markets at all. Basically, the interbank market shut down. Banks didn't trust each other. This was following some - several very notable failures and increasing concern about what banks actually had on their balance sheets. And banks began to refuse to lend to each other. So the government's action in stepping in and providing the temporary loan guarantee program was absolutely crucial to prevent the collapse of the entire financial system.

BLUMBERG: And the collapse of Goldman Sachs?

VAN PRAAG: Would've been collapse of virtually every bank.

BLUMBERG: So if the government hadn't stepped in with that temporary loan guarantee program, you're saying your firm wouldn't have been able to survive?

VAN PRAAG: I think that our firm might have been able to survive, but I don't think there's any certainty that any firm would have been able to survive.

BLUMBERG: I guess then the question becomes, why do the rest of us care whether or not your firm and other firms survive?

VAN PRAAG: I think that not having a financial services sector would be very, very bad for any economy, and particularly for the United States. It would be completely horrendous.

BLUMBERG: Without Goldman Sachs and other firms like it?

VAN PRAAG: Without a financial services system, you know?

BLUMBERG: Right.

VAN PRAAG: If - and we're not just talking about Goldman Sachs. We're talking about all the banks that you could possibly name - Citigroup, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo.

BLUMBERG: Well, I don't - I mean, I don't want to - 'cause this is the essential question, sort of. It seems like if what you want is to continue surviving as a firm, you can make the claim that we are systemically important. And there's no doubt that we want a financial services system. I don't know if that means that we need every single firm to survive a big dust-up. And so when I'm asking about your firm or other firms specifically, I guess that's what I'm getting at. How do you know that you are systemically important? How do you know that you also needed to be saved? Other firms didn't get saved. It doesn't seem like we're going to save CIT, for example. We, you know, didn't save Lehman. Certain things - so did you know before this crisis that you were systemically important?

VAN PRAAG: I don't think that we had necessarily thought about ourselves as being systemically important or not. But the events of the crisis were quite cataclysmic for the banking sector as a whole, as we've seen. But I would put it in this context. You know, this firm has been around for 140 years. It is a company with nearly a trillion dollars in assets and pretty much the same amount of other people's money under management. So it's a big, big financial services company.

We play a critical role in the capital markets and we are now one of the few big players in the capital markets left standing. We've also been profitable every quarter since we went public in May of 1999, except for the fourth quarter of last year. And even for the whole of last year, 2008, we were profitable. So in terms of the prudential management of the organization, I think that most observers would say that they believed that we were a prudently managed firm and that we run our business very conservatively.

BLUMBERG: And so I guess what I'm saying, though, is that if you are systemically important and if what that means is periodically, say, if things get out of control, we need to rescue you - which is basically what that means, right? If you're systemically important, what that means is that occasionally, the taxpayers are going to have to step on the line. The government's going to have to step on the line if things get out of control and rescue you, right? Is that - it seems to me that's what that means.

VAN PRAAG: I think that that's certainly one interpretation that can be put on it. I think that the more constructive approach is to recognize that systemically important banks need to be run in ways that preclude the possibility of them getting into trouble. Now, one level, you can say - well, they should be utilities. Let's make them utilities. Let's make sure they take almost no risk and they borrow and lend in a very, very, very conservative way. And they don't use instruments that have inherent risk associated with them. The problem with that is that you will dramatically, negatively affect economic growth, and it will be a quite different world in which we live.

The converse is you allow people to do almost anything they want, which is clearly even worse. So I think that it's beholden on banks and their boards of directors and their management to manage them themselves appropriately, to have real competence in risk management, to understand the risks that they're taking, to understand the instruments they're using and the vehicles that they employ to take those risks. But I also think that it's incumbent upon society as a whole to ensure that the regulatory system is structured and staffed in a way that ensures that people who run banks are held to account.

BLUMBERG: Now, let me just get to a broader issue here, which is if you're looking back over the history of Goldman Sachs' earnings - 2006, 2007, spectacular earnings, huge compensation. Average compensation in those years is, according to one chart I read, which you might dispute, but something - almost half a million dollars per person in the firm in terms of compensation set aside. That includes bonuses, I guess, benefits and salary, which is just, you know, enormous amounts of money to the average person. A lot of that money was generated from trading activities from - you know, in this fixed-income arena where a lot of these housing derivative products were created. So a lot of that money came from producing and trading and selling and buying the things that led to the crisis. The crisis happens. Everybody's going to go under. We all get rescued. And then a year later, you're back on pace for the same type of earnings.

And it - I don't know what to say about it. I don't want, obviously, the second Great Depression. I don't want - I want to go to my ATM, and I want my money to be there. I don't wish anybody particularly ill. I don't want people not to be - make money if they earn it. Something about it seems unfair.

VAN PRAAG: Well, I think that the compensation is always a major hot topic, and understandably and particularly in an environment where people are losing their jobs, have lost their jobs, losing their homes, have lost their homes. And notwithstanding the fact that the statistics suggest that the rate at which people are losing their jobs and losing their homes is slowing, it's still happening, and it's miserable and entirely understandable that people would be angered by what they consider to be, as you described, a situation where people who were responsible or thought to be responsible for assisting in the creation of the crisis are seen to be apparently benefiting disproportionately. So you know, I think that you make a very good point. Now, you know, we work in an industry, in financial services, that is highly competitive, which hopefully has learnt a number of lessons and I think is reflective of views being expressed by legislators and regulators. And so the...

BLUMBERG: I mean, it seems to me, though, that the lesson would be, you know, a lot of the earnings from the last couple of years before the crisis were, we now know, due to taking on larger risks than people were aware of, that, you know, there was larger risks there and that - those risks weren't reflected in the earnings at the time. And then...

VAN PRAAG: I actually don't agree with that.

BLUMBERG: Oh, OK.

VAN PRAAG: I think that at some firms, that is probably entirely true. This firm - you know, we tend to be extraordinarily rigorous about risk management. You know, we don't want to pay people based on earnings that are completely illusory. That's nuts. That - you know, that way lies disaster. And, in fact, if you look at the firms that have failed, that way did lie disaster.

BLUMBERG: Right. But I guess what I'm saying is that you might very well have failed yourselves if there hadn't been sort of an unprecedented government intervention. And is there any part of that that - I guess the other argument that I find a little tiresome is that, like, this was a totally exogenous shock that happened to the system that we, the players in the system, had nothing to do with. Yeah.

VAN PRAAG: You will not get that argument from me. OK? I mean, that's certainly not the view of this firm.

BLUMBERG: Right.

VAN PRAAG: You know, and we have...

BLUMBERG: But did your firm have anything to do with the crisis, then, or was it all the other firms that did it? I guess that's what I'm saying.

VAN PRAAG: I don't think that you can single out one firm as having been the prime mover in the crisis or one firm that wasn't involved in the crisis.

BLUMBERG: Right.

VAN PRAAG: You know, I think that it was a collective failure. And I think that our industry collectively failed. They failed to protect shareholders, failed to execute the kind of proper stewardship that people have a right to expect.

BLUMBERG: Right. But now it seems like - it seems to an outside observer that, at least in the case of Goldman Sachs, in the current earnings, that failure is being rewarded in that you're on pace for record earnings and that without the rescue by the government, you wouldn't be in a position to be there. What do you say to that?

VAN PRAAG: Would it be better if we had actually...

BLUMBERG: Well, leave aside whether it would be better or not. I mean, I don't know. That's the question that - I guess that's a dodge. It's hard to know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, obviously you think it would be better. Maybe it wouldn't be better. There's no way to know.

VAN PRAAG: Well, let me answer your question. OK. Do I think that in the crisis that looked like it was threatening to engulf the industry in September or October, that we would have gone bust? No, I don't. We had extraordinarily high levels of liquidity. We had a very, very long-term borrowing book. We knew what the value of our assets were. We knew that if we had to, we could sell them and that we wouldn't be taking huge write-downs because we'd already marked them to market. So I don't believe that it would have spelled the demise of Goldman Sachs.

BLUMBERG: So then what are we to make of the fact that you got assistance then? Why did the government help you out then?

VAN PRAAG: You know, the government help-out, as you put it, was really in two forms. First, the Treasury determined that nine banks would receive capital from the Treasury in the form of the TARP money. There was no choice associated with that.

BLUMBERG: Right.

VAN PRAAG: We were simply told this is going to happen. These are the terms.

BLUMBERG: And you have repaid that money at very favorable terms to the Treasury, everybody, we should note.

VAN PRAAG: We've repaid the money. In fact, we repaid the - we redeemed the warrants yesterday at a 23% return for the taxpayer, which we think is entirely appropriate, by the way. But, you know, would we complain about having received that money? No. It would be quite wrong and churlish and ridiculous to complain about getting that money. Did we need it? No. In fact, two weeks before we got it, we'd raised nearly $11 billion in the private markets, including 5 billion from Warren Buffett. So we didn't need more capital. But in the environment in which it was given to us, you know, people certainly felt safer and sounder as a result of banks being shored up.

BLUMBERG: So it's quite a dance, huh?

JOFFE-WALT: Alex, when you came back from this interview, I kept asking you, you know, so does he say that we kept them alive - that is, our money and these government programs that's kept them alive and mean that has led to all these big profits? And I don't - I mean, I guess he's saying no.

BLUMBERG: He sort of goes back and forth a little bit. In the beginning, he sort of says, we might have survived. We might not have. And then in the end, he sort of comes around to saying, like, no, no, I'm going to tell you, we would have survived. It felt good simply to pose these questions to somebody and at least have them respond. You know, his responses were dodgy, as you might expect.

But also, I do have to give him credit. He seemed actually eager to talk about this in a way that other players have not been. And when I left, he had another meeting he had to go to, but he said, you know, come back any time. I felt like we were just getting into it. I want to keep on talking about this stuff with you. He was very happy to have a microphone in front of his face. He was very happy to have it edited. He said nothing is off the table when I talk to him.

So the conditions under which we did this interview were very, very different. And I feel like, listening back, there's a whole bunch of things that I felt like I wanted to ask him. And I'm sure our listeners have a lot of questions that they would like me to pose to Mr. van Praag.

JOFFE-WALT: That sounds like a listener question there.

BLUMBERG: So I would definitely want to take him up on his offer to come back and talk to him more. And I feel like if there are people out there who have specifics that they want me to lob in his direction, I would be happy to do it.

JOFFE-WALT: I feel like the interesting thing there is that I'm always curious how these firms think about themselves now, if they - you're asking, are you systemically important? You know, and if they all think they're systemically important and they know that that means that they'll be guaranteed a rescue, what does that mean for all of us? So it's interesting to hear someone in that position just how they perceive themselves now.

BLUMBERG: Right. Right. And I do - and it is interesting, when I said, did you know, that was a very - it was a legitimate question. I don't know if they did know, you know? Maybe they did. I don't know.

JOFFE-WALT: OK. Well, if you all have questions, you can post them at npr.org/money. You can send us an email, planetmoney@npr.org.

I am ready to know the results already of this PLANET MONEY-"Dancing With The Stars"-"Iron Chef" competition.

BLUMBERG: Well, and lucky for you, our very own Caitlin Kenney is in the studio with us with those very results. Right, Caitlin?

CAITLIN KENNEY, BYLINE: Hey, guys.

BLUMBERG: Hey.

JOFFE-WALT: Hi, Caitlin.

KENNEY: So I think we do need a new name for this competition.

BLUMBERG: I think definitely.

KENNEY: One of our listeners actually had a few suggestions on the blog, and they're pretty good. PLANET MONEY Idol, Iron Podcaster, NPR's Got Talent - and my personal favorite - So You Think You Can Report Economics?

BLUMBERG: Oh, I like that one.

KENNEY: That one's good, right?

BLUMBERG: That's the one, yeah.

KENNEY: Maybe for our next competition. OK.

So we have the results. I have to say, we've been monitoring this. We've been keeping an eye on it. I was really surprised by the winner. Not to say that this person in question didn't deserve to win. I'm just saying it really seemed like it wasn't going to go this way.

BLUMBERG: It was a come from behind.

JOFFE-WALT: Caitlin, I worked. I worked really hard. I don't know why you'd be surprised about this.

KENNEY: Chana, I have some...

JOFFE-WALT: Yes?

KENNEY: ...Sad news.

JOFFE-WALT: Oh, no.

KENNEY: You are not the winner of the challenge. I'm sorry.

JOFFE-WALT: Tears are streaming down my face.

KENNEY: I know. It's true. But we do have the official tally - 4,098 people voted. So, first of all, we just got to say thanks for everyone for taking part. That's awesome. It's really great.

But today's winner is - dun, duh, duh, duh - Adam Davidson with 1,589 votes, capturing 39% of the total vote.

BLUMBERG: Wow.

JOFFE-WALT: Wow.

BLUMBERG: Now, see, this is so weird because he was, like, trailing all week long, right?

KENNEY: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: So what happened?

KENNEY: I don't know. I'm really - it seems like there was a late-night, last-minute surge. I don't know.

BLUMBERG: What's the group that monitors international elections?

KENNEY: Should we give them a call?

BLUMBERG: I know.

KENNEY: Actually, speaking of calls, though, I think we should, you know, check in with Adam and see what he thinks of the news. He's not in today, so.

BLUMBERG: Oh, that's right. He's out on a little vacation today.

KENNEY: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: A vacation day. So let's - you want to call him and...

JOFFE-WALT: Voting on various computers all across the USA?

BLUMBERG: Exactly.

KENNEY: He was mysteriously unavailable today. Just saying.

BLUMBERG: Yeah, you want to call him and see...

KENNEY: Yeah.

BLUMBERG: All right.

KENNEY: Let's call him up. All right. We got this number right here.

BLUMBERG: OK.

JOFFE-WALT: He's going to be so happy.

BLUMBERG: OK. And we've got Adam on the line. Adam?

ADAM DAVIDSON, BYLINE: Hello?

BLUMBERG: Hello?

DAVISON: Hey.

BLUMBERG: Hey. So, Adam, we're here on the podcast right now. We're calling you on your cellphone, on your day off, to tell you some news. Caitlin?

KENNEY: You're the winner.

DAVISON: What?

KENNEY: It's true.

DAVISON: No, I was losing.

KENNEY: I know. Miraculously, you now have 1,589 votes.

DAVISON: Are you serious?

KENNEY: Yes.

DAVISON: Wow. That's so funny. I just relistened to the whole podcast this morning. And - my wife and I - and we came up with all these different reasons why I lost - to make me feel better. That's awesome.

BLUMBERG: Oh, well, congratulations.

DAVISON: Thank you. I'm shocked.

JOFFE-WALT: Congratulations, Adam.

DAVISON: Thrilled.

JOFFE-WALT: Good game.

BLUMBERG: Now, I have to say, there was a little bit of mystery because you were trailing up until very recently. And then all of a sudden, you had a late surge that happened to correspond exactly with the days you took off.

DAVISON: Well, that is mysterious. But we did go to All Things Considered on Wednesday. And then I took off Thursday and Friday, so.

BLUMBERG: I'm going to need to see receipts and alibis before I can certify these results.

DAVISON: No, I can assure you I did not...

BLUMBERG: You weren't tapping on your computer...

DAVISON: No.

BLUMBERG: ...And voting over and over again.

DAVISON: And Laura told me that - well, we do know for a fact that Chana's sister voted multiple times.

JOFFE-WALT: She did. She told me.

DAVISON: I don't think she voted for me multiple times, but...

JOFFE-WALT: She said a bazillion times, actually.

DAVISON: A bazillion times. But Caitlin or Laura, someone assured us.

KENNEY: Yes. We had some protective measures in place to keep people from tricking the system.

DAVISON: Hey. Jen, I won.

JEN BANBURY: I'm looking at it right now.

BLUMBERG: All right, Adam.

KENNEY: Thanks.

DAVISON: All right. Thanks, guys.

BLUMBERG: We'll say goodbye to you. And I think we will say goodbye to the rest of you out there.

Caitlin, thanks for joining us.

KENNEY: No problem.

BLUMBERG: All of you out there, send your thoughts, comments, pictures, ideas, questions for Mr. Lucas van Praag to us here. You can send it to our Twitter feed, email, Facebook, all those things that I don't understand.

JOFFE-WALT: We're here everywhere.

BLUMBERG: I'm told they're out there. I'm Alex Blumberg.

JOFFE-WALT: And I'm Chana Joffe-Walt. Thanks for listening.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "RETURN OF THE MACK")

MORRISON: (Singing) But I do, but I do, do, do. Return of the Mack. It is return of the Mack. Come on. Return of the Mack. Oh, my God. You know that I'll be back. Here I am. Return of the Mack. Yes it is. Return of the Mack. Yes it is. Return of the Mack. Yes it is. You know that I'll be back.
