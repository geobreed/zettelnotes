Almost a year into the financial crisis, we ask foreign policy analyst Ian Bremmer to take stock of America's position in the world. Bremmer, author of The Fat Tail and president of the risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, says America has lost some of its power. Bremmer gives two reasons for that. First, he says, other countries have recovered from the crisis more quickly. The second, he says, is that the crisis has forced U.S. leaders to pay more attention to domestic affairs and play a less active role on the global stage. On the upside, Bremmer says this is a great time to invest in Iraq.
