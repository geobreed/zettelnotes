On today's Planet Money: Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group and professor Kishore Mahbubani of the National University of Singapore take us on a brief world tour. Mahbubani, author of the New Asian Hemisphere, argues that the most of the world is preparing for China's coming global dominance. It's a psychological adjustment that Americans aren't yet ready to make. Bremmer, author of The Fat Tail, says that if the Chinese economy remains state-controlled, American businesses won't get a level playing field. But Americans shouldn't necessarily fear the rise of China, because the U.S. and China will continue to need each other for many years to come.
