In the best tradition of The Bachelor, financial institutions get to choose from a small flock of regulators. Those regulators collect fees for their work, so they're hot to woo potential companies. The Planet Money Players, with special guest Dina Temple Raston, show you how it's done as they vie for the affections of one Adam Isaac Gavidson, better known as AIG.
