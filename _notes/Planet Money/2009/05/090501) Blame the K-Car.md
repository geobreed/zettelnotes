Chrysler headed for bankruptcy today, pushed there by President Obama in the latest twist in the surreal saga of the American automobile industry. NPR's Frank Langfitt checks in from his rounds of UAW union halls, where we hear from a Chrysler worker who says the cars his company makes just aren't good enough. Another worker says he's surprised a UAW health care trust fund ended up as a majority owner of the company, since he sat through days of votes on wage concessions without hearing a word about it. Plus: We asked whether you bore any blame for wrecking the global economy, and whether you were up for apologizing on our Planet Money apology line. You were. We're leaving the line open.
