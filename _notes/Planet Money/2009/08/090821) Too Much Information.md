Doctors know plenty about you and your ailments, but what do you know about them?. Robert Krughoff, of Consumer Checkbook, has a new website, Patient Central, that uses detailed survey information obtained by actual patients to measure doctor performance. Sometimes a little bit of information can be too much. Naked Economist Charlie Wheelan says knowing our genetic makeup is good for us but bad for the insurance industry. Wheelan argues that as soon as our insurance pool is "corrupted" by this information, healthy people will begin to opt out and people likely to get sick forced to opt in at higher rates.

On today's Planet Money:

Information problems are some of the biggest hurdles in fixing health care. Doctors know plenty about you and your ailments, but you aren't usually given much information about them in return. Choosing your physician is an important decision, but how can you know if you are making a good choice? Robert Krughoff of Consumer Checkbook says he's got a new website, Patient Central, that makes finding a good doctor a whole lot easier. The website uses detailed survey information obtained by actual patients to measure doctor performance. One of the site's top rated docs, Dr. David Graham, says he likes the idea but thinks it isn't perfect.

Plus, a health care paradox. Sometimes you can have too much information. Naked Economist Charlie Wheelan says knowing our genetic makeup is good for us but bad for the insurance industry. Wheelan argues that as soon as our insurance pool is "corrupted" by this information, healthy people will begin to opt out and people likely to get sick will be forced to opt in at higher rates.

This letter comes to us from Melanie S., a nurse whose husband is a radiology resident:

    I take issue with your comparison of doctors to mechanics. On the
    surface this is pretty good. Both professions carry a skill set not
    many share. We have to put our trust in them that they are knowledgeable
    and competent. The bills are also similar. Little fees tacked on after
    the procedure. Frustrating. But by oversimplifying with such
    analogies, I think you run the risk of breeding resentment. The mechanic
    did not spend $250,000 dollars becoming educated and skilled. The
    mechanic did not work 80 hours a week in order to become competent. The
    mechanic doesn't work weekends, nights and holidays. You should do a
    podcast on the cost of training doctors.

    I nearly blew my stack when the idea of paying doctors based on their
    patients outcome was proposed. I have a better idea. Health insurance
    should be more like life insurance. Everyone is eligible but you will
    be charged for certain things. I believe everyone should qualify for
    health care and if you have a condition that was not created by the
    patient (type I diabetes, autoimmune disorders, genetic defects...) then
    you may pay bit more but you still have affordable insurance. If you
    suffer from poor health due to obesity, smoking, drug or alcohol abuse
    then you pay higher premiums. There needs to be more patient
    accountability for their own health. Until a doctor can admit an obese
    patient with heart disease into the hospital and control their diet and
    exercise for months until they lose weight then we can pay doctors based
    on outcomes. There is an idea for a podcast — how much does obesity,
    smoking, alcohol and drug abuse cost the system?
