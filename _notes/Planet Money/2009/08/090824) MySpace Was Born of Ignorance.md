Not knowing what to fear, the entrepreneurs just dove in. It gave them a great beginning — and an Achilles heel.

DeWolfe and Anderson came to their social networking juggernaut from the world of porn and spyware. Their greatest asset? Complete ignorance, Angwin says. Not knowing what to fear, the entrepreneurs just dove in. It gave them a great beginning, Angwin says, but became an Achilles heel.
