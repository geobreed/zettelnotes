A lot of folks want to know who's to blame for the Great Recession. Investment manager Liaquat Ahamed says he knows who's to blame for the Great Depression. Ahamed, author of Lords of Finance: The Bankers Who Broke the World, blames that economic collapse on the boneheaded policies of the leading central bankers. Ahamed says much of the problem stemmed with a return to the gold standard.
