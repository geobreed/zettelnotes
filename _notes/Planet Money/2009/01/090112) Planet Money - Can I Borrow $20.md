If you can't get a loan from a bank, maybe you can get one from your friends or family. That's the idea, loosely, behind a peer-to-peer lending site like Prosper.com. Clay Shirky, New Media professor at New York University and author of Here Comes Everybody, says it appeared to be working, at least until the SEC shut it down.
