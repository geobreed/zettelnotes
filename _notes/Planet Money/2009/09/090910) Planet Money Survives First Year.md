On today's Planet Money, Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg spent the summer of 2008 working on the story that would launch Planet Money — a Chana Joffe-Walt report about the connection between Chinese windmills and U.S. airplanes. But a funny thing happened on the way to that first feature: in a terrifying series of financial calamities last summer, the global economy darned near died. What began as the month we all started thinking about Too Big Too Fail turned into Planet Money's first crazy, crazy year. You were there. Celebrate it with us in this anniversary podcast.
