On today's Planet Money: Rich nations and developing ones in the G20 got together in Pittsburgh this week to discuss the fate of the world. Also, how to fix it. Among the key issues was how to give emerging markets a meaningful seat at the table. For starters, the G20 will now replace the G8, which includes only leading nations. David Gordon, head of research at Eurasia Group, says that's a start, a small one. Meanwhile, NPR's Scott Horsley ventured out past the protesters in search of an alternative G20 scene.
