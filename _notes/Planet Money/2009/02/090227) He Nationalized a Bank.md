William Isaac calls himself the only person in America who has ever nationalized a bank. Isaac, who led the FDIC during the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s, doesn't recommend it. Plus: Economists reveal what they heard in Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's interview with Planet Money, and an architect watches her business disappear.

On today's Planet Money:

-- William Isaac says he's the only person in America who has ever nationalized a bank. Isaac, who led the FDIC during the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s, doesn't recommend it. (Isaac's WSJ op-ed.)

-- Ever since U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner gave an interview to Planet Money this week, listeners have debated whether he said anything of substance. Now three economists — Amir Sufi, Russ Roberts and Simon Johnson — reveal what they heard.

-- Architect Celeste Lewis runs her own shop in Portland, Ore. She says business has almost dried up, and the end may not be far.
