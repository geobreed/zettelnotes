Teachers made a deal with the Department of Education. They kept their end of the bargain. Why didn't the government?



Kaitlyn McCollum at Columbia Central High School in Tennessee.
Stacy Kranitz/NPR

A Department of Education program gives talented, up-and-coming teachers a grant, not a loan, to help them pay for college. The condition: After you graduate, you have to teach in a low-income school.

Thousands of teachers kept their end of that bargain but had their grants turned to loans anyway after sending in a required form a day late or accidentally missing a signature. Some are in crippling debt because of it.

Two NPR reporters spent a year and a half getting to the heart of this bureaucratic nightmare. Today on the show, we learn what they found, and how it changed a department.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

KAITLYN MCCOLLUM: All right, padlock is gone (ph), and it is recording.

KENNY MALONE, HOST:

This recording is the first time that Kaitlyn McCollum talked to NPR. She was teaching Spanish at a public high school in Tennessee. Most of her students came from a relatively low-income, rural community.

K MCCOLLUM: I told them today that I had an interview with you all. And many of them, as they left class, said, good luck, good luck, Miss McCollum. We really hope things, you know, are put into motion from this interview.

MALONE: Back in college, Kaitlyn had made this deal with the United States Department of Education - she promised to teach at a low-income school for four years. In exchange, the DOE gave her $16,000 for college, free and clear, not a loan. After three years of doing exactly what she said she would, she got the letter.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: I remember going out to the mailbox. I even opened it up at the mailbox, came inside. And sheer panic just set in.

MALONE: The letter was about the deal Kaitlyn had made with the Department of Education. Yes, she had spent three years teaching exactly where she said she would, but there was a problem with Kaitlyn's paperwork saying that she was teaching where she said she would. The government had allegedly received that paperwork two or maybe three days late.

Seemingly not a big problem, after all, they got the paperwork, except, as the letter explained, in this case, the punishment was that the entire deal was now torn up and canceled. Kaitlyn was going to have to repay the Department of Education every penny they gave her back in college.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: I remember my husband coming in the house, and I was sobbing, just absolutely sobbing. And we actually had just found out that I was pregnant with our first child. And then to be hit with this, I feel like it's so very unjust and unethical but that there's nothing that I can do because I'm such a small fish against the federal government.

(SOUNDBITE OF AARON KELLEY'S "MAKING BIG PLANS")

MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone. And for more than a year, two of our colleagues at NPR have been investigating stories like Kaitlyn McCollum's and discovered that thousands of teachers across the country made a deal to help struggling schools, did what they promised and were ultimately rewarded with millions of dollars of debt. Today on the show, the story of how the Department of Education turned into what many teachers felt was a ruthless predatory lender.

So how does this begin? You get, like, a tip from a - I don't know, like, somebody in a trenchcoat. What - how does this go?

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: (Laughter) It's sort of like that. So yeah, I mean, I actually got an encrypted message on my phone. That's kind of exciting.

MALONE: That's pretty legit.

ARNOLD: I mean, it's trenchcoat in a way.

MALONE: This is Chris Arnold. He's an investigative reporter at NPR who covers consumer protection.

ARNOLD: Yeah, so I get this tip, and it's basically like, look; there's stuff worth digging into around the Department of Education and things that are going on. And that gets me to look at this lawsuit. And as I'm digging through, I see this mention of this program called the TEACH Grant program.

MALONE: And had you ever heard of this before?

ARNOLD: No, not at all.

CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Yeah. And, Kenny, I'm reading this lawsuit at the same time Chris is.

MALONE: This is Cory Turner, also at NPR, also worked on this investigation.

TURNER: And I'm the education reporter. And I do the same thing - I stumble across TEACH Grant. Huh, never heard of it.

MALONE: The TEACH Grant program started more than a decade ago.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Will the members in the aisles please take their conversations to the back of the chamber?

MALONE: TEACH was just a small part of this bill called the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007. It was sponsored by a Democratic representative named George Miller.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GEORGE MILLER: For students who are excelling in college and want to teach, if they make a commitment to teach in difficult public schools, we will provide $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while they're in school.

MALONE: So prospective teachers could get up to $16,000 free and clear if they went and taught at a low-income school after they graduated. But if for some reason somebody took that money and then didn't go and teach like they promised, there was this provision that allowed the government to say, hey, listen, you got to give us that money back.

TURNER: Yeah, that grant is going to become a loan.

ARNOLD: Yeah, and that's totally reasonable, right? I mean, because if someone said, yeah, sure, man, I'll become a teacher, and then they go backpacking...

MALONE: What - is the teacher in your universe from "Fast Times At Ridgemont High?"

TURNER: (Laughter).

ARNOLD: Well, no, that's what I'm saying, like, it would be, like, a "Fast Times At Ridgemont High"-type guy...

MALONE: I see.

ARNOLD: ...Who's like, yeah, man, I'll take the 16 grand, and then they just go screw off. Like, of course, the government's going to want its money back.

MALONE: But Cory and Chris, after reporting out that encrypted trenchcoaty (ph) message, had started to hear that this nuclear option, converting the grant into a loan, was being used for the smallest stuff - paperwork errors, a missed signature, filing a form a day late. So they started calling teachers who had had this happen.

TURNER: David, you're using your voice memo recorder, right?

DAVID WEST: Right, I've got it running right now.

TURNER: Excellent.

MALONE: One of the first teachers they found was a guy named David West. One day, David also got one of those letters saying your paperwork was a couple days late, your TEACH Grant is now a TEACH loan. Pay up.

WEST: Initially, my feeling was surely this is a mistake, surely this can't be that big a deal. Let me call them up.

MALONE: So he gets somebody on the phone. And he explains, like, hey, I'm teaching where I'm supposed to. Can we just get this cleared up? And the person is like, no, you were two days late. And technically, we are now allowed to turn your grant into a loan. And David is like, what? I was two days late on paperwork. And essentially, the fine for that is that I now owe thousands of dollars.

WEST: If I had not done the job, fine, I owe you the money. I did the job. And they're like loan sharks. I mean, I'm surprised nobody showed up to cap my knees with a bat.

MALONE: Again, David is not dealing with some shady, payday lender. This is a program run by the United States Department of Education.

WEST: I couldn't believe it. I was floored. And I, like, went - you know, you go through let me talk to your supervisor, blah, blah, blah. You can talk to - she said you can talk to who you want. And there's also an appeals process, and you can try to appeal this if you want, but nobody ever wins. That's exactly what she said to me out of the gate.

TURNER: Wow. Really?

WEST: Yes. I wish I'd recorded that call.

TURNER: I remember thinking, in the moment, as soon as he said that, does that mean that the folks in this call center hear this so often that, like, they just know to say it - like, sorry, buddy, don't even bother?

ARNOLD: Yeah. And so like, we start asking around. And we manage to get our hands on this internal report that the ED department had actually done on this TEACH program. And in there was the answer to our question of, well, how many teachers have gotten screwed up like this?

MALONE: It was a shocking number.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

DAVID GREENE: We have some exclusive reporting from NPR to bring you this morning.

MALONE: Chris and Cory ran a story about the internal TEACH Grant report that they'd gotten a hold of.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

TURNER: One in three people who lost their grants said they did meet those teaching requirements or were likely to.

ARNOLD: The report estimates, based on a representative survey, that it's upwards of 12,000 teachers, and it could be a lot more.

MALONE: The Department of Education wouldn't talk to Chris and Cory on tape for this story, but they did give this written statement. They kind of said, oh, yeah, these numbers do not look good. We're going to have to look into this. That radio story ran in March of 2018.

ARNOLD: You know, you do a story, you get some feedback. On this one, it was like Twitter exploded. Email inboxes exploded - teachers saying this is exactly what happened to me - upset, sad, angry - so many people telling us they got hurt.

MALONE: One of those people was Kaitlyn McCollum, the teacher that you heard at the very beginning of this episode.

K MCCOLLUM: All right, guys, can you team up for me? Get in your color groups for me.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: Yeah.

K MCCOLLUM: Awesome.

MALONE: Kaitlyn, of course, teaches at a low-income school in Tennessee. But the first time Cory and Chris met her in person was on a student field trip to Washington, D.C. Kaitlyn was a chaperone. They met up at this pretty noisy shopping mall food court where Kaitlyn explained how her family had built their life around her TEACH Grants.

ARNOLD: So you guys made, like, life decisions based on what kind of school you had to teach in because of these grants.

K MCCOLLUM: Absolutely. We - every year, it seems that we've had a different opportunity or at least option that we could have looked into had we not been in this predicament.

MALONE: To get a sense of how big these life tradeoffs were, you just need to talk to Kaitlyn's husband A.J., who also happened to be on this trip.

A J MCCOLLUM: Yes, the way that the grant was structured, Kaitlyn had to teach in a...

MALONE: A.J. and Kaitlyn moved specifically to a place where Kaitlyn could fulfill her TEACH Grant requirements. A.J. happens to be in the military. And after they'd already moved, A.J. found out that he had qualified for flight school.

A MCCOLLUM: Which was, I mean, obviously a dream. Anybody that's - that has any interest in the military, if you qualify to be a pilot, that's one of those things that it's surreal. So we had to look at that and say, well, we can't leave.

MALONE: Kaitlyn and A.J. ran the math. And unfortunately for A.J., it just made economic sense for them to stay where they were. Kaitlyn could keep teaching, keep her grants, and they wouldn't get buried in debt. A.J. passed on his flight school dream so that Kaitlyn could keep her promise to the Department of Education. And then, of course, Kaitlyn got that letter. A.J. got home from work one day, and Kaitlyn was in tears.

A MCCOLLUM: She said, I don't know what we're going to do. And I said, I'll tell you we're not paying it back. And she said, well, we can't do that. And I said I wear a uniform with a flag on my sleeve. They're not taking our money. It's wrong. And that's - that was the culmination of our conversation that night.

MALONE: As you heard earlier, Kaitlyn's paperwork was allegedly late by two or three days. But what we didn't mention is that it's not just that Kaitlyn's entire $16,000 in grants was suddenly converted to a loan. The way this is enforced is that they kind of go back in time and say, oh, well, actually, these grants now, they were always loans. And clearly, you haven't been paying down that loan because of course you haven't because you had no idea it was a loan. But that doesn't matter.

And so now there's all this backdated interest piled up. And so with interest, Kaitlyn actually now owed around $21,000 and counting. And for Kaitlyn, who was making around $30,000 a year, that was a sudden, massive financial burden.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: Sometimes I can go a whole week and not even think about this whole issue. And then I'll be doing something so menial, like washing dishes or taking a shower, and then it'll just hit me like a ton of bricks. Like, oh my, God, I owe all of that money, and it still isn't fixed. And what am I going to do? And it's, like, a knee-buckling moment of panic all over again.

MALONE: After the break, how to try and fix a bureaucracy at a Starbucks.

What Chris and Cory had found was this classic spirit-of-the-law-versus-letter-of-the-law problem. Technically, messed up paperwork or whatever violated this deal that thousands of teachers had made with the government. But what really was that deal? It was to go and teach in a low-income school. So Cory and Chris figured, if they could just explain this to the right people at the Department of Education, surely this is the kind of thing that could get fixed.

TURNER: So we set up this meeting with some officials at the Department of Ed. And we get coffee. We go to Starbucks. We sit outside on the patio. And Chris is flown down from Boston. So he's there in his snappy jacket (laughter).

ARNOLD: Did I have a snappy jacket?

TURNER: You always wore the same snappy jacket.

MALONE: A lot of this meeting was off the record. But Cory and Chris say they can share a general sense of the meeting. They told the sources about Kaitlyn McCollum and what kind of a teacher she was.

TURNER: Like, this is exactly the kind of person you wanted going through this program. And now here she is suffering because of it. It doesn't make any sense. It's not right. And so I remember you just kept asking, why can't you just fix it?

ARNOLD: Yeah. Like, the moment that I remember - like, you know, can it just be as simple as if they're teaching in a low-income school, they get their grants back because who cares about the paperwork stuff?

MALONE: Right. Yeah.

ARNOLD: And there was, like, a long pause and kind of a shake of the head (laughter). And it would be like - it was something like - Cory, what did it - what was it - it was - the answer was something like, well, that would be nice, but you just don't understand how complicated that is.

TURNER: Yeah - not that they necessarily disagreed. They were telling us, we're not sure that's even possible.

MALONE: So Cory and Chris were like, OK. I guess we will just keep doing this story, especially now that they had met the perfect example of how badly this could go.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: It's been two years of torture.

TURNER: Kaitlyn McCollum is a high school teacher...

MALONE: Again, for this story, the Department of Education would not do an on-tape interview. But on the exact same morning that this story ran, the Secretary of Education was scheduled to testify in Congress about something completely unrelated to the TEACH Grant program.

Were you intentionally trolling the secretary of education...

(LAUGHTER)

ARNOLD: No.

MALONE: ...By running a story about Kaitlyn the morning that DeVos was supposed to testify on Capitol Hill about other things?

ARNOLD: I think the honest answer is no. But had we, like, actually thought about it, we very well may have trolled her.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VIRGINIA FOXX: It's a privilege to welcome Secretary DeVos for her first appearance before the education workforce committee.

MALONE: Intentional or not, it appeared to have worked because at least one House representative, or his staffer maybe, happened to catch the Kaitlyn story on NPR. It was the ranking Democrat of the House Education and Labor Committee, Bobby Scott.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BOBBY SCOTT: There's a report this morning of the debacle going on with teachers who have fulfilled - in the process of fulfilling their loan forgiveness requirements.

MALONE: Technically, not a loan forgiveness program but close enough, Bobby Scott.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SCOTT: How long have you - this department known about that?

BETSY DEVOS: Are you speaking of the TEACHER Grant program?

SCOTT: Right.

DEVOS: We are aware of the issues within that program and have taken steps to address the issues therein.

SCOTT: Do you need legislation to fix it?

DEVOS: I don't believe so.

TURNER: DeVos acknowledges - yeah, we got this. That's basically what she says. We've got this.

ARNOLD: I mean, the question is - you know, is that just, like, a blow-off?

TURNER: Yeah.

ARNOLD: Or is that - no, really. We're committed. And at that point, we don't have any idea.

MALONE: The Department of Education had already announced a top-to-bottom review of the TEACH Grant program, likely in response to some of Chris and Cory's earlier reporting. And so they kept going. They worked with a lawyer from the organization Public Citizen, who'd managed to get hundreds of documents about the TEACH Grant program under the Freedom of Information Act.

Do you learn that the program is better or worse than you thought?

TURNER: You know...

ARNOLD: Definitely worse.

(LAUGHTER)

TURNER: The crazy thing about it is that things just kept appearing.

MALONE: For example, Chris and Cory found this memo written by the contractor that the Department of Education had hired to kind of deal with the TEACH Grant program. This contractor was writing a memo to the Department of Education about the program.

TURNER: Basically, this memo says, you know, guys, we're actually converting to loans a lot of teachers who seem to be meeting the spirit of the program. And maybe that's not such a good idea.

MALONE: Wait. They had found the exact same thing you had found?

TURNER: Yeah, basically.

ARNOLD: Even this company is waving its flag, saying, please don't make us hurt these teachers. And nothing happens.

MALONE: And then Chris and Cory found that there was this whole other pool of TEACH Grant teachers, as many as 10,000, who had mistakenly had their TEACH grants turned into loans.

TURNER: Like, by mistake - this isn't even the paperwork thing.

ARNOLD: Yeah.

TURNER: This is a just a screw-up.

ARNOLD: They weren't even a day late or anything. Right. Yeah.

TURNER: And then that raised the question for us. Well, geez. What'd they do about it? Well, the answer is not a lot.

MALONE: But slowly, over the course of, like, seven months, Cory and Chris say the tone from their sources at the Department of Education just started to change from we don't know if it's possible to fix this to we think this might be possible to we think we can actually fix this. And I kept asking Cory and Chris, like, OK. But why did it change? Who changed it? Who was the evil person hurting teachers? And Chris and Cory kept saying, no. No. It's not like that. That's not always how these government-meant-well-but-screwed-it-all-up stories go.

TURNER: I think, you know, one really important lesson for me in all this is, like, we love our stories to have a villain.

MALONE: Yeah.

TURNER: And I think, for the longest time, I just assumed that the department was the villain or that the - you know, the company that managed the program for the department was the villain.

ARNOLD: Yeah. It must be making money off us...

TURNER: Yeah.

ARNOLD: ...Somehow. There's some kind of scam. Yeah. Yeah.

TURNER: I mean, we looked at all the angles. Like, who's profiting off this?

ARNOLD: Right. Right. And people hear the stories. And that's the immediate response, too. Like, people will tweet out, you know, oh, this company must be getting rich on the back of these teachers and corruption, corruption.

TURNER: And the scary thing is this is 2019. And the villain was bureaucracy.

ARNOLD: And it was a bureaucracy that spanned the Bush administration, the Obama administration and the first half the Trump administration. I mean - and this just was this machine that was not being changed. You know, it was chugging along, hurting people.

TURNER: The good news, for me, is that ultimately that bureaucracy is made of humans. And if we just convinced enough of those humans to change direction and move toward a kinder, gentler program, it actually happened.

ARNOLD: Yeah.

MALONE: Finally, after more than a year, Chris and Cory got word from the Department of Education. It was top secret, but the deal was done. The department was going to agree that if teachers could prove they were and still are going to keep their end of the deal then the department would convert their loans back into grants. Again, this was not public information yet. But Cory and Chris couldn't wait. They wanted to tell Kaitlyn McCollum themselves. So they asked a local producer to go over to Kaitlyn's house.

K MCCOLLUM: Hi. Hi.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)

A MCCOLLUM: Oh, hush. I'm going to have to put them out. Come on. Come on.

MALONE: That's Kaitlyn and her husband A.J. And this was back in December. A.J. deals with the dogs. Kaitlyn and the producer, Lexi, sit down by the phone so Chris and Cory can talk to Kaitlyn.

K MCCOLLUM: Yes. Lexi and I are sitting in my living room looking at my pine needles all over the floor because we put up our Christmas tree last night.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

ARNOLD: I think we've got some good news here for you, actually.

K MCCOLLUM: OK.

TURNER: As long as you can now prove that you were still meeting the teaching requirements, you're doing what you promised you do, you're going to get your grants back.

K MCCOLLUM: Are you serious (laughter)? Oh, my God. (Laughter) Sorry. I'm (laughter) - oh, goodness. Oh, that is such good news. Oh, that's such good news. So I...

TURNER: And I remember Lexi, our engineer, telling us that she went to the other room where her husband A.J. was with their son. And they had a baby gate. And, you know, our story begins with her at the mailbox getting that letter when she's pregnant. Her son is now - I think he's, like, 2. And as she's telling A.J. that it's all over...

K MCCOLLUM: So we have to keep it under wraps until Monday.

TURNER: ...She's leaning over the baby gate on one side. And he's leaning over the baby gate on the other side. And they're hugging.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: We get to go back to living life (laughter) like we did prior. Thank you. So you have us both - well, at least I'm in tears. I don't know. But...

A MCCOLLUM: I'm going to walk away.

K MCCOLLUM: (Laughter) My husband's walking away.

MALONE: Throughout this entire, like, year of reporting, Chris and Cory had trouble getting anybody from the Department of Education to actually record an interview on tape. But as the Department of Education started to roll out this fix, Chris and Cory got an interview. And in one of the most on-brand moments of this whole story, the person chosen to be the face of this so far mostly faceless bureaucracy was a senior official with a spectacularly long title.

DIANE AUER JONES: Diane Auer Jones is my name. And my title is principal deputy undersecretary delegated the duties of undersecretary and assistant secretary for postsecondary education.

MALONE: And towards the end of that interview, there is this kind of unbelievable moment, this thing that you just don't necessarily expect to hear from someone representing a bureaucracy.

TURNER: This is your chance to talk to a couple million people, many of whom are teachers. And I'm curious, what would you say to them now about TEACH Grant?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

JONES: How sorry we are. I mean, obviously, we, want to extend an apology. We've put teachers who didn't deserve this stress, this pressure, this financial burden in a position that is stressful and frightening and confusing. And I can't give them back those years. And I can't take away the gray hairs. And I can't take away the stress. It seems like a small thing to do, to say I'm sorry. But I'm very sorry, and we want to work to fix it and correct it.

MALONE: As of this story, around 7,000 teachers have applied to get their TEACH Grants fixed. So far, the vast majority of those teachers have qualified. They'll find out ironically the same way they found out everything was screwed up to begin with, with a letter in the mail from the Department of Education. Kaitlyn McCollum got hers just before she was leaving on a family vacation. She brought the letter with her in the car. Her husband was driving. Her son was in the backseat.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)

K MCCOLLUM: All right. Here we go. Do you see that word? See where it says congratulations? Dear TEACH Grant recipient, you qualified to have your eligible loans reconverted to TEACH Grants. I like - I don't know whether to cry or laugh or, like - Louie, can you say yay?

LOUIE: Yay.

K MCCOLLUM: Yeah. Woohoo. Woo. Yay. I love your dance moves, buddy.

A MCCOLLUM: You're free, baby.

K MCCOLLUM: I'm so excited.
