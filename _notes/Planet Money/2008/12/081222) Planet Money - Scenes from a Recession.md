The economy is sending surprising signals, not all of them easy to decode. A Brooklyn printing company says business is down, but a certain kind of salesperson still buys big. A California man wonders why his mall's Christmas tree looks so puny. And recycling folks out West say they suffer when consumers put off buying that new TV.

Today on Planet Money:

-- Adam Davidson visits Frank Caracciolo, owner of the Universal Printing Company in Brooklyn, New York. Carcciolo says business is down, but you may be suprised at who's still buying big.

-- Listener Christopher Dael of Riverside County, Calif., says his local mall's tree looks nothing like the ones in years' past. What's up with that? (The 2006 tree is after the jump.

-- Putting off the purchase of a big flat-screen TV? You're not alone. Chana Joffe-Walt of KPLU says the decline in sales is having an unexpected — and unwelcome — effect on recycling.
