Thank you so much. I know will be checking in with you again and safe travels back home. Have a good weekend  in chicken so much with with with Tom corona in his running partner will last in recent other people in New York is this is we’re right in the epicenter of this credit crisis, but we do like to get across the river in the ocean paper cross the ocean in the other ocean from the other oceans and really like it when we get to talk to shoot Ajit desk our he’s our favorite of Australia  Risk analyst author of the lovely book, traders, guns and money we asked him where in the world would we go if we wanted to see the most interesting and powerful impact of this crisis on the country outside of Dallas, put it in the direction of Iceland described as the strangest strangers strangers  People, and it’s not seem to be emerging at the epicenter of the credit crisis. Give me some idea market collapse by Travante reopen. The currency has collapse by by 95. I think that huge huge problem and it actually a relatively attack country is the United States stock market dropped out by 80%  Right absolutely well history I mean Iceland is private is it volcanic rock and three which classify as a developing or in emerging country and then in the 1998 under win amazing and money that difficult to believe that the whole Icelandic GDP the banks actually had deposit of roughly hi GDP  Effective the US one is probably close to one to one whole honey country to grow true banking, and other thing which is to have a low JioSaavn energy at all Cofru Ali minium plant in it really really bad and some headlines come out like Iceland, the tiny dynamo economy became exactly like the US to some degree  And economy driven by money banks, the bank which are known as lunchtime and that’s all they ate the three bags that’s it and they actually wanted to meet one of the banks we want to be the Goldman Sachs of the Arctic because there wasn’t one at the time he wasn’t worth it  Didn’t ambition I guess they’re now the Bear Sterns of the Arctic is Bang Linda, grab the world end at five to Keuka well we are buying all these banks in Europe. We are buying all these banks that England and they were actually financing the lovely Icelandic no anyways it is like the surprise Poswa US completely different way of court. It all came down like I have a cat , second in the law, probably not to use another idea how did blue back from the bank or part of Paso off dick which was sold do European in American banks have now gotten trouble on these investors printed one European adventure Rudolph, the last couple of days $1.6 billion on these packages of lunch notify Diah  Hey what’s gonna happen here but so Innoway what you’re saying is that Iceland is kind of living out the nightmare that the United States was able to pull back from absolutely no in many ways at the US is still not asleep, enjoyed the nightmare of suffering from it and have a place to TIK token Saturday I understand does that if Iceland default on instead if that’s bad for whoever left the money in the first place, what happens to Iceland there’s someone else things I’ve owned parts of Iceland what does it mean well actually it doesn’t mean a lot  Though to do that I think I would like a Kapuk Hachikuji Raya OK so what actually happened is Iceland essentially become a pariah they can’t borrow money and usually what happens is the appointment bankruptcy back to the iPad but they come in do you have to do this bunny Texas  Shit in a very very major way the domestic population and that’s the tragedy tragedy. Yeah we’re in New York and and I still find that unless I’m actually talking to people who work in the finance world in New York and even though we’re the center of this crisis you walk a block from Wall Street and I know you’ll be in New York next week so you’ll will be able to see this firsthand. You just don’t feel you don’t feel  Not there yet on main street. He’s in a place like Iceland or hungry or Korea are people doing it on the street? Is it like the crisis of 1998 where you know thousands of millions of people lost of jobs and politicians were you know up call Cory is it still just a financial know in Iceland as I think what happened to the right day break it Dimitri  Very very worried bridge if they were really worried about money and they deposited bank today with Ronald Bang and also what happen if they were concerned is actually happy food production I have to import all the food Icelandic currency has collapsed about the price of food run on supermarket there worried about the weather today  Food so we need when you make a run on the bank you can look at people say well that’s kind of silly but when you make a run on food that is actually frightening to the wider herd I think that’s right that is exactly right and effectively I think one of the things this state  Common in the world are we talking bad dream league, dream league, remote eventually what happen with the three remote event play true into the real world, in terms of physically and most important job, the ability to borrow money to do very, very physical things. Generally that drive things like the Bility  Bend business investment past the point of no return are they what’s a bond trader today and they were all still see my maybe the USO pull out of it will be a recession, but it won’t be that horrible crisis. Are these other victims were talking about their guess it’s over for them for a while for a long long time what what’s the reminder I think of a case of Iceland there’s a real fear that , they will default because obviously their death that often in US dollars I’d like to USD that this would be more like Argentina that they cannot actually make the payments on a dick but I have to sit down with it at Linda’s. What are we gonna do with me there is a huge line to the lender US does not qualify  That money for that problem about this current crisis is it is not spreading globally to the emerging market real country will be OK I think will have serious problems and I don’t know how I feel and shows you how to carry all the fish so well that was talking to us about Iceland, which magical place our own plant moneys on David Kestenbaum was spending time with it says that he was spending time with a wizard Via Calen wrote it but it is true. It’s been hanging out at Wharton he’s been going to the Busines Boot Camp, courtesy of the school. I don’t know if they just had it with us and them  to so we need to know more. What a special week on Boot Camp on business for journalists. Yeah thanks thanks warden in David Forto did Quebec and show us what you know email telling us about this great wizard guy, Jeremy Siegel he’s a professor of finance, he is called the wizard of Horton, and apparently Mr. Wizard had some pretty strong words for treasury secretary, Henry Harrison , OK so your professor yes what grade do you give Henry Paulsen I give the the plan to be and I give his marketing of the plan an F it was presented in a in a very bad way. It was marketed in a bad way and it was it was the worst possible way to present a plan for rescue to the US Congress F minus yeah, well if I could give enough , I guess I would think of a worst way to come in an imperious way and say this is the way it’s going to be I want 700 billion do with what I want you just incredible and you know as it finally turns out you know they’re moving in a different direction than what they originally planned, which was divided  First step now is the capital infusion or wait for him to go about it well, I think the better way is he should’ve thought through exactly what prices he was going to buy these assets out rather than not knowing question about whether the taxpayer is, I mean, if he buys them alone, a price don’t make a profit to higher price. It is a giveaway to the bank. None of that seem to be tied up before hand, and I think that that that was a pivotal issue that that was not , well advertently that the Fed has more powers to be able to reassure you know my feeling is is that the both of been in the treasury should make some statements about standing behind certain loans now the federal reserve has is Nelson standing behind commercial paper, but they need to extend that to enter bank lending need to extend that to all the loans that are made them at the LIBOR rate, which is stored in your way high now relative to other rates in economy. There’s a lot of things that I think would’ve gone first rather than buying distressed assets from from the banks  And putting our device for a long time and I’ve been bullish and I think that people will buy stocks today will be well rewarded in the future. I will also say to be very violent on the short run if you need money next week next month stay out of the market, but if you can forward to put it away for a few years, will be happy , thank you thanks David for the first meet at the problem with being somebody like Henry pause it is that you’re gonna be critiqued by incredibly smart people like Jeremy Siegel and I think there’s a lot of frustration among economist that they haven’t been consulted more to say when was the day or the week of hearings in Capitol Hill, or very high-level public discussion of this entire issue before they brought the before they block brought the planning and executing, I am sympathetic to  Her that there’s so many smart people are looking at making crisis, physical crisis, really smart people, and what I find is the vast majority of left-wing and right wing all the different spectrums take that they seem to kind of cool here around of you and I I do and I wish that there was a more public discussion among people with Jeremy Siegel another’s. Yeah, I have a test for use market. I have with me right now Erin brother , a question that I’ve gotten several times and I have over here to my left Adam David’s in the Adam I know it’s been a long week but Aaron is going to ask you a question and I want you to answer that question in 60 seconds or less I’m ask Kaitlyn  O’clock right now why does this question count towards the time no Adam what exactly is a right off understand that banks are planning on writing off more money related to real estate they’ve already written off from $700 billion worth and the people are saying right off 1.5 trillion wait what does it mean when they do this for me if they’re going to do more white  Write off or write down is is when a when someone thinks they have something of a certain value and then they realize it’s actually worth less than that so if your business and your own a bunch of copy machines and you thought they were worth 1000 bucks and then you learned that they weren’t very good and they’re only worth $100. You have to write down the $900 difference on your books. The reason that’s such a big topic in the news right now is that is the cause of this crisis, all these banks, and  Had his assets with this toxic waste stuff this mortgage related subprime mortgage related asset if he thought it was worth trillions and are now finding out is worth less promise. We have no idea what it’s worth. That’s the whole reason the US government is stepping in to every bank truly am absolutely true has the basically yes they have to come up with a number so they keep writing it down to the number they think is right and then they often have to write it down again when they realize the number they came up with us too optimistic  Adam Aaron do you need a follow up? What date did that answer your question? Yes one question I would have is yes they’re what does it mean when they say come down bhagas gonna be another you know wave a P short suit so normally what you would do is look so you have a bond in the pond is treating the marketplace in $100 yesterday and now it’s in the marketplace and it’s trading at $90. Do you know the price you know it was 100 yesterday and today it’s $10 less when people are selling your bond again and again have one and other people have others do you know look forward or US government or you know GM or whatever will issue pond militia? A lot of them are the same terms the same  Bills on the same day so if you have one for $100.09 one for $100 I hold onto mine you sell yours to Kaitlyn for $90 that gives me a sense of market price is $90 so I write mine down and Mike internal bucks to sell from  my own reference. OK I thought I had 100 bucks I don’t know I have 90 bucks for the problem with the supreme assets as they are not trading, you’re not Sonia‘s to Kaitlyn she’s not selling hers to Josh nobody selling any information there’s no information about what they’re worth so each bank invents a number and what we’ve seen it is for the same exact plan one bank might see what I think it’s worth $.84 on the dollar and another bank  Freight I think it’s worth $.32 hear about this crisis of confidence in ability of banks to get anyone else to lend the money. This is a big part of it in a one bang let’s say just a pick a name randomly out of all right bank of Conway Conway bank wants to borrow money from Kenny bank and Conway bank. Kenny bank  401(k) limits $1 billion in Kenny banks as well wait a second you wrote those assets down by $.40 to 40% but my hunch is you didn’t write it down enough I don’t trust you I think you’re lying and so I’m not gonna lend you any money, so that’s the incentive basically for your bank to do another write down to get confidence back to make people think that you really mean it when you say you have enough money  That’s in that in addition, richest new information more for closures it’s a prank crisis deepens we’re heading into a recession with the guess there’s gonna be even more foreclosures in so that damages the value of his assets to be another way to write offs or write down. Prices are going to continue well we don’t know what the price is, but it means there is no price or his assets , it means his banks chose an arbitrary value last week that was and now it’s hard for them to justify that in the market I think it’s all worth you know 100% of its original value but they know they can’t get away with that, because regulators and other private actors know people I want to do business with  Your gonna say I don’t believe you gonna do business to the bank after write down the value in a More Credible Way,, Aaron burner of New York City thank you welcome and thank you so much Laura Josh for yet another planet money wonderful week and that you can check it out online npr.org/money I’m Laura Conaway I’m heading for the weekend I’m Adam Davidson I’m heading to
