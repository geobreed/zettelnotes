Inflation went down last month, which turns out to be unnerving instead of good news. That's partly because consumers are keeping their money in their pockets, even with cheaper prices on the shelves. Plus: An expert gives us a tour of one bank's balance sheet.

I’m Adam Davidson and I am Laura Conaway. It was Joe the very famous plumber. You just heard we join today is Thursday, October 16 it’s about 10 to 4 in the p.m. here in New York and give us the planet money indicator/I wanna bring in our buddy Tom corona from tradition angel securities. He is on the front lines of the credit crisis Tom our banks lending to each other yet or the bank bucket. It’s still frozen  Sporadic lending in the very short area of one month we haven’t seen really any three months, six months understand exactly what the guarantees on the banks are yet and I guess they’re just trying to get a grasp on exactly what the plan is on guaranteeing the interbank senior death market, but most of the money for Cak , I’m still refraining from buying any type of bank that in the bank either on a positive note commercial paper for market to have started to trade out with a little bit more liquidity with the CP in corporate name and money from buying limited amounts out to three months so if it if there is some light at the end of the tunnel do you think it’s that the money market and the other investors he has the pump and soffit people haven’t figured it out yet or maybe the problem hasn’t been sold I think it’s a combination of both but I really do think it be fun to Sheldon don’t really understand exactly where the guarantees are and he still are wary and I’m not trusting again today UPS getting a $60 billion capital injection and had lunch and stuff in the paper  the pharmacy investors are healed in a perfect example of this is the treasury bill market the short film by trading with a negative yield in one hour last week and about two weeks ago we had the first pick down tree. The stock market is it hasn’t happened since the Great Depression and is it basically people willing to apply at an asset  get that money back in two weeks three weeks and they’ll except small negative return for the safety of what time corona. Thank you so much. Are you depressed us in a different way every time we talk thank you very much I can’t wait for the phone call to tell you that everything is fixed and it’s time to get back and let’s hope that next week all right thanks Tom corona of tradition Asia securities. Thank you  little man thanks for the bankers needs to borrow some money Tom Feronik will get money through Vons. Basically short term Barnes from either another bank or one of these money market funds and he’s just sitting there not doing anything with Alex Tino in his office light easily create billions of dollars a day huge office hundred percent dictators do you know  this organization or just giving it to the US government so when he was saying that treasury bonds were trading negative normally even if you’re going to lend to the US government 1%, 3% something small people are willing to let US government and lose money, because they feel confident that at least they will get some of the money back. That’s that is a fair that is quality  right to keep it in cash. If you just gonna get negative cash your deposit that Cak guy put it somewhere that’s not cash and our other planet money indicator to Ted’s Brandon talk a lot about which measures how banks are or are not lending tree chowder it’s it it actually got a little better yesterday  and today is better so it’s still about four which is a troubling number very troubling we went that way sparkly one yes currently high fall 6% better so heavy and we want it to fall 80% 75% poor more moving there is another indicator that came out today which is the consumer price index and that is also on that that is also a Salah next bag came out  as inflation measures and everybody thinks that inflation is low that’s good. It was a fabulous anything more for sandwiches cars wonderful day you would think the family yeah that’s the problem is that it on the other side of inflation is deflation worse and deflation hasn’t really happened in this country since again , the question is when it’s just when prices go down day after day down and the reason that seems like well it is a good thing in a very, very limited context, but it’s not actually actual depletion that is not simply prices things becoming worth more fordable, that is an actual monetary problem and what it means is basically everything‘s prices going down high school down the thing that you can as a company the thing that you can sell for five dollars today for four dollars tomorrow so you’re making  and then if you’re making this money you can only pay it workers and they can fix stuff and then and more and you also have an incentive not to invest cause why build a factory for $100 million to make goods that are gonna cost less in the factory I’ll be worth less than 100 right and then if there’s less investments and then also if you can today, so there is really it just turns into a downward spiral very very quickly, so that is why the Alyssa , that’s why everybody there was there where is it proven to be tragically not on target at the wrong thing about the wrong thing I don’t worry about depression and I’m gonna worry about it. I think it’s been for the last couple weeks day. Do you want to scare and depressor Alyssa Smith slightly different wet now it should be put out that the Internet depression the Fed didn’t do all the things , they are on the big kiss. Not gonna worry about the great depression. I’m gonna worry about. I’m getting a lot of this on the block question from Leah home in Portland Oregon. He is in the late 20s. Poor thing I’m too young. A recession I know that there has been , and now I am old enough to be if I could buy them and I have no idea what a recession Lee in my every day life I’m gonna have that brand is gonna be really expensive. Is it mean that to be totally insane does it mean that all the restaurants and bars in my town are going to go under and some of them are going to go under it doesn’t mean you know I think we were all alive in the late 70s we’re all alive , yeah that’s when I graduate that is in my memory if that’s my basic adult time ever gotten no jobs and there was a feeling I’m gonna think I think of that feeling I always have been always will be sick and imagine feeling well and that’s what I remember in 1991 is pressing, feeling that whatever happened in America when young people had a dream and vision  assess that phase of America is over. It’s just miserable slog with a dark future. You have a much more macro view of it. I remember thinking like oh it’s I just thought that was the way it wasn’t you cause I didn’t fully feel as if you’re even really in , but I remember it later in the 90s when we were out of a recession and I would start meeting kids and they’re like 23 and they’re graduating from college and it’s like jumping into the job market and get lots of lots of money and that’s when I realized oh I graduated during the  recession that’s what that was. You know I didn’t really notice the recession recession that I was I’ve lived through in terms of crisis so much I actually felt like I had plenty of money I worked very little and I lived in a really cheap little $200 room in an apartment in San Francisco . It mean you just didn’t have a ton of money but you had a lot of time and I notice now in my neighborhood or families out doing things like ;-) father will pick up games going on. In the parks. There is free fun well listen Rosie view yes for sessions are wonderful. Time with your family cry 16 there’s a thing that I converse , it’s the factors on the market and what they mean is that a fact it doesn’t recession is not black or white it doesn’t mean that every single person is happy during growth in every single person is miserable during session, but I think what it means is that people who and businesses and others things that are just home run successes are gonna do OK Europe, orthopedic surgeon  quite as much money if you’re if you’re just a really really good plumber or whatever you’re gonna do OK if it’s those marginal businesses that are less likely to click I was thinking about this in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, which is right on the border between sort of the yuppie spread south park slope into a working class neighborhood, and just for the last three or four years it’s just felt inevitable that you know what kind of cheap lousy liquor store closes in a fancy snobby wine store, open place the old fashion pizza place closes in the morning  fashionable higher in the pizza place open in evitable that the yuppie spread would take over my neighborhood and just enough for a couple years or restaurant is on the margin if it went a little bit farther than the core safe and feel like actually like what it actually means to her I think it means you know she’s in her 20s doesn’t have a lot of shit ready to job might be harder  than her job because she is like younger and probably senior. She has less experience and to find a job but it will get that even the most pessimistic views we’ve heard from really the darkest darkest market players is it’ll be rough for a year or year and a half right but it’ll be like what we would all three of us have left  yet because it happened in such a spectacular fashion this way so to one thing that marks, the recession actually tell you what it is two consecutive quarters meaning 64 months negative economic growth different people have different definitions, different countries of different definitions, but one thing that seems pretty consistent is it is a recession and people spend less money and we talk to one of our favorite  Chicago graduate school of business are you Mike remember he had a different take on the economic crisis you posited a theory when you said you didn’t have enough data to prove it at that time, but your theory was it what might be happening now is not entirely a financial Wall Street credit crisis, but actually more of a standard issue by elimination of consumer spending the 350 American consumer it is given up on buying and that is adding to the financial crisis. I think you you can update that Siri what’s an actual fast right so I think I can I want to be clear from the beginning that it is hard to argue that the consumer is hurting for reasons that have nothing to do with the financial crisis obviously since about August of last year‘s been a lot harder to get a mortgage is been hard to get home  credit so those things could be contributing to the drop in consumption at the point that I wanted to reiterate it’s just that alcohol consumption or just how much people are buying is one of the most important, economic indicators of recession and the news that came out yesterday that retail sales United States for the month of September we’re down 1.2% from August is very strong evidence that the health of deduction is dropping rapidly and it’s probably a big reason for the stock market reaction for Yesterday  like a lot can you just help me understand that yeah so that the month on month came in one month retail sales dropped by 1.2% specter consumption makes up 70% of GDP to the total output of the economy 70% of that is win can we just do it quick definition  all the time and it’s the size of the economy, but when the world is basically the output of goods and services in the economy, so it’s basically made up of four main component government spending consumption you what you and I by what business is in debt, and then net export  export minus what we import so every time I buy a sandwich or a computer or go for a flight or pay for a doctors visit that’s a Dengan Jaya VPSs, adding money exactly and ultimately the money that you spend is that his money somebody else is hurting him a thing  as kind, a measure of how our standard of living is going off because it’s a measure of how much income we’re making based on what other people are buying and that number that represents the health or the size of the US economy the biggest chunk of that number by a long shot is consumer spend  exact exact about 70% and that’s not every country right that’s the US is higher than other country. I think it is higher than other countries but every country I think the primary component would be I think we’re on the higher end of that but nothing reflected by the fact that part of the reason world economy is getting very worried because the US consumer is the ultimate buyer of a lot of good from all of across the whole world, though it’s not just that the consumer affects you  the world economy but I think 1.2% how much is that when was the last time we drop 1.2%, so oh I don’t know that exact number but just to put it in perspective when we talk about GDP growth we talk about how much did the economy grow and there were talking about a change from 2% positive growth to -1%  That’s a major recession so if you want to put 1.2% into that perspective is consumption, followed by 1.2% for the quarter or add an annualized rate so if that’s a huge change in GDP that can definitely take us from you know a moderate recession  in your opinion we I I don’t want it they made you know what the qualification a major versus minor, but I won’t be surprised if the third quarter GDP numbers come out and show in a pretty sharp and I don’t wanna make it but I think it’s safe to say that there’s drop in retail therapy for September is the last month of the third quarter, and taken to gather the evidence from July August, September suggested  for the third-quarter which would’ve caught definitely a recession per territory and if it continues a lot of time does severe recession it’s not so much does 1/4 draw but then the length of how long it lasts I need a bad number because it’s gonna happen now I’m back on inventory indefinite on capital those are also part of GDP until you see that  so that’s the ripple effect I don’t go to the store and buy a computer I actually truthfully last week I was going to upgrade my computer and buy a new one and I decided not to and stick with my old one even though it’s kind of slow and broken, is your fault, Adam is my father  that’s what we’re talking about people making decisions like that I was in PC Richards, which is a big electronics store on Sunday and normally Columbus Day weekend Sunday I mean you couldn’t move through that store empty just nothing is moving so so 1.2% it sounds like not much but it is something you can feel and see right definitely humor in someway through the whole crisis may have been our last hope , I even though their housing prices are going down they can’t access credit or a second mortgage I think but we’re starting at the avenues now that they are not my thing I am not worried can you can you help me understand something I’m getting on the block which is  saying hey, we’re being told we’re living beyond army and we need to stop spending money and sake and then somebody like you comes along is hold on everybody you got to get out there and spend money is the last hope for the global economy well, I’m on the clear I’m not saying I think people should I don’t know if they should all I’m saying is mechanically if people start saving money economy is going to go in  short run of the quite bad for the clear about something there is no doubt that from 2001 2006 a lot of my research shows that people were getting term on their mortgages on their home equity line of credit that work historically good meeting they were able to borrow a lot of money  etc. there isn’t yet to the academic research that I think convincingly demonstrates that that lead to higher consumption, but it probably did. I think we should if I can easily take out a home equity loan, and I can get an outrageously low interest rate on my house. I might use that money to redo my kitchen or buy a TV  so I agree with what you’re reading on your blog that we’re naturally in for a correction in consumption we simply were probably living beyond our mean put it the question is can we smooth it on the down on the on the way down that’s really the question do we want it all just crash or do we want to try to move it in someway, and I think that is partially the purpose of the politician  they’re trying to think of ways you know we need to adjust our consumption level. How do we do so in a way that doesn’t and that’s basically the shop time do we do the adjustment in a few months in a few years right? For example, one is one of the reasons they justify giving out rebates  sending checks out hacker is to try to get people to buy a little more than the other white wood so that you kind of fluid that you cut back a little bit more than a little next month rather than just completely not buying anything this month have you done anything in your home to you cutting back on spending are you do you do you know we just had a baby in August so I have your in July I don’t even know if you had that that time with a three month old baby I don’t even know if we  I think we have cut back you’re there but it happens when all you’re doing is going to bed every night at 10 PM to view exhausted but your diaper my diaper purchases are still pretty hot. Thanks to Oma Sisi and his new family for at least easing the drop in consumer spending so you know is what I was wondering this week about that you were hit with  her before it leverage equity and all this planned what are the words of balance sheet really no what about she is so caught up a professor at Columbia University press the bottom and a he is an expert as an expert yeah and I and I said what is OK back all right, so what are you doing , OK look like a follow it legal to have only 100 and old equity of 100. OK OK start a bank stop right there because now we’re getting into into into into the besides that correct double ledger account double ledger, right OK so when I saw it when you and I we have $100 that goes on both sides OK so basically right now I haven’t left the money. I’ll give it to Dhika , OK let’s just take this trip open. The open branches raise $900 in deposit from customer OK OK instantaneously thing like cash 1000 of 900 which is the money we owe to all the red and the owners equity which is our money which is 100 OK OK  vike’s getting the closet OK let’s say we keep $100 for money just in case you want to take the money out red nine $900 lol OK to find Jog 22 corporation wish need money OK then cash on my balance sheet of the appetite, cash hundred and I have an asset like a lunatic of 900 I said OK no change on my liability state liabilities of 900 people and have owners equity offer of 100. OK our banker think about what is 900 I have liabilities of 901 equity of 100  leverage. Hi Siri my own money address as the owner of the bank I want to put in $900 of somebody else’s money outside of money money in something to mourn leveled a bank so obviously that that example in our in our Nlsub theoretical example, and most things obviously are very different than that and that they have lots lots more money and they have lots in the the things they do with it , but basically he said you know I asked him like is this is it is it basically basically and then let me just go to download the app and then you can do that I just wait, so what are you doing right now he can care of it is a full report, but the full report a new report for Morgan Stanley  quarterly report on October 9 as part of the better that you can get Puspa this quarter and it in as of August 31, 2008 OK so you have the Morgan Stanley only had half of $987 billion OK $987 billion loan to people or invested in things  invested in various right OK enter how is that broken down to the Avenue that nine $87 billion went where did where is it? Where did it have financial instrument owned a fair value 371 billion a fish corporate another deck is 118 by the people I want to buy Morgan punishment money out. Maybe they have lent out not as a bang but  a death and government securities other foreign government obligations for the financial in Tubun Satria Jalan, 371 billion to the third and it’s financials and that includes corporate bonds as well as government debt debt. They bought bought them for Curity some heroin probably bottle copper that vegan Sendy  flashlight agreement that security agreement to reset 179 billion views from a view what they call problematic as it will fall under the category of security borrowed of 241 billion but the other two big things around billion everything else would like to know :-) really so basically so basically at 300 billion in a straight ahead bonds in a cup in pounds $120 billion in call Ashley is agreement and these are things that are art that even finance professors like you have to serve like try to figure out with that  that he was going into that video application does Petaluma is 400 billion that’s with a message in the in the calculator less financing it appears to be know what we can do is look at the reliability rack numbers on the liability Faye yes to Billy dollars off $15 billion of cable to customer  money way over to Canada maybe put it no I meant but at the end 400 is that could’ve already that’s already down and he does actually work more. I get this question from people on the block they want to say can you show me were there I can see you show me how to see if my bank is soft and it looks like here you could go and look at the balance sheet  online for your bank right in what you’re trying to do is figure out what kind of cancer that I think that’s one of the things I keep saying basically from this whole crisis how much how much you have to learn how exciting to learn it it’s not over living in in the crews are very inside and stuff that’s available  for free on the Internet but that has been around us. Our whole lives really wanted to but but it’s him I find it I’m just that tired of it the intellect truth. Part of my brain started that wasn’t it up you have to figure out what the derivatives of mortgage back securities , yeah anyways that that is planet money for today October 16. I just want to say wow we have been reporting this detail close 400 points up today.
