People still need a vacation time with their face break from their work. Anybody perform is a vacation hi welcome to NPR‘s planet money I’m Laura Conaway today is Wednesday, October 15. It’s about 4:42 PM here in New York Adam Davidson my colleague is hanging out in Brooklyn. He’s got some numbers for Adam what are the planet money indicator‘s And care about is the Dow normally when you’re trying to ignore it down a lot today 733.8% in any normal time in the world that would be unbelievable. Headline shocking news spread which is the measure of how the credit markets are doing fine to the system ugly and it went up  4.3 the 10th of one percent off from yesterday not not the worst news but we really want to see that number coming way way way down we want that under one hand going off went down a little bit a couple days ago and going up today. I talk to your buddy will Aston Reese today favorite money market enter bank  in the front line that money from bank to bank he said that he’s not moving anything except treasury bills that people are not willing to lend anything safe as possible so that people are actually afraid that if they bought into a security that they couldn’t sell it you don’t want to be the first one the US are hoping is that one’s this plan that was a noun yesterday is fully understood  Confidence money with that moving no thank wants to be the first one to jump in. No they’re like penguins at the edge of the water the other day that will probably be a trickle a drop out of Davidson. Thank you will see you tomorrow. Thank you Laura so that was my buddy Adam Davidson. Meanwhile we’re waiting for tonight‘s presidential debate. John McCain and Barack Obama are expected to spend a lot of time talking about the economy and we’re going to take a look at their plans in just a minute first I wanna get to the sky Patrick Janel Adam this week, log something saying if you’re having trouble getting credit get in touch with us we want to know what a responder, Patrick Jenelle Patrick lives in Los Angeles, and he recently got it  Apprised of his American Express statement. Patrick says he thought he was doing all right he’s paying on time but he says American Express just lowered his credit limit by $500 right out of the blue. I did call the customer service because I was concerned and I would, for that it wouldn’t be lower to  You and and after speaking with advisor and basically the supervisor said that American Express has been on enrich management and based on on my credit score decided to lower a minute and I said you know well I just never happened to me before I know that there a few more flags in line my credit score but I guess I didn’t think it  Boring than lowering my ass American Express and if they were, they weren’t able to if they were able to rain in any credit they were getting out in any small places. It sounded like that, but they were taken care of and then, moreover, the woman told me that they’re actually  Similar action with a heart builders two with even if it wasn’t like yours was was the worst and therefore it went out it was yours. She did mention that was fine and other people they were they were taking so you see global credit crunch here yeah yeah definitely I wasn’t really expecting to see very much and I actually have taken the attitude for while that you know I mean I have personal finances that I need to deal with but I really didn’t have anything , in the past for as a current credit, and now I didn’t really really fat to the global economy, and even the national telling me a relief eight thing and things that I really do feel like I’m affected that was listener Patrick Janelle filling us in on his personal brush with the credit crunch know it’s too little bit of politics last week planet money reporter, Dan Costello talk to Richard Green read is a professor of real estate in economics two things that have been going together a lot lately and I’m not very happy with green teachers at the University of Southern California and he’s backing. Senator Barack Obama green has got some issues McKinsey  Plan for buying up mortgages and saving the economy. The idea is that the treasury with five mortgage is directly from lenders at their paper value so if you had a subprime mortgage that was originated with $100,000 balance, and then refinance the borrower into something more favorable based on the current value of the house , we doing is injecting money back into the people who invented mortgages supposed to add a homebuyer to Oma so what you’re saying is that the money would go to investors rather not necessarily to main street but it would go to people that on the loan or go to people that on the security  my understanding is it would be largely go to people who are on the mortgage is right now and Wood, and under the plan as you understand it with the federal government the pain below market value with current market value, suppose a a lender and an lender mean a lot of things  The investor in the mortgage security with a face value of $100 and we don’t know what that’s worth right now as I understand and so if that doesn’t make that investor hole or that bad that we have is to prepare for Merrill Lynch had a fire sale to go right where they sold security  I am reasonably sure is it in existential sense more than $.22 the dollar value so the right number the economically correct number is somewhere in between but we don’t know what that in 22 and $.20 in a dollar today lotta room right exactly puzzle is if they’re giving the investor a dollar against what is harmless from  Eight because we don’t know what the differences between the real value would be something for it and so do you think at the end of the day this approach is a smart approach right now or are there other approaches that you think would be well I don’t like it I mean I don’t like it because what if basically does is it allows you responsible under skin all their money back and then explain it to us  is because they are offering paid value for the mortgages, a lender subprime mortgage and that’s the one that lender be nobody you’ve ever heard of who bought surety provided the capital for making his mortgages that we should’ve known could never be been paid back we’re saying we’re gonna let you off the hook you all your money back in action, so what does that means just to bring it back to the original what does that mean so if the government takes 300 6 101.5 billion in $1 trillion and in pays off the mortgage still , what does it mean to the average homeowner who is stressed or does that mean they’re fine it’s all sealed up depends on the next step if it means for the plan is that they would also originate new mortgages for trouble or I guess I said for all at the value of their house or something related to the value of their house at a lower interest-rate and rewrite them a new 30 year loan right now OK so  if you have a subprime loan but we don’t really know what the value of that has us are trying to figure out what is the right amount for the mortgage to pay is an issue is who have loans on time equity in their houses already no benefit from now  What is the what about the people who are paying the morning to see if you find out the government is starting to pay off more it won’t that Fania is going to do. It says the taxpayers are going to have to transfer money to one with this means is the taxpayer who has equity in his house, who has been responsible he’s going to be transferring money directly to two types of agent you’re going to be transferring money to make the loan and they’re going to be transferring money to borrowers who are in trouble  Job losses we have seen the right ways that none of us but some of the followers were irresponsible and they were people never had any payment transfer from responsible people to investors to lenders and to borrowers from him not him so responsible Windu has practice come back with Marc come back  Here because lamp off the mortgages in and in and in what we heard about the Paulson plan is that by toxic debt thanks and perhaps they would pay a little bit more than the airport now Bradley paid a little bit less but yes, the market came back and there’s a possibility and that Mosel that they would  if it was really smart good wonderful small profit this plan plan to go out through the government to do that that’s right that was Richard breed of US citizen center speaking with Dan Costello today I went looking for someone to talk about Senator Obama’s plan I found Diana Roth of the Hudson  Rock economist specializing in employment and she is she says Obama‘s economic description and they are all on this point would text too much in cost too much history, leader of the fan and people making 250,000 or more even though he’s a job economy, small businesses who reached that threshold 250,000 would be to get rid of his pack  or making 250,000 or more he has not done take it off the tax for the oil company if he wants to purchase title company oil going down drop the tax tax so when you say he has not taken the tax off, I gather that you think it would be good for the economy to go ahead and reduce taxes on businesses  2011 unless something is done right now the top five stop it going up to 79.6 2011 what happens to the economy if if taxes go up in the franc well 00 academic studies show that increasing taxes results to the left of the other  Product so if you raise taxes on cell that Obama supposed to $3000 in for tax credit for jobs created over the net yes it’s a small does the story I think it’s most the end to if they have that 100 and then they create one more job then they get a $3000 credit  Like that what do you say hi somebody to make it 101 quit bringing it down to 100 what happened not on the way to work they have one of the wage workers minimum wage they get the $3000 tax credit what happened to how do they count the Senate Obama  Proposed counting nightmare with $3000 credit but yet the income tax on employees the opposite effect call Rick Yankee that was an interesting thing. Also another interesting job Italian Donna this is the thing where he say will invest in roads and bridges and schools in summer by way of getting jobs  Because you’re going to build a road to take the month do you have to meet out to get the property right same thing that you can start right now they want it takes a month, so what do you see in this time of a cute crisis in this time of response, or some kind of help needing to happen right away what do you see in Obama‘s plans if anything for immediate release , I don’t really see anything we need it relief I can what would be an easy release would be today that he’s not going to raise taxes if he is trying to do that he’s going to spend a federal money, fulfill his promise reduction, which is really welcome so when you say that Obama intends to hold the line or stick to the plan of having taxes go up on businesses in the $200,000 range you’re talking about something that wouldn’t happen until 2011 you say right  Going up currently as scheduled by Congress but with a new president Congress to pass these things any time and it’s not fair to say through web. What if you were elected president Jeremy he could move the Pisces Texas in 2090 somethings that he said that he said would help with that , he wants to keep that a 250,000 to the end of June 9 that was scheduled to expire at the end of this year that was that and that would be helpful because it would help opposite create job investing more equipment. he has a plan for $60 billion to give a rebate , the stimulus check had in a bad June when those check for mailed out that that $60 billion and people might save it to health economy that much it was a Dengan Jews but now right after that economy is worth it but how does an economist such as her self find anyone to record well, it is it is difficult, but I think that given  Given the choices that they’re offering the country right now I’m in favor of more individual choice the government control if you wanted me to understand any one thing if you want to listeners understand any one thing about the Obama say that Senator Obama, it’s impossible Obama make all the sending program if he’s planning on making if you go through his website and get a text that 95% of America  And raise taxes on those making over $250,000 a year which sucked up the whole thing doesn’t add up and I’ll be interested to hear from you. Is that going to be a bus expansion of government programs government authority and is that that was Diana for Scott Ross to challenge for you Obama supporters out there you could have your say answer that challenge on our blog if you like we are at npr.org/moneyordropus an email and npr.org. I’m Laura Conaway that’s another damn planet money .
