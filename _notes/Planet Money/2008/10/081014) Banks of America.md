Federal officials today announced they were using the $700 billion bailout to buy shares in banks. The idea is to get money into them quickly so they can start lending money again. It's a big idea — and a smart one, many economists say — but the devil is in the details. We hear one of the earliest objections.

This message comes from NPR sponsor KPMG revolutionize your enterprise with a yacht KPMG can help you harness the power of AI to unlock its potential and deliver Grove Morris read done kpmg.us/NPR today I am announcing purchase equity stakes in a white variety of banks and thrift government owning a stake in any private US company is objectionable to most Americans he included I am welcome to NPR‘s planet money I’m in Adam Davidson that I am Laura Conaway today’s Tuesday, October 14. It’s about 4:32 PM Adam what’s going on out there well we just heard treasury sick day Henry Paulson make today’s major announcement as we have reported here many times Tata the American taxpayers are now going to be buying into banks  to be buying shares whether we want to or not and does the market like it well to the Dow seem to like it the stock market seem to like it, and then they seemed to not like it quite as much of that went way up, and then it fell down  The credit markets are not impressed as of yet as you know, we here at planet money I guess today we are officially instituting the planet money indicator before but we’re calling them. The Ted spread which we talked about a lot. It is still above four huge numbers it’s at 436 pieces .7 4.36 that is down a little. It went down about 4 1/2% from yesterday but it’s still way way way in the stratosphere compared to historic norms  Not doing terribly well. LIBOR also remains high in the eyes very low which is bad remember treasury bonds are low three months are yielding 0.12 yesterday 0.11 but even last week when things are crazy bad they were 0.67 switch Wallen with treasury bonds to lower it is the worst things are with head spread the higher. It is the worst things are and both of them are in the worst things are area , but another way to find out what’s going on is to call the front lines of the credit crisis and we called her favorite pet money. Trader will Aston Reese lowing blonde locks radio box of tradition A.CHAL securities in New York. He says it too much into the bad news today because people are trying to figure out what this plan. Yes, there’s a lot of noise that had to be sorted through  Till people really not gonna be a lot of food in one of the freezer that you know we have it no nothing and you’re just there just not any money moving to your past no not at all and you got to keep in mind out of this Laura is that it’s one thing  in the government to say these measures of freedom actually have turned my bro this is a Credit card so again it’s 163 OK you’re free to invested Bang Forto Indah bank robber thing for that money to actually be there to be enter so I’m picturing you’ve got clients there’s all sorts of money market fund for Bang to have teams of lawyers in accountant. Willing to Aldi‘s plan. Trying to figure out what’s going on with manager before they actually put the hope. Is it possible that tomorrow or the next day, the conclusion will be paid it is out , we’re gonna start lending I don’t think it’s gone. I think it’s gonna be more like slowly opening if and when it occurs and I’m not saying I am Reni Barry Acong that’s assuming that the plan achieved a scenario even if it’s still just a trip it’s going to start , so it has like no daylight yet for trader will ask the lease not yet for him we wanted to figure out for ourselves. What is in this big plan we wanted to do what he’s doing we wanted to figure out what’s going on in this plan that the there’s this big idea of making a capital injection, a stock injection, where  is saying the government gives money to bank and it’s very different how to bail out was originally sold original Paulson plan even the modified plan of the senate and the house payment has the original idea was to use at $700 billion to buy it bothers bad mortgages another toxic ass ass now at least a chunk of this money is going directly to sort of semi nationalize. The bags just got Christopher. Carol is a professor  at Johns Hopkins. He says he thinks that the stock injection is a good idea and he says return to court Christopher if anything today Tuesday, October 14 we finally figured it out solve the problem of fever is broken and we are on the path going to end up being OK and what broke the fever is this announcement this morning that the government is going to buy shares and banks that’s right I think that coming up with a credible plan that will actually a drastic problem which was the bank  Short on capital instead of addressing what looked like a problem, but wasn’t really at the root of everything. You were one of the majority of economist who wanted this to happen even before even before it was part of the plan can you explain why you wanted this to happen and why you wasn’t to what  Well if it gets to me, or I think anybody else how toxic asset would really do anything to fix the problems that we were in and it looks like it might be a terrible deal for the taxpayer problem and is a rip off that’s not really a plan, but the real problem was that the banks were short on money short on capital  of people infirm and us so you need to get the capital directly into the bank so I’m not sure if you wanted to stock injection plan for the beginning, so did majority of witches and just quickly lay that out in in the what what is a stock injection will it’s a plan basically where the government comes to the bank that’s in trouble and says oh here’s the deal. Are you need money we have money we’re going to get something in exchange rate we’re gonna get an ownership stake bank, and we’re gonna sit on your back and kill you pay us off and that gives you the incentive  to do a good job and that make some money off and get back to your normal business that’s a lot better than just going to the bank and things you have for some nasty stuff that you would like us to overpay you or just dump it on it business when the plan first came forward in the idea was to buy up the toxic waste of the banks  Number $700 million was attached to it and they said well this is this is what we think will do it right now down to treasury having easy access to 350 billion do you think that’s enough money to do this to make it work and not be they are trying to plan a purge  Private investors into getting on the game in fact, what does the government is doing is actually quite similar to what Warren Buffett Goldman, and that’s a reassuring thing I can be reached anything to all Tech bears out there, because I Warren Buffett was looking to make some money from his death  And hope taxpayer Michael ignore what the president says. Ignore what the treasury secretary the picture of and see if warren Buffett is for it then that shows it’s probably have much credibility more but warren Buffett probably and that’s a basic idea right now what we owe on his shares and banks  is better with the toxic assets. We own the thing that nobody on earth wants right now there are a variety of ways where you could conceivably increasing in value and us getting money back, but it seems to me that most people look at it we’re gonna lose money because plan is structured around the idea of making , a bag tractive to try to lure in private investors as well and in the private investors like Warren Buffett are only gonna know the private investors island. Thank you to Christopher Carroll of Johns Hopkins. We put a link to his blog on our site npr.org/money did I just say Adam that every time I hear stock injection or capital in Jackson I think of  a picture that’s kind of what it is actually that’s a really good point because like Uma Thurman and the banking system was dead, and the government came along with a massive hypodermic needle, shoved it in the chest and pumped it. We’re still in that moment in the movie, but we don’t quite know if it worked the banking system has not jumped up and gassed itself . Yeah Professor Carol received kind of optimistic about it but then we talk to this other guy and you’ll catch up with the University of Chicago graduate school business in devil hanging out in the details and I certainly would be in the list. I need to be capitalized this plan definitely going to do that , I believe are correct there’s no word from a dividend payment you’re saying is if there’s no limit on how much they can yeah I dividend cut through the Georgia people aren’t as familiar a dividend basically means I wanna stock and once a quarter or twice a year whatever you get some money as a payment, the company is sharing their profits with the people who only come yes  Paid all the thing yet Farro and so you would you would like to see a limit on what but by having an uncapped dividend a banker takes a $10 billion from the US government from us from the taxpayer and after getting a little bit healthier basically give that $10 billion to the owners of the band  Quebec going in is that they have to talk to the government, but after that, there’s no provision on paying out additional money to the current year holders by principle of maximizing the remain in the bank, because if they don’t their ability to be limited the government you and I and C mean  Why would a bank wants to be recapping why would they go? If so, I am feeling my blood boil well presume that they were gonna be really sharp restrictions anything like that but that doesn’t we’re gonna pay a lot of attention and Nl when you get back from your trip to Europe I’d love to check in with you on that cause I’m gonna make that a planet money by Ari , another way that you can return money to do and that is that you didn’t like that the second second I understand correctly are a little bit more onerous. They can only do it in keeping with the pattern I’m gonna catch up there I just want to explain repurchasing mean so let’s say I have a car company and I’ve thousand shares in my company out there  at $100 so I have $100,000 in capital what I could use if I make a llama and I have cash in the bank because I could buy 500 shares from the public and basically repatriated back to my company and that effectively raises the that’s a benefit to the existing shareholders  Value goes up because it diminishes the number of outstanding shares his work more with Paul so either get the money then or you get a claim from people and so that’s another thing they can take the billions of dollars the US taxpayers gives them and give it just directly get it, sent to the power to their shareholders, the other way, if they could take that money and use it to buy stock, and then the other stock basically received a free gift from the taxpayer buy by having their what they hold  Basically way that the government money instead of going in to build up the Richard Barry at the bank get diverted supposed to be about as majority people who are you there is not on this deal at all. This plan at all if you feel like with his flaws it’s still better than not having him  Know about but look I think Creighton and they had to try to re-Y today but if you got it, Bang got his money Halle paid money out no one last thing we did talk to Winata today he said all right do you thinks this is we’re turning the corner. Things are gonna start improving. What do you think  The alternative he disaster so we’re certainly now we’re gonna have to see if they don’t actually re-Y for Bang turn the corner need more than 125 billion they’re gonna have to go out on that happen then we’re gonna be back in trouble week down the wind so glad today was going to be the first podcast. It was gonna be positive will be the first time since  Were actually have lots of good news to report. It kinda lost about that. Yeah well you should feel quieter than your cash app Chicago Avenue down to earth with a little bit of pessimism Okasha play money listers we just wanna tell you you’re gonna keep digging into the details of his plan we just wanna make sure it’s clear to us and everybody else has the government is going to spend that money and what exactly Americans are going to get out of it be worth getting a broader view at and how the US government is changing so we sat down with autonomous Brad Setser he’s with the counseling farmer  Nation. He talk with me and Alex Bloomberg, in a story that also airs on this American Birdman from selling for net spend that money on stuff helicopters search nowhere with the passage of the Baylor. It’s gonna be doing something entirely different it’s gonna be buying a mortgage rate of assets from banks that’s not all just this week and I said start letting the money directly to individual company  Predecessor is an economist, and he was Adam Davidson. United States started acting like something completely different. Then the government is starting to act like a bank. It is borrowing money by selling his knees and winding to the banking system, lending to big players in so instead of borrowing money, and then putting a bridge thing, you know , it is borrowing money and then giving it to a company as a loan that will be paid back or some thing like that’s the big change and then in addition to doing all that there is the 700 billion it’s going to be used to buy assets that are harder to value and harder to sell in and that it is acting like an asshole  But it’s not acting completely like a bag completely like a bank you’ll be trying to drive the hottest part of August, we can make the most money do that because making the most possible money means in affect find these assets at the lowest prices possible the problem is if you drive to heart of the bargain you doing this is a pure financial bad time to kill  Lowest possible price was acting like a really badly wanna look like yes but it’s doing so forth. Their bus Ray Ray Ray is in this position is what I mean you are shot are used to work on emerging economies. This is what happens when you have a really bad crisis. This is what happens when the bank , so it’s just that you this is happened before just hasn’t happened to the US before exactly where has it happened Indonesia Thailand, Argentina, Russia, and that surprisingly it’s generally not good for any political system. It’s not so I just don’t know how to feel should we be very upset that you’re doing this or should we be upset that the situation require them to do it the glad that they’re doing I think you should be upset that the situation got to this point, but glad that there is an actor name of US government  That is still in a position to do that. The US government still has the ability to borrow it because it was the Bility to borrow it can provide work for the thank you system, and the broader financial system, and prevent what otherwise could be is in a catastrophic run because other countries US government is right now, and borrow money essentially for free , which is the reveal that’s exact opposite of generally what happens with another Pisces either they have to pay exorbitant interest rates tomorrow in their own currency or they can only borrow someone else’s currency, so is there a limit to how much money the US government can borrow like if they have to buy another month in  After that, can we do it possibly Zairian here there is because the more anxiety and fear there is the more money is leaving the banking system leaving money markets in the more money is going into treasury bonds, so it the more beautiful everybody else’s the easier it is for the US government borrow. Another word people are saying I don’t want to put my money in stocks that punching her in Bonsall companies that make  Business or in any country that doesn’t happen to have the most powerful economy on earth I want my money in the one sec please this is different from a typical business. What screws things up that was economist Brad sensor with Alex Blumberg and me for this American life on planet money and that’s a wrap for planet money today you can find us online all the time I didn’t pr.org/money I’m Laura Conaway and I’m Adam Davidson thank you for listening
