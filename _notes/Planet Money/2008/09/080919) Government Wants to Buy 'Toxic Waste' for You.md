The U.S. Treasury Department and members of Congress are considering a $1 trillion plan to buy up bad assets on Wall Street. Economist Raghu Rajan says that looks like a move made in panic to him. He blames election-year politics, and proposes a way for Wall Street to save itself.

This is our fifth emergency crisis week podcast of this very tumultuous week today is September 19 this week we’re giving the time because things change so quickly you need to know when we record these conversations this is at 11:39 AM Eastern time I am very very happy that Ragu Rajan is joining us Raghu hello hi hi I have a regression was the chief economist at the international monetary fund he’s now a professor at the graduate school business at the university of Chicago and he’s gonna walk us through a lot of the finer points of this crisis and he’s gonna answer. A lot of your questions were also joined of course by Laura Conaway hi Laura good morning so where do you want to just start with a N asking some of our listeners questions, well yeah the big one that’s coming through and this one’s actually coming from the listeners. I got it today in an edit meeting with people in NPR everybody wants to know where is the new bail out money coming from this money they’re saying trillion dollars now to do this kind of super bail out and buy out lots of bad ass that’s who’s money is that where is that money coming from ? We don’t know what the phone with this be allowed Winnipeg will it be a buyout of assets and the monies coming from your pocket it’s the exact money which is going to be invested, and hopefully it will not be invested up to pay a price, and the government will hope that eventually  Will make some money off if your pocket and it could be wasted so we are about to make an involuntary by we I mean the taxpayer and involuntary investment in Wall Street a big one from all towns yes and when you say you hope her money will get invested, but not it to higher price I mean not it to higher risk  From the little bit and complain to far end of the weekend will tell us more. The government is going to buy the proposals one is where the government find some of the toxic waste on bank balance, and the question dad will be at what price will it by because there is no market will be cash  Overpay is relative to the fundamental value of that difference is a gift from the taxpayers to Wall Street winter for the pool going to be Basich and overtime recovery in value. Well the government has made some money on behalf of the taxpayers for the real question is what price will it get  Chicken alternative is for the government to buy directly Ridin by the cold and evacuate the question. What price does it get the shares that and in the long run again do this for me to read to be well today we’ve been talking an awful lot here at planet money about how people bought and sold things if they don’t know what they’re worth net in a lot of kisses, they take your actually worth less so it seems to me that if if not, it is worth less and the government buys it for anything it’s already paid more than it was worth  Issue assets currently there is no market nobody fine nobody said it right give me some value right and if you think the market value are you yeah because the new market market value is exactly 0 yeah for anybody being overpay right the other view is fine to the stop. They are certainly will , you and the government can come in because it made popular and you know it can buy it. Create the support price and value that support price is the air is not going to be over Bang and Louis know. Eventually the government will make money with me – markets recover send Henry Paulson poly yeah, sorry about that. That’s actually my phone and I apologize I turn it off , that’s our boss calling but what will leave that Asagoe Karpas back later Raghu I’m curious about so the where is the debate is in your profession among economists is your sense that pretty much everyone agrees this is a good idea we have to do it or is there is it fairly hotly debated right now , but the same as this something has to be done, but I would say many people a Betty queasy at the idea of government in trading markets, and actually flying up after they’re setting up right when will impact the market is unwilling to set a price in in for the reasons, but Laura mentioned a Betty worry  About getting the wrong price and therefore offering turn off money to people who made the biggest mistake in the second is the concern that maybe the wrong way to calling in to be the problem all you’ve done with the market for a little while a lot of speculators unload that bad acid onto the government and then once the government grant out of money because you need a pretty deep pocket in the truck  is required then be falling prices resumes and all you’ve done is ways to text Damon. There are hedge fund, investors, and other investors who are thinking oh boy, this is a huge opportunity. You can make a fortune off the United States government really matters. How do you write? Do you go directly to the pharmacy? I’m going to buy your ratchet from you or do you say I’m gonna find an open market if you want  on the open market Will Ferrell lots of potential speaker station in order to unload it on you, so it sounds like what you’re describing is a situation where is the US government goes in a little bit here they could really get skunked. We kind of got to go in all the way quite possibly exactly 8 AM , how much are you willing to go in and at what point are you gonna stop and say we just can’t do it and make the analogy to what is called the revolution trust corporation by the government to take over the assets of field operations in the 1980s between that proposal Portuguese  Associations because they’ve gone bad and the government just had to figure out how to sell leave at slowly overtime and quite effectively if you have to buy it and then the question is how much do by Hulu buy from where you buy it and I and I don’t know with no at the end of this week and what do you see smart ways for the government to do this , I mean my own personal view is that the real problem we have a need a speaker shortage of gas in the real quick and you should be pondering it. How do you recap like you financial firms in sure Tora sorry I’m so sorry Ellen keeps calling me. I think I just want to take over the podcast. Yeah sure OK yeah I think the real problem with the lack of capital and what we need to figure out is weird of Rika? lysing  Industry it’s important for the note because when the banking system is sort of cab to what they gonna do is try and bring the kind of pink launch of the opera credit card, all that would be cool Shadowmoss, that the credit contraction Beb to take place every household and their bike.  Don’t try and be careful about. When is the government going to recap find you shareholders, sovereign wealth, fund, secure in their private equity funds to put a captain if you want to put up more captain no, I would say beat the government. The last thing we should try when we tried everything else it hasn’t worked and that’s the first thing we try again because of all the things you need to be seem to be doing some things lots of politicians, jumping on that’s why we doing it as the first thing  That we tried getting money of capital a little bit but we haven’t course the banks to do it meaning other countries like China, China Korea Petit pony up a little more because if you’ve got a fragile bank if you put more capital H capital assets and I will call Robert buying  Decide that they want to buy the bath at Mika. I will have a pop it offensive that we are police guys to stop and give it back like you stop the beach of capital from a second I would say I’m gonna give you one more shit off the market price and  Native go to put in that money bunch of wrong institution J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo get couldn’t do it to reply so the message we’re getting from the government right now seems to be that the firms aren’t able to save themselves and you’re saying poppycock yes started doing the coercion which would be needed to get privacy  Define cry I need another $20 billion a captain. Oh my god that we don’t know if you guys go out and reach Cat you have to do it talk to shareholders why can I just say back to you but I’m here is it because we’re in a in election year because of political pressure we were about to embark on a $1 trillion investment the taxpayer money in the Wall Street system that you think is actually the worst of the three possibilities on the table that you’re actually about to do it , you know it’s gonna happen there’s no reason why dad did you put it enough money into the bank and you don’t talk to time and all the issues up bad incentive and moral hazard if people keep talking about it is please postpone to the future, it’s not gonna happen on might be fun  For politicians with Dr. Maria Kos to do it the phone with no matter what the cost would be worried about doing this and end up my senses. You know we are doing all these things. I have to remind you we don’t know what it is so I’m I’m talking Mbappé a clever design  Bob, right I would postpone judgment to be actually bad at what we from here to situation where hero in the case of Lehman Brothers government cake and I think he will deserve one oh saying well we’re not gonna be allowed everyone trying to reach Cabin Bishounen every cab to pretend they create a Day One camera  1 L we bill out here. Justify the camera on speaker later we talk about filling out the whole system from refusing to be an out Lehman meaning of the entire system. I need some ounces shift gears just a little bit now that we’re picture for me how this is in fact, taxpayers, money, being spent what are my people wanna know about the visual effects on the economy of this kind of thing and if it is the taxpayer money, I think we can all sort of understand that $1 trillion invested it’s called invested right now in the market. Let’s see if we get that back and more of that trillion dollars , we would be saying you can’t use that right now for roads and schools and troops and it’s the one that all those expenses would have to be either cut or picked up from somewhere else because the government could issue Morgan and call Donal be financed by the government and won’t come from cutting it  Off eventually making a choice between certain programs to this program one person wrote in to say what’s the score to do with the price of milk at this point nothing out we have picked the price of milk in the following sentence that Ethan Pak Budi call Nicolette because no labs really have issues on dairy  Milk until one local bank could have a play some boutique production. How old is this the fact of ordinary walking around life trickle down or ripple out text Epha government financial system then I think what it will suggest is a fact of the day next couple of years in terms of Texas to New Orleans, so student loans will not be coming. Call sely mortgage , and then be ready to be easy to get to be available portion of the financial system is proper and balance sheet then you could have what is called unwilling to land and small businesses will have to shut down some of them and Tino ordinary retail credit loans until one will become harder to get back to your news  It’s feels like in moving toward a hypothetical intervention by the government that there are a couple of missed opportunities. What is the opportunity to get Wall Street to perform its self by making Wall Street go out to it’s on shareholders and saying we need to re-capitalize we gotta get more money  in the second is it in a Broner says the trillion dollars is really it’s a divided up by all sorts of taxpayers, all the taxpayers in the country what they’re kinda hoping is it we won’t notice it quite so much with the granular level of each household, but there’s a missed opportunity in terms of what else could be invested in with that money issue is absolutely , could we have the connection earlier and I think all of us and I have to admit I have been surprised by the level of the problems that would be virulence of the market recognize the problems so I would say yes there is a regulatory labs they should have asked forcefully earlier he did not and so it has come back to the taxpayer, but I would also say that many of us, including academics, who don’t have a game called that this was actually deep as well  And just seen it become Rekha Rajon thank you so much that’s planet money for today. Wow what a place Adam’s off talking to our bosses and NPR and we’re trying to figure out what in the heck this mega bail out lightning thanks for listening Friday, September 19 take care .
