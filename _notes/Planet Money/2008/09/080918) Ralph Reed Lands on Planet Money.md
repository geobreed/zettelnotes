I’m all right so I’m gonna get some quick news. Headlines stocks are taking off a check a few hours ago in stocks are doing terribly now their way up so much for gravity or what so much for grabbing people are buying a cheap backstock. John McCain says that the SEC commissioner Chris Rekha should be fired. Clearly John McCain, a big listener hour Podcast , wonderful story about Christopher Cox’s leader ship of the SEC podcast exactly and not a big listener, Dallas Bloomberg, New York, state attorney general Andrew Cuomo someone with a lot of political ambition today is going to probe short-sellers certainly not be blamed for the crisis. We are in later on you’re gonna Laura you’re gonna ask me some questions as many as we can on this podcast on the blog for Twitter we areatwitter.com/planetmoney wanna signupandnpr.org/money we are thrilled to be the number three podcast in iTunes the third most downloaded Lehman Brothers thank you so much we’re going to hear from Ralph read Republican strategist former head of the Christian coalition. He’s gonna talk to us about how this whole crisis switch to the eyes of a steelyard, political and afterwords answer your questions so we’re lucky have republican strategist with that. I want to grab me late for a flight to Winata a jump in with this are you are a Republican strategist you don’t work for the Mahen2 really hoping he wins and I strongly support him and you’re hoping for a house senate time strikes me I am truly  beat but it strikes me really good for Democrats. Your side is in charge Democrats easier time making me a strong with crazy bangs that strikes me as my right I think so I think that anytime that you were the income been partying and come to the White House party your Bude accurately red accurately as the person in charge of manzanilla time and so when you have a financial crisis of this nature wow I think everybody would agree. There’s plenty of blame go around from washer in the wall street it’s probably any day you’re talking about the economy is probably a better day for Barack Obama did John McCain , and that is I think McCain has had some success measurable success in taking the autonomy shit so what is say OK we have a soft autonomy thousand job this calendar year. We had the softest real estate market since the 70s baby sister 30 and we have a credit crisis what’s his plan in the midst of that his plan is to increase the tax on dividends  increase the tax on capital gains. Is that really a good idea we get 9% of all the mortgages in America is Barack Obama he wants to raise the income tax on those making overturn thousand dollars a year which is basically 21 and you can turn it into a tax issue, and that’s why in some polls you’re saying in answer to the question who is better able to manage the economy Obamas  April is now single digits so you’re talking political science newcomer to one of the things that has been interesting for me by getting acquainted with economics is that they do tend to have ideological persuasion they’re just human, but they also talk about economics as more of a little pure science, or pure liberal art, that is that  about economics and what are you talking about a certain facts about physical science as a person as a player in the political landscape how do you reconcile those two things ideology with E economics will keep in mind I was answering a political question so I gave up I think it’s true  I look I’m a political strategist. I’m not gonna apologize for being political that’s kind of when I get paid to do it but I think in terms of economics you obviously get a good day science like physics is there a literally a long gravity there’s certainly people who are serve, hard-core inherence of the Laffer curve. It would argue that when you raise taxes GDP drop  off and so forth I think with regard to the financial crisis I think what we can I’m talking Pierre economics here is is really a perfect score of the unintended consequences. Zastrow‘s hometown of consequences of what we’re at the time you buy almost everyone do you accept sound jackets first was an easy money policy remember we were coming out of the attacks of September 11 we we lost probably one percent of our GDP in one day we lost 600,000 jobs in the financial sector  your tax, so Greenspan the federal reserve wanted to make it easier to get pregnant so after inflation money was Bert that was number one number two you had a state of policy called federal government to increase homeownership. I personally think a good goal I think homeownership is a good goal. I think the average family has 85% of his wealth in his home and for a mini is the first wrong to achieving Fania . Yeah that’s where your equity goes in the third thing that you had was as the equity market either roughly the Internet bubble, including April 2000 and today peoples money was the equity market for real estate and other models other tangible property so you have people it was exaggerator to places like the Florida panhandle in South Florida and places in California investors not homeowners investors will find preconstruction homes lots and condos  and it turned into a gold rush so those three together stated policy of increasing homeownership market easy money from the sad and will swing in the real estate sector has come together and it’s gonna probably take 18.4 months for this pic of Obama fashion is very much more than I had a talk with  democratic side and I and I talk to people so much more than you can. I know that I can sit them down and if I had a list of 100 economical is that is it is it in the interest of the political system of the process 98% agreement , you get elected by saying that that’s gonna ruin everything yeah, in general terms, I tend to look at a little differently at least least this cycle when I have to say I’ve had the current dialogue but you know I look at it on taxes you got one cut the corporate tax rate 34 to 25% you got another one who wants to raise taxes on the brain comes free dramatically  no one has Ryan posing cat games and Gibbons tax increase as amazing party nominee in my lifetime. Remember the first major tax go to cat games to play with son in the wall by Carter so you have that difference with regard to trade I think you’ve got to start this different  in at least to generation seven Barack Obama at least the way exactly what I mentioned no I’m I’m just saying these are real difference in Sanni. He’s he’s critical of NAFTA and says he wants to revisit this is Obama wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement well I’m just hungry Howies Café I did it. I did a lot of reporting on Nata and I will tell you right now Barack Obama Hillary Clinton  outspoken supporters of NAFTA when you act when you talk about the renegotiation by talking about minor irrelevant tweaks we’re not really leading Republicans win Democrats just quickly some of the things they agree trade is good laugh it is good I can’t help people with this, but they told me  the Fed should play a non-political role in our Konomi and should horrible idea in the long term I need to much regulation is an overhaul, smart rod. Yes taxes you’re right totally your public rhetoric totally different running for president in 2012 and Republican here’s my house I want to come out and say I am 98% agreement  with the Democrats would basically say the world the same way I did some minor tweaks. What would you tell what I would do is I would take your voting record as soon as you came out ASAP side-by-side with your phone and I’d be able to demonstrate, but what if I said I don’t care about that all I want is this point I don’t think that I want  another 95% I want you to tell me because I think it’s true you can’t run a 90% look at I don’t think you can get away with running again true I don’t think you can we just disagree. I think that there are real policy differences give an 80% is look don’t invented difference were there isn’t one but we are there’s a difference what’s the point of denying blow it up exploded over 10% difference it to 100% regulation. We know that after the last couple weeks bail out, there’s gonna be a lot of regulation that happens on Wall Street. People are asking for it from the conservative side. What do you want to see for you regulation well, I think with , your likely to see if it’s awfully hard to predict the world because the whole point of Fania was to keep the Morganton market by being able to take Morgan market if I loan you money what’s $100,000 pick a number out of the house for a house and you pay them  I can’t go out one more money until I get back from you sell it then I can take the money I got essential function in a successful operation so every time you do what you can limit the amount of mortgage here so my only message to people is yes we need more regulation. Yes, we need to have stricter control but you better be careful that you don’t kill , and that is the mortgage market if that ceases to function the whole time he’s going to grind to whatever we do with regard to regulation to make capitalism in market, cap of function and transparency, but if it is designed instead to punish people, do you need to be careful because in off  hamstring in the ability of a market was wrong. Are you also saying that right this second we don’t know what the regulation would look like I I think that’s probably right although as I said, I think when when people say well, nobody really, I’ve talked already about the public policy , if you I guess it I guess it was the Wall Street Journal the Federal Reserve is providing you a limit on the moral hazard and so people in the car we’re gonna act rational if I say to you for $100,000 and you can take that money and go down and buy a condo in South Florida, which is increasing in value  people are gonna take the money and go and that’s what happened then and the bubble his personal you Gotta catch a fly. Do thank you thank you very much is the lottery Republican strategist I still got a think it’s a lot easier for the other side they get they can put it all on a T-shirt  or a T-shirt just says he wants to raise your taxes if it works just fine all right well that was helpful from Ralph read it helpful I think if you have some questions yes I do someone in Bluestem rights and to say where is all the bail out money coming from? Is it adding to our debt so far most of it is not adding to our federal reserve bank is a very strange entity , it’s not like any other bank, technically part of the US government own thing but it has a balance has money that it itself has and then in addition, it’s responsible for the money that the US government that’s a little complicated we don’t have to get into all the details but basically it’s not yet. Most of this money has not yet had to work that but eventually the fat does need to get new money from the US government so eventually probably will be added  onto another F something or other just one of the FDIC Peter and some other people I can Charlotte wanna know if the FDIC has something like $51 billion in its reserves to cover bank failures and we get a bunch of bank failures like people are saying right right now. What happens if we get enough failures if they break the bank on it, 51 billion the FDIC has the issue  in mind if they run out of their 50 billion or whatever it is so would that get added to our national debt? Yeah I need either yes terrible what is a diet yes that would make up its current money. OK here’s a question that comes in in a couple of forms from Larry and Heather. They want to know all the billions that were lost in subprime shenanigans and also I think in the stock market this week where did they go money, the global full of money shifting in unprecedented and chaotic ways, Heather says  who’s getting it and how do we get it back there is less money in the world there’s less value in the world and there was your and a half ago when you buy a house for $100,000 and then five years later hundred thousand because other houses in this neighborhood told her that much you didn’t get 100,000 you didn’t steal 100,000 and take 100,000 from someone else. The market affectively there was more value in the world isn’t money  thing money, disappear but you’re saying value is something different value is trapped in this case is denominated in money because if you cashed in the house you would get money you would get money that’s not you would get something like that but I am but yes, I mean as a general rule since the dawn  Austria revolution overall more value this Morgan dollar denominated value in the world every year than here before except for those years my 2008 like 2000 and there’s gonna be a lot of estimation of this that global market capitalization to the value of all stocks in the world has lost $19 trillion  on a base of somewhere around 70 trillion all these are rough just was saying that’s definitely true. No there are people getting rich there are people who are making bets against housing growth against the success of the housing bubble and they made money but if you add of how much they made, and how much the market overall lost we are now down. It’s a smaller world after all it is a smaller world. There is less value in the world. Remember there is , also in London and Shanghai and other parts of it all right Chris so I think it’s probably in some ways a young you because I’m a 16-year-old is very concerned about the damage that is happening now caused by might not not caused by my generation, but will affect my generation more than any other could you just elaborate on what things will look like 5 to 10 years down the road just like you know when you have a flu and you feel awful and you just can’t remember feeling good you can’t imagine feeling good and then you feel good anything  yeah every recession feels awful. One of the worst damages is the damage to confidence and believe in the system cell Christian right now this is a yes we all this is a pretty bad one this is this is a really is a time to question the fundamentals by financial system I don’t think it’s a time to question whether five or 10 years from now and I don’t know if in specific heat 2013 to 2018 mustang or whatever but I think overall we have every reason to imagine economic growth will continue  with overtime, overall economy will be better. Overall, I believe in it that word npr.org/money.
