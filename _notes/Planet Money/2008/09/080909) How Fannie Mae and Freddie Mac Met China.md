Economist Brad Setser obsessively studies the way China buys American debt. If the buying stops, he says, the American economy would be in trouble — and the laws of economic logic suggest that's almost inevitable.

I'm pretty sure you've heard this idea that China and the US are in a crazy kinda codependent relationship. We keep buying stuff from China with our dollars. Then China turns around and lends those dollars right back to us, so we can then buy some more stuff from China. They lend some more money to us and on and on. 

But what you might not know and I didn’t know until very recently, is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, those two companies you’ve heard a lot about lately they are central. They are crucial to that whole recycling of money process. They make it happen or at least they help make it happen.

I’m gonna explain in a second but first let me tell you, I am Adam Davidson international economics correspondent for national public radio and I’m just starting to run something new here in NPR. We’re calling it planet money and our goal is to take the big complex global economic issues. That kind of thing I think most people feel like they really should know a lot about and understand but they don’t and they get really confused. Well, our job here or what we’re trying to do is to make this all easier for you we’re working really hard and hopefully will succeed, at least most of the time, to help you understand how the world economy works and how it affects your life and right now this right here is our first ever podcast. Dun da dam.

Right. So today I’m going to talk to Brad Setser. He’s with the counsel on foreign relations. He’s an economist. Used to work in the treasury department and you should be glad I’m talking to Brad because he knows this financial interdependent relationship between the US and China better than anyone I can think of. 

Over the years, he has really helped me understand how the US and China financial system works and let me just give you the basic idea before we get to Brad. 

So, you buy a DVD player or T-shirt or something made in China. you give your dollars to the store. They take those dollars and give them to some importer, who brought the thing into the country. The importer take some of that money and send a check to China. To the factory that made whatever it is you bought. 

So think of it from the factory owners perspective he’s in China. He’s getting all these dollars, but he has employees he has electric bills. He has all this stuff in China so he doesn’t want dollars. He wants the Chinese currency, renminbi. So what the factory owner does, is he takes those dollars and he brings them to his local bank. There are lots of banks in China, and he says, "Here's a bunch of dollars, I want renminbi." 

Now the bankers dollars, but they don’t really want dollars cause all their customers want renminbi. So every day, this happens every day every business day, all the local banks in China at around four or five in the afternoon, they send a message, they call or email the Central Bank, the peoples Bank of China, and they said, "We’ve got a lot more dollars in today and we don’t want them. We want renminbi." The central bank says, "All right, that’s fine. Give us your dollars and we will send you some renminbi." 

So every day, the peoples Bank of China, gets a huge pile of new dollars that they have to do something with. And Brad is going to tell us in a minute how many dollars it is. It's a lot. So peoples Bank of China don’t wanna just hold onto dollars. Dollars don’t earn interest. They want some kind of investment. But they don’t want any investment. They don’t want some speculative tech stock or some hedge fund, because they’re a central bank. They need to keep this money. They need to know it’s safe. 

So the number one thing they want is US government debt. Treasury bonds. But believe it or not, however big our debt is, and it is big, there aren’t enough treasury bonds to satisfy China’s hunger. 

So the peoples Bank of China buys the next best thing, which it turns out is Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds. Those bonds as it happened, are made up of bundles of US home mortgages. Probably your mortgage, maybe. Put all together in a package, and then sold as bonds.

Now China doesn’t particularly care that these were bonds back my home mortgages. They just like to these bonds were considered really safe, and that they gave some return. Now we in America and many of us. We love this process because what affectively is happening, is every dollar we sent to China, goes through this chain of people and then comes back to us in the form of mortgages. Then Americans, use those mortgages obviously to buy houses then they own their houses. They take out loans against the houses. Home equity lines of credit, and they buy a lot more Chinese made stuff. You see how this cycle works and hopefully now, you see how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are central to this whole cycle.

And the person who knows how all of this works better than anybody is Brad Setser. Well,   probably some guy in the peoples Bank of China, but that guy I don’t know who it is and what he ... probably wouldn’t talk to us anyway. So, we’re very happy to have Brad. 

I started out by asking him, how big is this whole thing how much money are we talking about? 

**(Brad Setser):**
I think it is reasonable to think, that China is buying over the plot of the last 12 months roughly $400 billion in US debt. That’s a lot. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Over a year?

**(Brad Setser):**
Over a year.

**(Adam Davidson):**
So that’s ... . I’m just doing the math, is that per business days? So is that ... ?

**(Brad Setser):**
Per business day it’s about, you know, $2 billion dollars a day. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
That sounds like a lot to me. 

**(Brad Setser):**
It is a lot. At $40 billion is ballpark of the same size is a US fiscal deficit. Is ballpark, the same size as US oil import bill. It is larger, right now than a non oil trade deficit. It is a phenomenal amount of money.

**(Adam Davidson):**
I think of you, as the leading guy studying how much US money China has.

**(Brad Setser):**
I think that is a very polite way of saying I’ve been obsessed with this question for the last five years.

**(Adam Davidson):**
That’s the main thing you’re write about. You have with a China reserve watcher.

**(Brad Setser):**
Yeah, I know I spent a lot of time trying to figure out, just how much, how large is China’s purchases of US bonds were and are ... .

**(Adam Davidson):**
Why is that ... isn't that knowable? I mean, the US government selling it to them? It’s a big Chinese government buying them. Can’t you just look it up somewhere?

**(Brad Setser):**
If only the world were that simple. Oh ho ... . No, you actually can’t. Their ... . US government doesn’t actually sell directly to the China Central Bank. The US government sells a lot of bonds to the broker dealer community, the primary dealers, the buyout treasuries, so ...

**(Adam Davidson):**
Big banks.

**(Brad Setser):**
Think of big banks. Big investment banks, think like ... .

**(Adam Davidson):**
Like a ... .

**(Brad Setser):**
Goldmann Sachs, Citi, JP Morgan, you name it. Household names, the really big, core of the US banking system. They buyout a lot of bonds, and then they sell them to the bank in London and then the bank in London sells the bond to China central bank. 

The US can track the amount of debt they issues and they can track for sale of bonds to foreigners. But in the first instance, it thinks it sold the bonds to a private financial institution in London. And it has no way of knowing then, where that bond if that financial institution is then sell the bond to China Central Bank. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Is that by design? Does China not want us to know?

**(Brad Setser):**
I don't think they're hiding. I think it's just time zones. A lot of times it's just time zones.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Like is there a building full of guys or floor full of guys in Beijing who are just on the phone to London all the time saying, "Hey, we need another ... .

**(Brad Setser):**
This is how someone explain it to me in China. That at the end of every day, the reserve manager in China. Institution of the great state administration of foreign exchange.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Safe

**(Brad Setser):**
Safe. They. The guy gets a call from the peoples Bank of China says, "This, today we ended up, we bought, $2 billion in the market. So you have another $2 billion that you need to put to work." And then he knows OK well I will use bonds mature expiring as I already hold a 1.8 trillion in reserves. So certain amount of that is going, I'm going to get paid on some of the loans and bonds and a lot. A little bit more money to put to work. And since at the end of the business day in China, US is asleep. The natural thing to do is get on the phone and call London. So he gets on the phone and calls London and says, "Hey, how many bonds can you sell me?" And that process it was on, day after day after day. 

Another problem, so we know it’s hard to track it from the US side, then you have to go to the Chinese side, look at Chinese data, and try to figure out how much China’s foreign asset has gone up. Well, Chine central bank is actually really slow in releasing its reserves. Most central bank release their reserve data once a month. China does it once a quarter and sometime ... .

**(Adam Davidson):**
And by release it, you just mean they publish how much ... .

**(Brad Setser):**
Publish on their website how much they hold. And I don’t want to go into the details about how many obscure websites you need to visit in order to try to get a good estimate of how much money to state has. I don’t speak Mandarin I have a friend who does. It's the only way you can possibly find some data series that might give you some basis for doing the estimate. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Wait, is that what you’re doing all the time? 

**(Brad Setser):**
Calling up a friend and begging them to go on the Mandarin language mediacy website?Sometimes, yeah.

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah. Another mean ... . So there’s dozens of weird Chinese, you know ... the Chinese agricultural it's ... .

**(Brad Setser):**
It's actually not ... I mean it's the data on the foreign exchange holding at the state banking system. Which is just a little bit harder to find at the central bank website. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Yeah, Wow.

**(Brad Setser):**
But the hard part is you never quite know where the increase is going to show up. In what data series and sometimes it changes around. You need a little bit of guessing. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
Why are you so obsessed with this? Why not? What why do you wanna know so badly?

**(Brad Setser):**
To me there is a sort of a deep puzzle about the global economy, that for the past several years. Think about puzzle in a lot of different ways. One is that, a relatively poor country, which I guess a post war country, is financing a much wealthier country. We might normally think that the money flow the other way around.

**(Adam Davidson):**
And it ... historically that is the way it work.

**(Brad Setser):**
Historically, yeah.

**(Adam Davidson):**
The rich countries fund the poor countries, just like rich banks fund poor people.

**(Brad Setser):**
Yeah, exactly. 

**(Adam Davidson):**
If you found out ... .

**(Brad Setser):**
Well, sometimes rich banks fund rich people as well, um you know ... .

**(Adam Davidson):**
But if you found out that Citibank was, you know some guys name Frank in Queens was funding Citibank, it's a, that's weird.

**(Brad Setser):**
Yeah, you'll be a little bit ... you kinda wanna know where Frank was kinda get his money. 

But it’s also a very fast growing economy which is financing a slow growing economy. Also, perhaps not the way things normally would.

**(Adam Davidson):**
I mean I’m hearing this is an intellectual curiosity like, you could do crossword puzzles. Instead you figuring out how much US debt the Chinese government has. It’s not that you wake up every morning going, "Oh my God. Will my standard of living collapse and will the US economy fall apart?" It's, "Wow, this is really weird. I wan’t to understand this". 

**(Brad Setser):**
Well, I think the initial motivation were also a little based on the concern. The concern was that the US can go on forever. And than the more times we're looking ... and then yeah. I actually written a paper that saying that we couldn’t go on forever. And then we make a public prediction that something is'nt gonna go on forever and it seems to keep going on long past the point that we say it wouldn't. You kind of get interested

american buy and return as mortgages

US doesn't sell directly to central bank in china, to brokerage, jp morgan, to financial center in london, then to central bank china. 

China doesn't know.
