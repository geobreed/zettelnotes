I want this to be my second brain. Where I can upload my thoughts for easy access. So it has to be able to:
- quick input, maybe cross platform or cross app with custom formatting for obsidian. 
- Easy search, easy to retrieve any information or data. 
- Relevance, for topic jumping to easy segue or for book creation. 
- Graph view of all topic. 
- Story collection, with beat point

One complication is that a wishlist is not an actual function. What will I do with this?

I construct this according to zettellkasten, where the relation between notes is the point although this means notes recognition and familiarity also important. This construction is very good for article or book creation. 

My first creation is based on some example of integrating Obsidian, Jekyll, and Netlify and my [[Initial PKM Information]]
